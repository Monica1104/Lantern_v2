Abstract
The impact of bullying and sexual harassment on six outcomes (self esteem, mental and physical
health, trauma symptoms, life satisfaction, and substance abuse) among middle school girls were
compared to the outcomes among high school girls. One hundred seventy-seven middle school
and fifty-eight high school girls drawn from suburban schools in the northeast comprised the
sample for this study. The bullying and sexual harassment were adapted from Espelage (2001)
and AAUW (1998, 2001), respectively. High school girls experienced more bullying and sexual
harassment and poorer health outcomes than their middle school counterparts. However, the
impact of sexual harassment, and especially bullying, is less for each outcome after middle
school. Consequently, poorer health outcomes among high school girls cannot be attributed in a
straightforward manner to bullying or sexual harassment since these outcomes are poorer among
non-bullied and non-harassed high school girls compared to similar middle schoolers. There
were no significant relationships between race, disability status, bullying and sexual harassment.
Lesbian girls, however, experienced more public sexual harassment and ridicule, especially in
middle school, than their heterosexual counterparts.
Our analyses suggest that girls continue to experience sexual harassment and bullying
after middle school as a result of dominance and control strategies used by adolescents, in
particular, boys. The fact that health outcomes are less impacted in high school by these
behaviors may well be the result of better support systems and coping mechanisms among high
school girls and more developmental changes among middle school girls.

The Impact of Bullying and Sexual Harassment on Health Outcomes of Middle and High
School Girls
From kindergarten to high school, bullying and sexual harassment are familiar
experiences for many students. These frequently linked, negative behaviors have received much
attention over the past decade, but for the most part they have been studied separately. Only two
studies have explored and compared sexual harassment and bullying behaviors within the same
sample. Both of these explored the characteristics and behaviors of bullies and sexual harassers
without examining the characteristics of or impact on bullied and harassed children in Canadian
and American schools (Pepler, Craig, Connolly, & Henderson, 2002; Pellegrini, 2001). These
problems have placed educators in the uneasy position of trying to study two frequently
occurring problems in school without fully understanding the impact of each. Are bullying and
sexual harassment damaging for children in different ways? And if so based on what? Gender?
Age? Sexual orientation? Disability? There have been studies that highlight the psychosocial
outcomes of bullying and sexual harassment but the literature is Balkanized. No studies have
combined these two types of behaviors so that mental and physical health outcomes can be
compared by differences based on gender, age, sexual orientation or disability.

Bullying and Sexual Harassment Origins and Definition
Information regarding bullying and sexual harassment has slowly evolved since the
1970's but from two very different origins. Sexual harassment laws and policies developed in
the U.S. as a part of civil rights laws where it was viewed as a form of discrimination. Policies on
bullying, on the other hand, focused on anti-social, aggressive behavior that had links to criminal
conduct. Today, due to a number of school shootings over the past decade, the issue is wed to
school safety. Olweus's (1978) study of aggressive children in Norway is considered to be the
start of bullying research. Great Britain, Canada and Australia as well as the U.S. have
developed this area significantly.
Generally, bullying has been defined in the following way: "Bullying is a specific type of
aggression in which (1) the behavior is intended to harm or disturb, (2) the behavior occurs
repeatedly over time, and (3) there is an imbalance of power, with a more powerful person or
group attacking a less powerful one. This asymmetry of power may be physical or
psychological, and the aggressive behavior may be verbal (e.g. name calling, threats), physical
(e.g. hitting), or psychological (e.g. rumors, shunning/exclusion) (Nansel, 2001). Typically
bullies have been described as "aggressive children who use aggression in a systematic and
calculated way with a group of weaker peers (Crick, 1996; Olweus, 1993; Pellegrini, 2001;
Schwartz et al., 1997).
In 1997, the U.S Department of Education developed the following definition for sexual
harassment that occurs in schools. "Sexual harassment is defined as unwelcome sexual advances,
requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, nonverbal, or physical conduct of a sexual nature by
an employee, by another student, or by a third party, that is sufficiently severe, persistent, or
pervasive to limit a student’s ability to participate in or benefit from an education program or

school and high school girls. Violence Against Women, 13, (2), 627-643.
activity, or to create a hostile or abusive educational environment" (Department of Education
1997, p. 12038).
Students' experience of sexual harassment in a school setting may include the following
unwanted or unwelcome behaviors from other students or adult school personnel: sexual
comments, jokes, gestures, rumors or looks; showing of sexual pictures, photographs,
illustrations; written sexual messages, notes or graffiti on bathroom walls or locker rooms; being
called gay or lesbian in a malicious manner; spied on while dressing or showering at school;
'flashed' or ‘mooned' by someone; touched, grabbed, or pinched in a sexual way; clothing pulled
off or down in a sexual way; intentionally brushed up against by someone in a sexual way;
blocked or cornered in a sexual way; and, forced to kiss someone, or experience some other
unwelcome sexual behavior other than kissing (AAUW, 1993, 2001). Sexual harassment may
also include “spiking” or pulling down someone’s pants, “snuggies” where underwear is pulled
up at the waist so it goes in between the buttocks, and or being listed in “slam books” which
identify student’s names and have derogatory sexual comments written about them that are
circulated by other students (Strauss & Espeland, 1992).
Incidence of Bullying and Sexual Harassment
Previous research on bullying and sexual harassment conducted in schools confirms that
both types of these behaviors are widespread. Three national studies of bullying and SH provide
the broadest statistics regarding these behaviors in U.S. schools. The United States Department
of Education School Crime Supplement to the National Crime Victimization Survey (2003)
reported that in 2001 8% of middle and high school students were bullied (9% males, 7%
females) up 3% from 1999. Grade level made a difference: 14 % of 6th graders, 9 % of 9th
graders, and 2 % of 12th graders reported that they had been bullied at school. Similarly

school and high school girls. Violence Against Women, 13, (2), 627-643.
reflecting the student's responses, principals reported bullying as a problem in 25-29% of
elementary schools while 43 % of middle school principals reported bullying as a problem. In
another study on bullying, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
(1998) indicated that one third of children in grades 6 through 10 are directly involved in
bullying, with 10 % as bullies, 13% as victims and 6% as both. The frequency of bullying was
higher among 6th-8th grade students than among 9th-10th graders.
The American Association of University Women (AAUW) conducted two national
studies of sexual harassment in U.S. schools in 1993 and 2001. Both had similar results,
reporting that 81% of students experienced some form of SH during their school years. Fiftynine were harassed occasionally and 27% were targeted often (2001). Additionally, 54% of
students said they sexually harassed someone during their school lives. Similar to bullying, grade
level makes a difference; but in contrast to bullying, sexual harassment increases with age: 55 %
of 8-9th graders and 61 % of 10-11th graders reported that they had been physically sexually
harassed at school. Girls experienced higher frequency of harassment in both grade categories.
Mental and Physical Health Outcomes of Bullying and Sexual Harassment Victimization
Nansel et al. (2001) state that research on bullies and those bullied has consistently found
that "youth who are bullied generally show higher levels of insecurity, anxiety, depression,
loneliness, unhappiness, physical and mental symptoms, and low self esteem" (p.2095). Research
by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (1998) found that students
who were bullied experienced greater difficulty making friends, poorer relationships with
classmates, and greater loneliness. Additional study by Hawker & Boulton (2000) showed that
bullied kids were five times more likely to be depressed. Espelage (2001) investigated depression
among children who were bullied and found that 20% of middle school victims scored within the

6

Gruber, J.E., & Fineran, S. (2007).The impact of bullying and sexual harassment on middle
school and high school girls. Violence Against Women, 13, (2), 627-643.
clinical range on a standard depression and anxiety measure. Hazler, Hoover and Oliver (1992)
found that 90% of bullied students experienced a drop in school grades, while Kochenderfer and
Ladd (1996) showed that bullying victimization was related to school absenteeism or dropping
out.
According to the AAWW studies (1993, 2001) students experiencing sexual harassment
report negative psychosocial effects such as depression, loss of appetite, nightmares or disturbed
sleep, low self esteem and feelings of being sad, afraid, scared, or embarrassed (Hand &
Sanchez, 2000; Lee et al., 1996). Similar to bullying victims, students also report loss of interest
in regular activities, isolation from friends and family, and loss of friends. School performance
difficulties include absenteeism, decreased quality of schoolwork, skipping or dropping classes,
poor grades, tardiness and truancy (AAUW, 1993, 2001; Corbett, Gentry, and Pearson, 1993;
Hand and Sanchez, 2000; Lee et al., 1996; Loredo, Reid, and Deaux, 1995; PCSW, 1995;
Roscoe, Strouse, and Goodwin, 1994; Shakeshaft et al., 1995; Stein, Marshall & Tropp, 1993;
Stratton and Backes, 1997; Trigg and Wittenstrom, 1996). Students also reported feeling afraid,
upset or threatened by the sexual harassment (AAUW, 1993, 2001; Fineran & Bennett, 1999;
PCSW, 1995; Stein, Marshall & Tropp, 1993).
Studies That Examined Both Bullying and Sexual Harassment
As mentioned earlier in this article, only two studies have analyzed both bullying and
sexual harassment. Pellegrini (2001) and Pepler et al. (2002) focused on the perpetrators of both
of these problems. Pellegrini's (2001) longitudinal study of U.S. 6th and 7th grade students, found
that "bullies (who tended to be boys) also engaged in sexual harassment, and this relation was
mediated by self-reported dating frequency…. That is, bullies who also estimated their frequency
of dating to be high…tended to sexually harass their peers"(p. 131). Thus, if bullies become

school and high school girls. Violence Against Women, 13, (2), 627-643.
interested in opposite-sex dating, this will increase their proclivity to become perpetrators of
sexual harassment. Pellegrini also found that sexual harassment behaviors at the end of 7th grade
were predicted by bullying at the start of 6th grade. Pepler, et al. (2002) studied four cohorts of
students in Canadian schools grades 5-8 and examined the relationship between aggressive
behavior and substance use. They found that students who bullied others were at significant risk
for substance abuse before entering high school. Results also indicated that girls or boys who
acknowledged sexually harassing others were between four and six times more likely to use
alcohol than those who did not sexually harass their peers.
Gender, Sexual Orientation and Disability and Bullying and Sexual Harassment
The AAUW (1993, 2001) reports indicate that over 50% of male and female students
experienced sexual comments, jokes, gestures or looks. Over 30% of boys and girls experienced
being touched, grabbed, pinched or brushed up against in a sexual way from schoolmates. In a
study by Fineran & Bennett, (1999) unwanted sexual attention including pressure for dates and
sex was reported by approximately 43% of girls and 30% of boys, while in the PCSW (1995)
studies, 25% of girls and 5% of boys reported unwanted sexual attention. Gender differences in
victimization are common with girls experiencing sexual harassment more frequently than boys
and boys perpetrating sexual harassment more frequently than girls (AAUW, 1993, 2001;
Fineran & Bennett, 1999; Hand and Sanchez, 2000; Lee et al., 1996; McMaster, Connolly,
Pepler & Craig, 2002; PCSW, 1995; Stratton and Backes, 1997; Trigg and Wittenstrom, 1996.
Nansel et al. (2001), found that males both bullied others and were bullied significantly more
often than females. Results also showed that females experienced being bullied more frequently
through the use of rumors and sexual comments while males reported being bullied by being hit,
slapped or pushed. Hawker and Boulton (2000), conducted a meta-analysis of studies on peer

Gruber, J.E., & Fineran, S. (2007).The impact of bullying and sexual harassment on middle
school and high school girls. Violence Against Women, 13, (2), 627-643.
victimization occurring over the past 20 years, and found that bullied boys are four times more
likely to be suicidal while bullied girls are eight times more likely to be suicidal.
Current literature on sexual harassment or bullying contributes little insight into the
mental and physical health risks of sexual minority or disabled students since research to date
has not included information on sexual orientation or disability. However, the limited research to
date is compelling. A study in Great Britain found that almost two thirds of children with special
needs identified being bullied compared to only one quarter of mainstreamed children
(Thompson, Whitney, & Smith, 1994). An annual school survey, The Massachusetts Youth Risk
Behavior Survey (Commonwealth of Massachusetts, April 1998) compared gay, lesbian and
bisexual students to their peers. Results showed that sexual minority students were four times
more likely to have attempted suicide, and five times more likely to have missed school because
of feeling unsafe. These behaviors parallel the behaviors of students in the general school
population experiencing sexual harassment and bullying. Fineran (2002a, 2002b) found that
students with disabilities experienced significantly more sexual harassment in school from
classmates than non-disabled. Also, lesbian girls experienced significantly more sexual
harassment than heterosexual girls.
Purpose of the Study
Research on sexual harassment and bullying in schools is at a crossroads. At this point in
time, these problems have been treated as separate issues by researchers. Standardized measures
of health and academic outcomes that have been used in other types of research on adolescents
have not been used consistently in bullying or sexual harassment studies. A unique aspect of this
study is the use of a survey instrument with a number of psychometrically sound measures of
health variables.

Methods
Sample
Data were drawn from 369 middle school and 199 high school students from four suburban
New England schools (two middle schools and two high schools) who completed paper and
pencil surveys. Similar to their local communities, the middle and high school demographics
reflect a predominantly white population (86%) with little ethnic diversity (0.8% African
Americans, 0.9% Asians/Pacific Islanders and 6.7% Latinos). Students were surveyed about their
sexual orientation and whether they had a disability. Most students (95%) listed themselves as
heterosexual. Nine percent of the respondents reported they had a disability. Participation in the
survey was voluntary and followed Institutional Review Board procedures for parental consent
and student assent. Questions covered a range of topics including student experiences with
sexual harassment and bullying, health and well being, and attitudes towards school and teachers.
Grades 10-12 were drawn from vocational high school that had a higher percentage of male
students.
Measures
Bullying and Sexual Harassment. Ten survey items developed by Espelange (1993) and
fourteen items used in the AAUW survey (2001) to measure bullying and sexual harassment,
respectively, were presented. Students were asked to indicate how often they had experienced
each behavior (Never, A few times, Many times) during the school, who the perpetrators were
(Mostly male, Mostly female) and their reaction (Not upset, Somewhat upset, Very upset). A
factor analysis of the bullying items with varimax rotation resulted in a two-factor solution. The
factor items were used subsequently to create scales labeled Intimidation and Ridicule. Ridicule
included these individual items: upset you for the fun of it, teased you, picked on you, made fun

10

Gruber, J.E., & Fineran, S. (2007).The impact of bullying and sexual harassment on middle
school and high school girls. Violence Against Women, 13, (2), 627-643.
of you, and called you names. Intimidation included: scared you, got into a physical fight with
you, pushed, shoved, slapped, or kicked you, and threatened to hurt or hurt you. Each scale had
high reliability based on Cronbach's alpha: Intimidation (alpha=.84 ); Ridicule (alpha=. 91). A
factor analysis of the sexual harassment items with a varimax rotation resulted in two factors that
produced high reliability scores. These factors tapped two different aspects of experience--one
which often occurs before an audience or involves a number of others (wrote sexual messages
about you on bathroom walls, locker rooms, class blackboards, etc; listed you in a "slam book"
with offensive sexual remarks about you; told offensive, sexual jokes about you; called you gay
or lesbian or a name like fag or dyke; and spread sexual rumors about you), and the other which
is typically one-on-one and seeks intimacy inappropriately and/or control (kissed or hugged you
when you did not want it, pulled your clothing off or down, touched, grabbed, or pinched you in
a sexual manner, pressured you for a date, and flashed or mooned you). The individual items of
each factor were summed to create two scales, Public Sexual Harassment (alpha=.88) and
Unwanted Personal Advances (alpha=.79).
Health Outcomes. Six outcome variables were used in this analysis because that tapped
different dimensions of overall health and well being. Self Esteem was measured by four items
developed by Bowen and Richman (1995) for use with adolescents: I feel positive about myself;
I am satisfied with myself; I have a number of good qualities; and, I am able to do things as well
as most other people. The items were summed to produce a scale with a range of 4-12 where
M=6.26, SD=2.2 (alpha=.90 ). Mental and physical health were assessed by using items
developed by Bowen and Richman (1995). The Mental Health scale (alpha=.81) consisted of six
items which tapped evaluations such as feeling successful, being pleased with self, or feeling
lonely or fearful. Students were asked to indicate how often they felt that way in the last week.

Gruber, J.E., & Fineran, S. (2007).The impact of bullying and sexual harassment on middle
school and high school girls. Violence Against Women, 13, (2), 627-643.
A scale was created by combining these items (range=1-11; M=5.61; SD=2,7) A Physical Health
scale was developed from a factor analysis of twelve items. Seven items that formed a factor
(alpha=.83) were used to create a scale (range=1-12; M=5.81; SD=3.4) These items asked
students how often they had experienced such problems as trouble going to sleep, upset
stomach/stomach ache, headache, or dizziness in the last seven days. Impact of Events Scale
(Trauma Symptoms) was based on eight items (alpha=.91 ) developed by Dyregrov and Yule
(1995) to use with children. The respondents were asked how frequently (Not at all, Rarely,
Sometimes, or Often) each item applied to them regarding their most upsetting bullying or sexual
harassment experience (e.g., I thought about it when I didn't mean to, I had waves of strong
feelings about it, pictures of it popped into my mind). The combined items resulted in a scale
with 1-10 range where M=5.19 and SD=3.2.Life Satisfaction was based on Kunin's Faces Scale.
The students were asked to circle one of five faces from happy (1) to sad (5) that "is closest to
how you feel about your life in general" (M=2.33, SD=1.0) Substance Abuse was measured by a
single item in a 13-item instrument developed by Hanisch and Hulin (1991) to measure
workplace stress. The wording of the items was changed to reflect school or school activities
(range=1-5; M=1.47; SD=1.0)
Results
Bullying and Sexual Harassment Experiences.
In order to provide a general overview of bullying and sexual harassment we thought it would be
useful to study the individual items which occur most frequently for each of the bullying and
sexual harassment constructs, their impact, and the perpetrators for middle school and high
school girls These figures are presented in Table 1.
------------------------------------------------

school and high school girls. Violence Against Women, 13, (2), 627-643.
Table 1 about here
-----------------------------------------------Several conclusions can be drawn. First, the most common experiences in middle school tend to
be the most common experiences in high school--e.g., upsetting someone for the fun of it,
spreading sexual rumors, scaring or hurting a person, and grabbing and kissing have similar
percentage ranks at both grade levels. Second, the frequency of bullying and sexual harassment
increases from middle school to high school as can be seen by comparing the same experience
between the two grade levels (e.g., upset for the fun of it (42% to 53%), spreading sexual rumors
(33% to 53%)). Also, though girls are the main perpetrators of several types of experiencing-hurting, pushing, and spreading sexual rumors--boys play significant roles as perpetrators,
especially in high school. Finally, some types of experiences tend to be more upsetting than
others at both grade levels. Having sexual rumors spread about oneself is more upsetting than
any other experience. Being picked on or made fun of, as well as having to endure sexual jokes
or unwanted kissing are also very upsetting experiences. An analysis (not shown) of the
relationships between race, disability, and sexual orientation on each type of bullying and sexual
harassment for middle and high school girls yielded disappointing results. Neither race nor
disability was significantly related to either bullying or sexual harassment. However, sexual
orientation, bullying, and sexual harassment were significantly related in cross-tabulation
analysis. Lesbian middle school girls were more apt to experience Ridicule and Public Sexual
Harassment than their heterosexual peers (p<. 01). Among high school students, lesbians
experienced more Public Sexual Harassment than their heterosexual sisters (p<. 05)
Health Outcomes for Middle and High School Girls

school and high school girls. Violence Against Women, 13, (2), 627-643.
Adolescence presents a number of social, emotional, and academic challenges for both girls and
boys. Adolescent sexual development and maturity are other avenues that offer insight into the
context of bullying or peer sexual harassment and its effect on adolescent mental health. Current
adolescent theorists, as summarized by Hutchison (1999) believe that all adolescents experience
biological, psychological, and social change between the ages of 11-20 and students who
experience bullying or sexual harassment in the first phase of early adolescence may find it to be
a different experience than students who are in the later phases of adolescence. For girls,
conformity with peer group, emphasis on beauty/attractiveness, and dating may contribute to
excess stress and negative health outcomes regarding their appearance and peer group status.
Difference of means tests comparing middle and high school girls on each of the outcomes
reveals substantial evidence for a decline in health during high school. (See Table 2).
----------------------------------------------------Table 2 about here
----------------------------------------------------For four outcomes--mental health (M=7.37 vs. 6.15), physical health (M=6.23 vs. 7.32), life
satisfaction (M=2.58 vs. 2.19), and substance abuse (M=1.71 vs. 1.31), high schools girls have
significantly poorer outcomes than their middle school counterparts. High school girls also report
higher levels of trauma and lower levels of self esteem but these differences are not statistically
significant.
In the previous section of our analysis we found that high school girls experience
bullying and sexual harassment more frequently than their middle school sisters. It is possible
that these experiences have a deleterious effect on girls' health in high school. We explore these
connections in detail in the next section.

school and high school girls. Violence Against Women, 13, (2), 627-643.
The Impact of Bullying and Sexual Harassment on Health Outcomes.
An analysis of the impact of bullying and sexual harassment on health was performed by
comparing those who had or had experienced two forms of bullying (intimidation and ridicule)
or two forms of sexual harassment (public and personal) with each health outcome. The results
of these analyses for bullying are presented in Table 3.
------------------------------------------------Table 3 about here
-------------------------------------------------As the results from our earlier analyses (Table 1) suggest, Ridicule occurs at higher levels in
middle (51.5) and high school (58.2%) than Intimidation (25.4% and 34.5 %). Also, the
frequency of Ridicule and Intimidation are higher in high school, as Table 1 suggested.
An analysis of t-tests results reveals that bullying has more impact on middle school girls'
health outcomes than for high school girls. Intimidation is related to five outcomes for middle
school girls (self esteem, mental and physical health, life satisfaction, and substance abuse), but
only one (trauma symptoms) for high school girls. Following a similar pattern, Ridicule affects
more health outcomes in middle school (self esteem, mental and physical health, trauma
symptoms, and life satisfaction) than in high school (self esteem and trauma symptoms). Out of
twelve t-tests for each grade group, ten are statistically significant for middle school but only
three are for high school. Mental and physical health, life satisfaction, and substance abuse are
not related to either form of bullying among high school girls. The results for sexual harassment
and health outcomes reveal patterns that are somewhat analogous to bullying and organized in
Table 4.

Gruber, J.E., & Fineran, S. (2007).The impact of bullying and sexual harassment on middle
school and high school girls. Violence Against Women, 13, (2), 627-643.
Table 4 about here
-------------------------------------------------The levels of both public (38.4% vs. 60.3%) and personal --- (33.9% vs. 48.3%) harassment are
higher in high school but the impact of each type is greater in middle school. Among middle
school girls, public sexual harassment is significantly related to all six health outcomes;
unwanted personal advances is related to five. In contrast, among high school students public
harassment is significantly related to four outcomes (mental and physical health, trauma
symptoms, and life satisfaction) while unwanted personal advances is related to three (physical
health, trauma symptoms, substance abuse).
An overview of bullying and sexual harassment and health outcomes (Tables 3 and 4)
provides some interesting insights into the school lives of adolescent girls. In general, while both
bullying and sexual harassment increase in high school, the impact of these experiences on their
well-being seems to diminish comparatively. Among middle school girls, bullying and sexual
harassment have nearly the same number of significant relationships to health outcomes (11 and
10, respectively). For high school girls, sexual harassment affects more health outcomes (7) than
bullying (3) does. Based on our analyses, poorer health outcomes among high school girls (Table
2) cannot be attributed in a straightforward way to increased levels of bullying and sexual
harassment (Tables 3 and 4) since the health outcomes are generally poorer among high school
girls who have not been bullied or harassed compared to the same outcomes for non-victimized
middle schoolers. Because of the relatively small number of non-whites, disabled students, and
lesbians, it was not possible to draw meaningful results from data analyses that compared the
health outcomes of these students to their peers who had experienced bullying or sexual
harassment.

A final question is: Does bullying or sexual harassment produce worse health outcomes?
The data in Tables 3 and 4 reveal that the two types of sexual harassment are significantly related
to a larger number of outcomes than are the two types of bullying (18 versus 13). This difference
is especially notable in high school where only three of a possible twelve statistical tests are
significant (Table 3). If we focus on each bullying and sexual harassment type, which has the
poorest score on each outcome among each age group? Public sexual harassment had higher
scores (poorer outcomes) than ridicule, intimidation, and unwanted personal advances for both
middle and high school girls on five of six outcomes. However, in most cases these worst
outcomes were not significantly worse. Only five of thirty-six comparisons (4 in middle school, 1
in high school) were significant at p <. 05.1
Discussion and Conclusions
Results from this study and many others leave no doubt that both bullying and sexual
harassment have a profound negative impact on girls' health. An interesting finding from this
study indicates that the frequency of both bullying and sexual harassment increases from middle
school to high school. This is in contrast to the bullying literature that shows bullying decreasing
with age (Nansel, 2001). This difference may be attributable in part to the small number of girls
in our high school sample. In a number of instances, girls contributed substantially to acts of
bullying and sexual harassment, especially during middle school. Some types of behavior--e.g.,
spreading sexual rumors, trying to hurt someone--are strategies used by girls to control or
intimidate other girls. Studies have consistently found that girls are more apt to be injured or to
have experienced more negative behaviors than boys, thus leading to more negative outcomes
(Lee et al., 1996, Molidor, 1999).

school and high school girls. Violence Against Women, 13, (2), 627-643.
The later stage of adolescent development for girls may be more problematic and explain
why high school girls have significantly poorer outcomes than middle school girls, regardless of
whether or not they were bullied or harassed. Our research suggests that high school girls are
less vulnerable to the negative impacts of bullying and sexual harassment than their middle
school sisters. While in a number of instances higher percentages of high school students say
they were upset by a particular experience than were middle school girls (Table 1), the fact that
these experiences had less impact on the health outcomes of the former (Tables 3 and 4) suggests
that older girls are able to insulate themselves from the potentially adverse health effects of
unwanted behavior. While they may have developed coping strategies and peer group support to
deal with bullying and sexual harassment, it is likely they face a host of new challenges that
negatively impact their health.
In our examination of substance use by students in response to sexual harassment
victimization, we found that high school girls reported more frequency of use of alcohol or drugs
than middle school girls, but for middle school girls, substance use was related to bullying. This
finding would support that both high school students and middle school students may use
substances as a coping mechanism for upsetting events thus paralleling substance use by adults
under stressful circumstances.
Our sample of girls reporting to be lesbian or bisexual indicated that they experienced
significantly more public sexual harassment in high school. Middle school girls experienced
significantly more public sexual harassment and ridicule. These results lend support to the need
for both middle and high schools to be aware that sexual minority students are at risk and that
these issues need to be addressed by school personnel beginning in middle school.

school and high school girls. Violence Against Women, 13, (2), 627-643.
As attention to the role of bullying and harassment in school violence has increased, it is
important to acquire empirical information about victimization experiences. Results from this
study indicate that both sexual harassment and bullying negatively affect girls' self esteem and
well-being. Although high school girls appear to be better defended against bullying and sexual
harassment, their overall well-being appears to be poorer and so any type of contribution to
improving their school environment could be potentially rewarding. Middle school girls were
found to be more vulnerable to both bullying and sexual harassment thus pointing out the need
for school administrators to pay closer attention to eliminating these behaviors from school
environments in the lower grades. School administrators should ensure that prevention training
addressing both of these behaviors is provided equally. Bullying prevention in schools has by far
outpaced sexual harassment prevention training and this may be to the detriment of girls' wellbeing and educational achievement. There may be some subtle differences in outcomes from
these two different experiences for middle school girls and high school girls but having schools
remain focused on eliminating both types of behaviors is important.
The small number of adolescents with disabilities or who described themselves as nonheterosexual impeded our ability to conduct meaningful statistical analyses of their experiences
and outcomes. Also, our sample was drawn from schools with predominately white populations.
A larger and more diverse sample would have enabled us to generalize our findings more widely.

Notes
1

The mean scores for each outcome with each bullying and harassment type were

compared through t-tests. The mean outcome that was highest (poorest) on a particular type of
bullying or sexual harassment was compared with the other three scores on the same outcome.
This resulted in 18 t-test (6 outcomes by 3 t-test comparisons) for each grade level. Among
middle schoolers, Unwanted personal advances had a significantly higher score on physical
health than ridicule did; public sexual harassment had significantly higher scores on trauma
symptoms than intimidation and unwanted personal advances; and public sexual harassment had
a higher mean score on life satisfaction than intimidation did. Among high school girls, public
sexual harassment had a higher mean score on physical health than intimidation did.

The respondents were asked how much they were bothered or upset by the experience. The three

response categories were not upset, somewhat upset, and very upset. The latter categories were combined.
b

There were two response categories, mainly boys and mainly girls. Since a number of respondents

circled both categories, a third category, "both," was added during data coding. The percentages for "both" are not
shown.
