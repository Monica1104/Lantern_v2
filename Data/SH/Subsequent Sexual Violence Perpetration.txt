Purpose: This study examines the association between bullying experiences and sexual violence (SV)
perpetration among a sample of middle school students (n ⫽ 1391; males and females in grades 5– 8) across
ﬁve middle schools in a Midwestern state.
Methods: We include waves 1 and 2 of a larger longitudinal study that aimed to track the overlap between
bullying and SV victimization and/or perpetration across a 3-year period. Wave 1 data were collected in the
spring of 2008, and wave 2 data were collected in the fall of 2008. Student participants completed a series of
scales in a paper and pencil survey. After missing data imputation, a total sample of 1391 students was
analyzed.
Results: Using cutoff scores, 12% of males and 12% of females could be considered bully perpetrators.
Thirty-two percent of the boys (22% of girls) reported making sexual comments to other students, 5% of boys
(7% of girls) spread a sexual rumor, and 4% of boys (2% of girls) pulled at someone’s clothing. Bullying
perpetration and homophobic teasing were signiﬁcant predictors of sexual harassment perpetration over
time.
Conclusions: Given the overlap among bullying, homophobic teasing perpetration, and SV perpetration,
future studies should address the link among these forms of aggression so that prevention programs can be
enhanced to address gender-based bullying and sexual harassment.

Youth bullying experiences and sexual violence (SV) perpetration are major public health problems, and although existing
literature suggests that they may share some correlates, there is
no established empirical link in the literature between bullying
and co-occurring or subsequent SV perpetration during the middle school years [1]. Despite this lack of evidence, rape prevention educators have increasingly focused on implementing bullying prevention in schools because it is easier to gain access to
schools with bullying prevention than with SV prevention programs. Thus, it is imperative that research be conducted on the

overlap of bullying perpetration and SV perpetration during
early adolescence.
A large U.S. study estimated that 30% of 6th through 10th
grade students reported moderate-to-frequent involvement in
bullying at school; 13% as bullies only and 11% as victims only [2].
Overall, “A student is being bullied or victimized when he or she
is exposed, repeatedly and over time, to negative actions on the
part of one or more students” [3], and includes verbal, physical,
and relational aspects [4]. SV encompasses a continuum of acts
from unwanted noncontact exposures of a sexual nature (e.g.,
verbal harassment) to forcible penetration [5]. Examining completed penetration only, the 2007 Youth Risk Behavior Survey, a
national survey of students in grades 9 –12, found a lifetime
reported prevalence of unwanted physically forced sexual intercourse of 10.5% for females and 4.5% for males [6]. Furthermore,
Banyard et al [7] found that of a sample of 980 adolescents in
grades 7–12, 10% of males and 2.5% of females reported perpe-

trating sexual coercion (e.g., unwanted kissing, touching, or intercourse). Sexual harassment perpetration is common among
school-aged adolescents, with one national study reporting peer
harassment rates of 66% and 52% for boys and girls, respectively
[8].
Homophobia is deﬁned as negative attitudes and behaviors
directed toward individuals who identify as or are perceived to
be lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender [9]. In many ways, the
behaviors that constitute homophobic teasing overlap conceptually with “bullying” or “SV,” as it may include, for example,
relational aggression, or sexual harassment, or assault. Rivers
[10] reported that name-calling, being hit or kicked, as well as
teasing, were frequent forms of bullying experienced by lesbian,
gay, and bisexual students (60%, 82%, and 58%, respectively).
Homophobic teasing may play an important role in the link
between bullying perpetration and SV perpetration. What conceptually distinguishes homophobic teasing from bullying and
SV appears to be the direct intention of homophobic teasing to
express and promote masculinity for all students, not just lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth.
Only four studies have reported positive associations between bullying and SV experiences. The ﬁrst study conducted by
Gruber and Fineran [11] focused on bullying and sexual harassment victimization, and the other three examined bullying perpetration and sexual harassment perpetration [12–14]. These
studies indicated that youth who engage in bullying also engage
in sexual harassment. Although theoretical overlaps exist in the
bullying and SV literature [1], the current study attempted to
examine the empirical link between bullying perpetration and
SV perpetration among an understudied population—young adolescents. We propose the existence of a bully-SV pathway in
which bullying perpetration and homophobic teasing are hypothesized to be predictive of SV perpetration over time among a
large sample of middle school students. We posit that bullying
might be a precursor to SV perpetration. It stands to reason that
the need for control and dominance that underlies bullying is
transferred to increasingly escalating forms of aggression and
into relationships characteristic of the developing adolescent.
That is, bullying in the form of name-calling and rumor spreading
has been associated with homophobic teasing [1], which creates
an environment in which adolescent peer groups make fun of
students who express behaviors that are not consistent with
their gender. For example, boys are expected to act masculine
and girls are expected to be feminine [15]. We posit that when
students exchange homophobic teasing, then SV perpetration
might develop. In other words, a bully perpetrator who also
uses homophobic teasing may turn to SV perpetration when
opposite-gender attraction develops and restricted gender expression is promoted.
This article provides prevalence estimates of bullying perpetration, homophobic teasing, and two subtypes of SV perpetration: (1) sexual harassment, including unwanted sexual comments, sexual rumor spreading, or groping [6], and (2) forced
sexual contact, including unwanted nonpenetrative or penetrative forced sexual acts. We hypothesize that males would display
more SV perpetration and homophobic teasing than females, but
no gender differences would emerge for bullying perpetration
[16]. We expect that African American and Caucasian students
would report similar levels of SV and bullying perpetration, given
the lack of racial differences in the theoretical or empirical literature [17]. The bully-SV pathway begins during early adolescence,
as the content of bullying becomes more sexualized and cross-

61

sex peer interactions become more frequent. We hypothesize
that bullying perpetration would be signiﬁcantly associated with
SV perpetration over time. This study represents the ﬁrst step in
building empirical support for the bully-SV pathway theory.
Methods
Participants
In spring and fall 2008, students completed a survey designed
to collect information about their attitudes and experiences at
school as part of a project being funded by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention. The participants included 1391 students
from four Midwestern middle schools (grades, 5– 8). The sample
included 49.8% females, and students ranged in age from 10 to 15
years (mean ⫽ 13.9; standard deviation ⫽ 1.05); 59% (n ⫽ 820)
identiﬁed as African American and 41% identiﬁed as Caucasian
(n ⫽ 571). Students were administered self-report surveys during
free periods or health/gym classes during a 40-minute session, with
groups of students ranging in size from 20 to 25 students; the
students were given a highlighter and pencil as a token of appreciation.
Consent/assent procedures
Institutional review board approval to use a waiver of active
consent was obtained from the University of Illinois, and a certiﬁcate of conﬁdentiality was granted by Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention. Parents were asked to sign and return
the parent information letter only if they preferred that their
child not participate in the study. Before data collection, investigators attended parent–teacher conference meetings and staff
meetings, and the study was announced in school newsletters
and via e-mails to parents. Parents were provided with consent
forms for their child’s participation, and assent was obtained
from students at each wave of data collection. An informational
packet was sent by mail and e-mail to parents of students in the
ﬁve middle schools.
Multiple safeguards were implemented to prevent students
from becoming upset by the content of the surveys. First, an
assent script was read to students that emphasized that completing the task was voluntary because they could skip any question
or stop participating at any point. After this script was read,
students indicated their assent by signing their name on the
survey coversheet. Second, an appropriately trained doctorallevel psychology student was present at every survey administration to provide immediate support for a student, if necessary,
and direct him/her to appropriate resources. Third, students
were given a card with researcher contact information in case
more information about the study or a referral was needed.
Multiple self-help resource numbers were included on the card.
Fourth, students were reminded verbally about school-based
resources available (e.g., guidance counselors) in the beginning
and end of survey administration.
Survey measures
SV perpetration. A modiﬁed version of the American Association
of University Women (AAUW) sexual harassment survey [18]
was used to measure the frequency with which students perpetrated SV behaviors in the past year. Response options included
Not sure, Never, Rarely, Sometimes, and Often. The AAUW scale

was subjected to an exploratory factor analysis using principal
axis factoring, and a two-factor solution was indicated through
the scree test, Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy (.72), and Bartlett’s test of sphericity (␹2 ⫽ 2209.40, df ⫽
105, p ⬍ .001). In the two-factor rotated solution, factor one
(sexual harassment) contained nine items (e.g., making sexual
comments, spreading rumors, and pulling at clothing of another
student), had internal consistency (␣ ⫽ .81), and accounted for
23.62% of the variance in the factor score (factor loadings ranging
from .39 through .79). Factor two (forced sexual contact) contained three items (i.e., forcing someone to kiss you, forcing
someone to do something sexual besides kissing, and forcing
someone to touch your private parts), demonstrated internal
consistency (␣ ⫽ .73), and accounted for 6.05% of the variance in
the factor score (with factor loadings ranging from .66 through

with peer nominations of bullying [4] and demonstrated internal
consistency (␣ ⫽ .86) in this study.

Homophobic teasing. The ﬁve-item agent scale of the Homophobic Content Agent Target scale [19] assessed homophobic teasing
perpetration epithets during the previous 30 days. Students read
the following sentence: Some kids call each other names homo,
gay, lesbo, fag, or dyke. “How many times in the last 30 days did YOU
say these words to . . .,” and then were asked how often they said
these words to a friend, someone you did not like, someone you
did not know well, someone you thought was gay, and someone
you did not think was gay. Response options include Never, 1 or 2
times, 3 or 4 times, 5 or 6 times, or 7 or more times. Evidence for the
scale’s construct validity was found through it being a distinct
scale in factor analyses, and convergence and divergence validity with similar and dissimilar scales [19]. Higher scores
indicate more homophobic teasing, and the scale demonstrated internal consistency (␣ ⫽ .80).

Results

Bullying perpetration. The nine-item Illinois Bully Scale [20] assessed the frequency of teasing, name-calling, social exclusion,
and rumor spreading. Students were asked how often in the past
30 days they had teased other students, upset other students for
the fun of it, excluded others from their group of friends, helped
harass other students, and so forth. Response options include
Never, 1 or 2 times, 3 or 4 times, 5 or 6 times, or 7 or more times.
Higher scores indicate greater bullying perpetration. The construct validity of this scale has been supported via exploratory
and conﬁrmatory factor analyses, which has been previously
published [20]. Also, scale scores have been strongly correlated

Data analysis plan
Only 2% to 3% of items at wave 1 and 3% to 4% of items at wave
2 were missing. A multiple imputation procedure was used to
preserve the integrity of each group of respondents and create a
parsimonious dataset [21]. Multivariate analyses of variance
were then conducted to test differences in scale scores across
gender and race. Correlational analyses were examined to determine the extent to which bullying perpetration and SV perpetration were associated with age, and the extent to which the
associations between bullying and SV perpetration differed
across gender and race. Two separate regression analyses were
run to test the hypothesis that bullying perpetration and homophobic teasing are associated with SV perpetration.

Prevalence of bullying, homophobic teasing, and SV perpetration
subtypes by gender. Prevalence of bullying perpetration and homophobic teasing was calculated as the number of students
whose scale scores were one standard deviation above the mean.
Using this as a cutoff, 12% of males and 12% of females could be
considered bully perpetrators. In addition, 20% of females and
34% of males reported homophobic teasing others. Given the
dearth of literature on SV perpetration among middle school
students, prevalence data are presented for selected items to
inform future conceptualizations of SV. In relation to the sexual
harassment perpetration scale, 34% of the boys (28% of girls)
reported making sexual comments to other students in the past
year, 5% of boys (7% of girls) spread a sexual rumor, and 4% of
boys (2% of girls) pulled at someone’s clothing. Forced sexual
contact in the form of touching someone’s private parts was
reported by 1% of boys and a negligible number of girls. On the
homophobic content-agent scale, 26% of boys (24% of girls) reported homophobic teasing directed at a friend.
Gender and race differences on study scales. Gender and race
differences on scale measures were examined to determine
whether analyses needed to be conducted separately for these
groups. It was hypothesized that males would display more SV
perpetration and homophobic teasing than females, but no gender differences would emerge for bullying perpetration. We hy-

pothesized that African American and Caucasian students would
be similar in self-reports of SV, homophobic teasing, and bullying
perpetration. Multivariate analyses of variance were conducted
to test these hypotheses, with gender and race as the independent variables, and the following as dependent variables: (a)
sexual harassment perpetration at waves 1 and 2; (b) forced
sexual contact perpetration waves 1 and 2; (c) bullying perpetration wave 1; and (d) homophobic teasing toward others wave 1.
Given the large sample size, only signiﬁcant differences with
effect sizes greater than .03 (␩2) were interpreted.
For the set of dependent variables, there was a signiﬁcant
main effect for gender (Wilks ␭ ⫽ .99, p ⬍ .01, ␩2 ⫽ .01); however,
the effect size was too low to interpret as relevant. However, a
signiﬁcant race main effect was found (Wilks ␭ ⫽ .96, p ⬍ .001,
␩2 ⫽ .04), but the interaction for gender and race did not reach
signiﬁcance (Wilks ␭ ⫽ .99, p ⬎ .05, ␩2 ⫽ .01). Follow-up univariate analyses of variance are presented in Table 2 and indicated
that African American students reported greater levels of bullying perpetration at wave 1 than white students (p ⬍ .001, ␩2 ⫽
.04), although this effect size of .04 suggested that race explained
only 4% of the differences in bullying perpetration. As hypothesized, African American and Caucasian students were similar on
their reports of SV perpetration and homophobic teasing perpetration. In Table 3, correlations between age and the study measures indicate that bullying perpetration and SV perpetration did
not signiﬁcantly relate to age.
Correlations. Table 3 provides correlations among study variables for males and females separately. Overall, the patterns
among the correlations were similar among males and females.
Of particular interest was the signiﬁcant correlation between

bullying perpetration and sexual harassment perpetration
within wave 1 (males: r ⫽ .40, females: r ⫽ .39), but these associations were lower for bullying perpetration at wave 1, with
sexual harassment perpetration at wave 2 (males: r ⫽ .24, females: r ⫽ .21). Homophobic teasing directed toward others and
bullying perpetration were signiﬁcantly correlated at wave
1 (males: r ⫽ .56, females: r ⫽ .55). However, bullying perpetration at wave 1 was not associated with forced sexual contact
perpetration at waves 1 or 2 for males and females (males: rs ⫽
.03, .01; females: rs ⫽ .07). These associations did not differ when
the correlations were calculated for African American and white
students separately.
Multivariate associations. Two regression analyses were computed to examine the hypotheses further at the multivariate
level and to determine the degree to which bullying and homophobic teasing toward others at wave 1 predicted SV at wave
2, adjusting for age, gender, race, and wave 1 SV rates (Table 4).
For both analyses, bullying perpetration, homophobic teasing,
and the two SV subtypes at wave 1 were entered as predictors.
The outcome variables were wave 2 sexual harassment perpetration and wave 2 forced sexual contact perpetration.
In the ﬁrst model predicting sexual harassment perpetration
at wave 2, the overall model was signiﬁcant (F ⫽ 15.64; p ⬍ .001;
R2 ⫽ .06; Table 4). The strongest predictor of sexual harassment
perpetration at wave 2 was bullying perpetration at wave 1, even
after controlling for sexual harassment perpetration at wave 1
(␤ ⫽ .15); greater bullying perpetration at wave 1 was associated
with greater sexual harassment perpetration at wave 2. The
second and third strongest predictors were sexual harassment
perpetration at wave 1 and homophobic teasing toward others at

wave 1 (␤s ⫽ .08). Gender and race were not signiﬁcant predictors in the model. Two-way interactions for gender and race with
other predictors were not signiﬁcant, indicating that this model
seems to hold for males and females, and black and white students. These models yielded the same results as the model with
all students.
A similar model was run with forced sexual contact at wave 2
as the outcome. This model was nonsigniﬁcant (F ⫽ 1.36; p ⬎
.005; R2 ⫽ .01; Table 4).
Discussion
This study found support for the hypothesized bully-SV pathway theory. Similar to the previous studies [11–14], bullying
during wave 1 signiﬁcantly predicted sexual harassment at wave
2. These ﬁndings suggest that a pathway may exist starting in
early middle school, where traditional bullying perpetration
transforms into more gendered harassment and aggressive behavior in the form of homophobic teasing and sexual harassment. We suspect that, according to the bully-SV pathway, as
adolescents who perpetrate traditional bullying mature, they
increase their use of homophobic epithets. We hypothesized that
as these bullies engage in more interactions with oppositegender peers, they are more likely to perpetrate SV. The current
study is suggestive of this because it conﬁrms a strong association between bullying perpetration and subsequent sexual harassment perpetration for both boys and girls, and conﬁrms that
homophobic teasing is also correlated with co-occurring bullying perpetration and later sexual harassment perpetration. In
addition, more similarities were found between African American and Caucasian students than differences, and the bully-SV
pathway was signiﬁcant after controlling for race.
A secondary, yet still important goal of this article was to
determine what subtypes of SV are perpetrated among middle
school students, a population in which SV has not been investigated fully. Results of factor analysis supported a two-factor
solution of SV perpetration—sexual harassment and forced sexual contact. As studies continue to examine the precursors of SV
in later adolescence, use of these different subtypes of SV will be
helpful.
Some recent discussion has emerged in the literature about
whether the behaviors that are assessed by the AAUW scale [18]
are measuring sexual harassment or simply assessing “potentially offensive sexual behavior,” given the limited ability to
determine whether the perpetration/victimization elicited neg-

ative reactions [22]. Some have argued that young adolescents
might express their sexual attraction toward their same-age
peers through sexual teasing or in other inappropriate ways [23].
We do agree that the intentions of the perpetrator of SV might
not be malicious in all cases; however, given the dearth of literature with this population, we believe it is premature to dismiss
this perpetration and simply call it “offensive behavior.” It is
important to note that homophobic teasing and sexual comments may be simply “offensive behavior” to some but may have
wider ranging consequences for others (e.g., lesbian and gay
students) if they create an unsafe school climate. We encourage
scholars to continue to assess these SV perpetration behaviors.
Although we were somewhat surprised by ﬁndings that the
prevalence of SV perpetration among this sample did not vary
greatly overall by gender, and the bully/SV pathway model was
not more predictive for males than females, we suspect this is
explained by the age of the sample (10 –15 years; average, 13.9
years) and the types of SV that are encompassed in the sexual
harassment factor, the only signiﬁcant outcome. What is clear
from our results, as captured in the sexual harassment outcome,
is the overwhelming prevalence of verbally based SV perpetration among this young adolescent sample. Boys and girls reported making sexual comments and calling other students gay
and/or lesbian at rates of 28%–39%, with boys reporting slightly
higher perpetration rates. These types of less severe SV may be
more typical for young adolescents to perpetrate, but we speculate that as we follow these boys and girls through high school,
we will see the gender gap widen, with boys reporting higher
rates of perpetration, particularly on the items that comprise the
forced sexual contact factor, including rape perpetration (“forced
them to do something sexual other than kissing”). Although
reporting for the three items comprising the forced sexual contact scale was extremely low in the current sample, we suspect
this will increase for males as they age, based on previous studies
showing that males are more likely than females to perpetrate
these more severe types of SV and that SV perpetration is occurring in late adolescence and early adulthood [24,25]. This hypothesis also relates to homophobic teasing and is supported by
recent studies that have indicated that homophobic perpetration
is associated with hypermasculinity and heterosexist attitudes
[26].
An important next step is to further elucidate this proposed
model and to understand the role of homophobic teasing in the
relationship between bullying perpetration and SV perpetration.
Future studies should consider the gender of the perpetrator and

the victim. For example, male bullies who perpetrate against
female victims may be more likely to go on to perpetrate SV
against girls. Qualitative work with youth would also be useful to
disentangle the meanings of and connections among SV, bullying, and homophobic teasing. Finally, additional research with
diverse samples is needed to test and replicate the proposed
model. This study represents a ﬁrst step in understanding the
empirical links among bullying, homophobic teasing, and some
forms of SV perpetration among a sample of young adolescents.
