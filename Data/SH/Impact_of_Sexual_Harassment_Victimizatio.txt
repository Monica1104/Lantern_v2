Abstract

Purpose: To examine gender differences in prevalence and types of sexual harassment victimization
experienced in grade 9 and how it contributes to relationship victimization and psychological adjustment 2.5 years later.
Methods: A total of 1734 students from 23 schools completed self-report surveys at entry to grade 9
and end of grade 11. Self-report data were collected on victimization experiences (sexual harassment,
physical dating violence, peer violence, and relational victimization) and adjustment (emotional
distress, problem substance use, self-harm, suicidal thoughts, maladaptive dieting, feeling unsafe at
school, and perpetration of violent delinquency). Separate analyses by sex were prespecified.
Results: Sexual harassment victimization was common among boys (42.4%) and girls (44.1%) in
grade 9, with girls reporting more sexual jokes, comments, and unwanted touch than among boys,
and with boys reporting more homosexual slurs or receiving unwanted sexual content. For girls, sexual
harassment victimization in grade 9 was associated with elevated risk of self-harm, suicidal thoughts,
maladaptive dieting, early dating, substance use, and feeling unsafe at school. A similar pattern of risk
was found for boys, with the exception of dieting and self-harm behaviors. Adjusted odds ratios (AOR)
indicated these students were significantly more likely than nonharassed students to report victimization by peers and dating partners 2.5 years later (AOR for boys and girls, respectively; all p < .01),
including sexual harassment (AOR: 2.45; 2.9), physical dating violence (AOR: 2.02; 3.73), and physical peer violence (AOR: 2.75; 2.79). Gr 9 sexual harassment also contributed significantly to
emotional distress (AOR: 2.09; 2.24), problem substance use (AOR: 1.79; 2.04), and violent delinquency perpetration (AOR: 2.1; 3.34) 2.5 years later (boys and girls, respectively; all p < .01).
Conclusions: Sexual harassment at the beginning of high school is a strong predictor of future victimization by peers and dating partners for both girls and boys, and warrants greater prevention and intervention efforts. Ó 2009 Society for Adolescent Medicine. All rights reserved.

among youth encompasses acts that are sufficiently severe,
persistent, or pervasive to limit a student’s ability to participate in or benefit from an education program or activity, or
that create a hostile or abusive educational environment
[2]. Such harassment can take physical forms such as a pulling at clothing, rubbing up against another person, or grabbing/pinching, as well as verbal forms such as sexual
comments, jeers, rumor spreading, or sexual jokes.

Sexual harassment has been recognized for many years as
being a problem in the workplace, university campuses, and
military settings, where studies show that about two in five
women and one in six men report at least one incident in
the past 2 years [3]. Although sexual harassment is gender
based by nature, women experience it differently from
men. Women are more likely to report being objectified,
put down, or treated differently because of their gender [4],
whereas men experience vulgar and homophobic comments,
presumably to enforce traditional gender role stereotypes [1].
Most students also experience some forms of sexual harassment during high school, either occasionally (59%) or often
(27%), with girls experiencing more frequent and severe
forms than boys [5,6]. Even when the timeframe of questions
about unwanted sexual behaviors and harassment is narrowed from ‘‘ever’’ (i.e., lifetime prevalence) to the past 2
weeks, 15% of high school students report being subjected
to unwanted and personally upsetting sexual harassment [7].
Despite awareness of the frequency of sexual harassment,
there is little available research on the forms of harassment
experienced by adolescent boys and girls or how it may affect
them differently over time. Although an atmosphere of sexual
harassment is unhealthy and alienating, further study is
needed to determine the effects of such acts on girls’ and
boys’ interpersonal adjustment, especially over time. In the
only longitudinal study of this issue, sexual harassment
among grade 8 students predicted adjustment problems 3
years later [8]. Younger girls and boys who associated with
deviant peers were more likely to be the victims of sexual
harassment. Moreover, girls who reached pubertal development earlier were at increased risk for sexual harassment,
most likely because of inappropriate attention by others. Of
particular concern was the finding that girls who reported
higher victimization in the eighth grade also had increased
problems with substance use, lower self-esteem, and symptoms of depression 3 years later. These findings suggest
that, similar to findings with adults, sexual harassment is
a risk factor for psychological problems among youth.
Students’ experiences of abuse by peers in high school
have a significant influence on their antisocial behavior and
psychological adjustment [9,10]. Because victimization is
highly stable, many of the same youth experience ongoing
abuse from peers that contributes to their further mistreatment and adjustment problems, which may be especially relevant for boys who do not fit the rigid and conventional notion
of masculinity [11,12]. Therefore, we conducted the present
study of sexual harassment beginning in grade 9 (the first
year of high school for this sample), because this is a time
when many students are subjected to verbal and physical
taunts and aggression from both their own classmates and
older students. As they attempt to navigate entry into peer
groups, many are faced with decisions and conflicts that
pose a risk to their emotional well-being and are bombarded
with negative gender-based messages [13]. We considered
sexual harassment as a developmental risk factor, and anticipated that it could interfere with social adjustment and

247

emotional well-being and lead to further victimization in
peer and dating relationships. Our primary objectives were
to document the types and prevalence of sexual harassment
experienced by boys and girls, and the negative outcomes
associated with such experiences in the short and longer
term. Given the gendered context of sexual harassment and
that girls report more harassment and related distress than
boys, we examined the short- and longer-term risks and
outcomes separately for boys and girls.
Methods
Study participants and design
Students (N ¼ 1897) from 23 high schools participated in
this study, which was approved by the Institutional Review
Boards at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health and
the University of Western Ontario. Data were collected as
part of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a school-based
intervention program to reduce adolescent dating violence
and related risk behaviors. Sexual harassment victimization
was assessed at the beginning of grade 9 and again 2.5 years
later at the end of grade 11, along with other self-reported
behaviors described below.
Demographic information was collected from the parents
of participating students with a take home questionnaire in
grade 9 (return rate ¼ 65%, n ¼ 1225). The majority of
participants’ parents were Caucasian (89%), married (82%),
employed (86%), and had some post-secondary education
(73%). However, a low return of this survey does not make
these data representative of our sample in general. Indeed,
the students in this study were much more diverse in ethnicity
and family status.
Measures
Sexual harassment victimization. Sexual harassment was
assessed using a modified version of the AAUW Sexual
Harassment Survey of unwanted verbal and physical forms
of sexual attention or harassment [5]. The original survey
was modified to ask specifically if another teen or classmate
had done any of the unwanted acts to him or her in the past 3
months at school, using a dichotomous (yes/no) response
scale. Six behaviors of the original 14 were removed based
on low relevance or low frequency within high school
samples [1,5]. Items included verbal, nonverbal, and physical
forms of harassment, shown in Table 1. Because the total
item distribution was positively skewed, sexual harassment
victimization was dichotomized into absent (no or one experience) or present (two or more experiences).
Physical dating violence and peer violence. Physical dating
violence victimization was assessed with four items from the
Conflict in Adolescent Relationships Inventory (CADRI),
a self-report measure with established convergent/divergent
validity [14]. Students indicated (yes or no) to behaviors
they had experienced in the past year from a boyfriend/

girlfriend ‘‘while you were having an argument, angry at one
another, or having a fight.’’ Presence of physical abuse was
based on endorsement of one or more times (e.g., ‘‘he
pushed, shoved, or shook me’’). Physical peer violence
victimization was assessed with one item (yes/no) that asked
students whether they had been hit, slapped, or punched by
a peer with the intention of harm in the past 3 months. Youth
also completed a delinquent behavior inventory developed
by the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth
[15]. Eight items were chosen to reflect engagement in
violent delinquency (e.g., ‘‘fought with someone to the point
where they needed care for their injuries’’). Presence of
violent delinquency perpetration (i.e., two or more forms of
violent delinquency) was based on prior established cutoffs [16]. Peer relational victimization was assessed with
five items from the Self-Report of Aggression and Social
Behaviors survey [17]. Students indicated (1 ¼ not at all
true; 5 ¼ very true) the extent to which they experienced
some form of rumour/gossip spreading or social exclusion
in the past 3 months, and those who reported 4 or 5 on one
or more items were scored as positive.
Emotional distress and suicidal thought/self-harm. Twelve
items from the depression and anxiety subscales of the Brief
Symptom Inventory [18] were combined to form a measure
of emotional distress. Youth indicated (0 ¼ not at all; 4 ¼
extremely) the extent to which they experienced each
symptom over the past 7 days. Responses were dichotomized
as present or absent, and summed to form a total distress
score (a ¼.89). Students were categorized as experiencing
emotional distress if they endorsed five or more of the 12
items based on instrument norms and the current distribution
of scores. Suicidal thought was assessed with one item (yes/
no) asking students if they had considered suicide at any time
over the past 3 months. Self-harm was assessed with one item
(yes/no) asking students if they had hurt themselves on
purpose (cut yourself, burned yourself, etc.) without intending to kill themselves in the past 3 months.
Maladaptive dieting behaviors. Four items from the Youth
Risk Behavior Surveillance Survey [19] asked students if
they had engaged in any maladaptive dieting behaviors to

lose weight in the past 30 days, including the following:
purging; taking pills, powders, or liquids; fasting; and restriction of food. Maladaptive dieting was dichotomized based on
the presence of one or more dieting behaviors.
Problem substance use. Experience with alcohol and illicit
drugs was assessed with the NLSCY [19] and converted to
a dichotomous problem substance use score based on the
presence of any one of four criteria: drinking 1–2 days
a week or more; having five or more drinks at one time in
past 30 days; using marijuana 1–2 days a week or more; or
having tried any other illicit drug in the past three months.
Sexually active and early dating. Students indicated whether
they ever had consensual sexual intercourse (yes/no). Early
dating was assessed with one item, asking students how old
they were when they first started seeing (dating) someone,
and dichotomized based on starting dating at 12 years of
age or younger (i.e., presence of early dating).
Feeling unsafe at school. This variable was coded positive
for respondents who indicated they felt unsafe at school on
one or more days over the past 30 days.
Procedure
Data were collected in October 2004 (T1: grade 9) and 2.5
years later in May, 2007 (T2: grade 11). All grade 9 students
were eligible and there were no exclusion criteria. A research
assistant explained the study to each class and distributed
research information, consent/assent forms, and a demographic survey to send home to parents. During school hours,
students completed an on-line survey in the computer room
or library under supervision by research staff and teachers.
This procedure was identical at T1 and T2. Students were
assured that their responses were confidential, were assigned
a unique identifier for follow-up, and received help-seeking
information.
Data analyses
Chi-square analyses were used to identify other risks associated with sexual harassment victimization in grade 9, by

D. Chiodo et al. / Journal of Adolescent Health 45 (2009) 246–252

gender. A logistic regression model predicting sexual harassment victimization at T2 was then examined, controlling for
demographic variables, baseline scores, and grade 9 intervention status based on the associated RCT. Grade 9 intervention
status was included in the model to control for any effects the
associated prevention program may have had on any of the
outcomes in this study. This model was repeated for related
T2 outcomes of relationship victimization and psychological
adjustment. Given the gendered-nature of sexual harassment
victimization, separate logistic regression analyses were conducted for boys and girls. Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) and
95% confidence intervals (CI) are reported for all analyses,
with type I error rate set at p < .01.

thoughts, self harm, maladaptive dieting, early dating,
substance use, and school safety). Significant odds ratios
(ORs) ranged from 2.03 (CI: 1.57–2.65) for maladaptive
dieting, to 5.88 (CI: 2.52–13.72) and 5.03(CI: 3.5–7.21) for
self-harm and suicidal thoughts, respectively, indicating
a two- to almost sixfold increase of such risk factors among
girls experiencing sexual harassment. With the exception of
dieting and self-harm behaviors a similar pattern of risk
was found for boys, with substance use and suicidal thoughts
being the highest risk factors (OR 2.94, CI: 2.23–3.89 and
2.75, CI: 1.64–4.6, respectively). In all cases, the magnitude
of the impact was smaller for boys than girls.

Results
The parent consent–youth assent rate was 75%, with
a combined return rate (yes or no) of 82%. Longitudinal analyses included only students who provided data at both waves
(1734/1897; retention rate 92%; 51% female). Of the 334
students who had changed schools at T2, 186 were located
and completed the on-line survey at their new school. The
remaining students lost to follow-up refused to participate
(n ¼ 29) or could not be located (n ¼ 119). The subsample
of students lost to follow-up did not differ from the full
sample on baseline measures.
Risk factors associated with sexual harassment in grade 9
A sizable number of students (n ¼ 790/1822; 43%) was
classified as experiencing sexual harassment in grade 9.
Although rates were the same for girls (44.1%) and boys
(42.4%), types of harassment experiences differed (Table
1). Girls were more likely than boys to experience being
the recipient of sexual jokes, comments, and unwanted touch,
while boys were more likely to be subjected to homosexual
slurs or given sexual pictures and notes. Boys and girls
reported similar rates of being brushed against in a sexual
way, being the victim of rumors, and having their clothing
pulled in a sexual way.
Sexual harassment victimization was associated with
several significant risk factors at T1. Notably, for girls, sexual
harassment victimization was associated with elevated risk of
all study outcomes, as shown in Table 2 (i.e., suicidal

Boys and girls who reported sexual harassment victimization in grade 9 were 2.5 to 3 three times as likely to report it
again 2.5 years later, supporting the view that such experiences tend to continue (boys: AOR: 2.45, CI: 1.8–3.32; girls:
AOR: 2.9, CI: 2.25–3.42) (Table 3). Table 3 also indicates
that sexual harassment in grade 9 was associated with higher
risk for other forms of relationship violence in grade 11. For
boys, sexual harassment victimization at T1 was associated
with higher risk of physical dating violence victimization
(AOR: 2.02 CI: 1.19-3.48), physical peer violence victimization (AOR: 2.75, CI: 1.59–4.76), and peer relational victimization (AOR: 1.49, CI: 1.09–2.02) at T2. A comparable
pattern for girls was found, with the exception of peer relational victimization: (AOR: 3.73, CI: 2.27–6.61; 2.79,
CI: 1.61–4.82; for physical dating violence and physical
peer violence, respectively).
Finally, sexual harassment at T1 contributed to risk for
several other problem outcomes 2.5 years later, over and
above the continuity associated with these problems (i.e.,
controlling for T1 functioning). For girls and boys, emotional
distress, problem substance use and violent delinquency
perpetration were all significantly predicted by T1 sexual
harassment victimization (Table 3). For boys, sexual harassment victimization at T1 was associated with an elevated risk
at T2 for emotional distress (AOR: 2.09 CI: 1.46–3.0),
problem substance use (AOR: 1.79 CI: 1.29–2.48), and
violent delinquency perpetration (AOR: 2.1 CI: 1.39–3.16).
A similar pattern was found for girls: emotional distress

Discussion
Sexual harassment victimization is prevalent among youth
entering high school, occurring at equivalent rates for girls
(44%) and boys (43%) in the present study. However, the
nature of sexual harassment victimization differed for boys
and girls, with girls experiencing more unwanted comments,
gestures, and touch, and boys experienced more homosexual
slurs and being shown or given unwanted sexual pictures,
photos, messages, or notes. At the same time, the overlap
across items should not be discounted, as significant numbers
of both boys and girls reported each type of harassment.
This research extends previous work on sexual harassment
in a number of ways. First, it documents the negative impact
for both boys and girls. Historically, sexual harassment victimization has been viewed as a form of violence experienced
primarily by girls, with significantly more negative outcomes
for girls than boys [8]. Although our results indicate that the
immediate impact and longer-term outcomes associated with
sexual harassment victimization are often stronger and more
negative for girls, the experience of sexual harassment victimization for boys should not be overlooked. Sexual harassment
experienced by boys was also associated with risk for virtually
all outcomes assessed in this study, with the exception of
unhealthy dieting and self-harm. In addition, our findings point
to the importance of studying sexual harassment victimization
over time. Sexual harassment victimization at the start of high
school was associated with elevated risk, in terms of other
forms of victimization and psychological adjustment difficulties 2.5 years later. These results add substantially to our
knowledge about the longer-term impact and effects of sexual
harassment victimization in an adolescent sample.
With previous studies reporting rates of sexual harassment
victimization as high as 80% (depending on the timeframe),
some authors have suggested that such interactions between
teens in schools are an accepted (if not welcomed) component
of adolescent lives [20]. Nonetheless, results from this study

and others strongly suggest that boys and girls are distressed
by gender-based harassment. The presence of sexual harassment victimization in this study was associated with a range
of risks for both boys and girls. For girls, an elevated risk of
all outcomes under study (i.e., suicidal thoughts, self-harm,
maladaptive dieting, early dating, substance use, and school
safety) was associated with sexual harassment victimization.
Consistent with previous research demonstrating that adolescent girls who experience repeated sexual harassment are
more likely to attempt suicide [21], our findings show that
the impact of sexual harassment victimization in girls is severe,
and was reflected in odds ratios as high as 5.88 for self-harm
(e.g., cutting behaviors) and 5.03 for suicidal thoughts. When
sexual harassment frequently occurs in adolescent girls’ lives,
they may be at risk for dysfunctional and abusive relationships
in adulthood, in part because they come to expect demeaning
behaviors as normal in heterosexual relationships [22,23].
Although most research on sexual harassment
victimization among youth attempts to describe the impact
cross-sectionally, this study contributes to a more precise
knowledge of the long-term impact of sexual harassment
victimization by studying the issue longitudinally. We found
that sexual harassment victimization in grade 9 was associated with higher risk for other forms of relationship violence,
such as physical peer violence and sexual harassment victimization at grade 11 for both boys and girls, and dating
violence and peer relational aggression for boys. These findings indicate additive risk for these outcomes as the analyses
controlled for prior victimization experiences. Moreover,
sexual harassment victimization in grade 9 contributed to
risk for emotional distress, substance use, and violent delinquency 2.5 years later, over and above the continuity associated with these problems. It may not be enough to ensure that
sexual harassment stops; additional supports may be required
to reduce the impact over time.
The longitudinal pattern was similar for boys and girls in
that emotional distress, problem substance use and violent
delinquency perpetration were all significantly predicted by
grade 9 sexual harassment victimization, with adjusted odds
ratios ranging from 1.79 (problem substance use for boys)
to 3.34 (violent delinquency perpetration for girls). The

violent delinquency finding is noteworthy, given that most
studies tend to focus on internalizing and substance-related
outcomes. This finding suggests that girls who experience
sexual harassment are not simply distressed but over time
may also act out in a highly aggressive manner. Sexual harassment victimization, however, did not predict peer relational
victimization for girls 2.5 years later. Although girls in the
present sample did report more peer relational victimization
at both time points than did boys (not presented here), peer
relational victimization was not significantly predicted by
T1 sexual harassment victimization. The literature on sexual
harassment victimization shows that girls are often victimized
by boys, whereas boys who experience sexual harassment are
also victimized by boys (e.g., homosexual/homophobic
slurs). Peer relational victimization is often same-sex peers
spreading rumors, exclusion, and other similar behaviors, so
it may not be predicted for girls by earlier accounts of sexual
harassment likely committed by boys.
Study limitations
Despite the methodological strengths of the present study,
a few important limitations should be noted. The dichotomization of sexual harassment victimization does not capture
the severity, chronicity, or subjective impact of such experiences. Although there was overlap in types of behaviors
experienced by boys and girls, it is difficult to know whether
a particular behavior is experienced in the same way (e.g.,
whether being grabbed in a sexual manner is experienced
the same by boys and girls). Other researchers have found
that girls perceive these types of harassing experiences as
more harmful and upsetting than do boys [24] and receive
‘‘qualitatively more severe, physically intrusive, and intimidating forms of harassment’’ [26]. Given the context of
gender role socialization that occurs in high school and the
developmental stage of high school students, gender differences in how sexual harassment is experienced and how it
affects adjustment are not surprising. Similarly, sexual
minority youth, those from minority ethnic groups, or those
with child maltreatment backgrounds might experience
higher rates or different forms of sexual harassment as well
as more adverse effects because of heightened vulnerability
[2]. It may be possible that youth who have had earlier experiences of child abuse or sexual harassment may have had
more negative outcomes than youth who first experience
sexual harassment victimization in grade 9, factors not
controlled for in this study. Future research in this area would
benefit from a greater understanding of the mediators or
mechanisms through which sexual harassment influences
relationship victimization and psychological adjustment for
both boys and girls more than 2 years later.
Conclusions
During the past several years, schools and organizations
have conducted significant work on the issue of sexual

251

harassment, establishing schoolwide policies making it clear
that sexual harassment is illegal and unacceptable behavior.
The development of effective policies and prevention strategies should be a high priority for all school districts. The
delivery of school-based programs that build healthy, positive relationships among children and youth and that create
a school climate that supports gender equality and other
forms of diversity can be effective prevention strategies
[25]. Moreover, the importance of professional development
training opportunities for educators to challenge the view that
sexual harassment is simply ‘‘boys being boys’’ needs to be
addressed. Although many of these behaviors are not as
visible or extreme as other forms of violence, this study
shows that these acts of ‘‘everyday violence’’ are likely to
have significant impact on the lives of youth and have the
potential to cause physical and psychological harm
throughout their high school years. Strategies to educate
youth about the nature and harm of sexual harassment and
