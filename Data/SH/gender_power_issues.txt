VIOLENCE / June 1999
This article describes the roles of gender, power, and relationship in peer sexual harassment for
342 urban high school students. Overall, 87% of girls and 79% of boys report experiencing peer
sexual harassment, whereas 77% of girls and 72% of boys report sexually harassing their
peers during the school year. Girls experience the more overtly sexual forms of harassment
more often than boys and boys perpetrate sexual harassing behaviors more often than girls.
Hypotheses of a relationship between power, gender, and the perpetration of peer sexual harassment are supported.

Although peer sexual harassment is the focus of increasing research and
intervention in the workplace and on college campuses, less attention has
been paid to peer sexual harassment in secondary schools. One possible reason for this relative lack of attention is the belief that sexual harassment is
normative for teens; it is even an expected element of adolescent behavior.
Indeed, sexual harassment appears to be the norm. Stein’s (1981) seminal
survey of three high school student councils and a vocational high school
reported peer sexual harassment to be prevalent in their schools. From a sample of 71 students, 57 (80%) reported experiencing sexual harassment at
school and 34 stated that they were sexually harassed by a peer. An American
Association of University Women (AAUW) survey of 1,600 students, grades
8 through 11, found that 87% of the girls and 71% of the boys were sexually
harassed by peers at school (AAUW, 1993). Peer sexual harassment may
include unwanted or unwelcome behaviors, such as making sexual comments, jokes, gestures, or looks; showing sexual pictures, photographs, illustrations, messages, or notes; writing sexual messages or graffiti on bathroom
walls or locker rooms; spreading sexual rumors; calling someone gay or lesbian in a malicious manner; spying on someone dressing or showering at

school; flashing or mooning someone; touching, grabbing, or pinching in a
sexual way; pulling at clothing in a sexual way; intentionally brushing
against someone in a sexual way; pulling clothing off or down; blocking or
cornering in a sexual way; and forcing a kiss or forcing other unwelcome sexual behavior other than kissing (AAUW, 1993). Sexual harassment may also
include “spiking” or pulling down someone’s pants, “snuggies” or pulling
underwear up at the waist so it goes in between the buttocks, and being listed
in “slam books,” which identify student’s names and have derogatory sexual
comments written about them by other students (Strauss & Espeland, 1992).
In 1986, the United States Supreme Court described two categories of sexual harassment: quid pro quo and hostile environment (U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission [EEOC], 1993). Quid pro quo applies when a
person in a power position (e.g., a supervisor or teacher) makes decisions that
affect an employee’s job or a student’s grade based on whether the employee
or student complies with his or her sexual demands. Hostile environment
applies when the harassing behavior of anyone in the workplace (i.e., not only
a supervisor or teacher) causes the workplace to become hostile, intimidating, or offensive and unreasonably interferes with an employee’s or student’s
work.
It is the hostile environment definition that addresses peer sexual harassment. The Office of Civil Rights (OCR) reiterated the above definitions in the
March 13, 1997, release of their report Guidance in the Federal Register.
Their definition written expressly for schools defines hostile environment as
follows:
Hostile environment harassment, which includes unwelcome sexual advances,
requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, nonverbal, or physical conduct of a
sexual nature by an employee, by another student, or by a third party, is behavior that is sufficiently severe, persistent, or pervasive to limit a student’s ability
to participate in or benefit from an education program or activity, or to create a
hostile or abusive educational environment. (Department of Education, 1997,
p. 12038).

It is also important to note that definitions of peer sexual harassment overlap with criminal definitions of sexual assault, as some of the sexual harassment items such as touching, grabbing, or pinching in a sexual way; pulling
clothing off or down; forcing a kiss; or forcing other unwelcome sexual
behavior, such as rape, make clear.
The belief that sexual harassment of high school peers is an aspect of normal adolescent behavior ignores not only the criminal aspects of sexual harassment but the effects of such harassment on victims. Researchers have
found that students who are sexually harassed by their peers experience

numerous school performance difficulties, including absenteeism, decreased
quality of schoolwork, skipping or dropping classes, lower grades, loss of
friends, tardiness, and truancy (AAUW, 1993; Permanent Commission on the
Status of Women [PCSW], 1995; Stein, Marshall, & Tropp, 1993; Strauss &
Espeland, 1992). Students also report mental health symptoms that include
loss of appetite; loss of interest in their usual activities; nightmares or disturbed sleep; feelings of isolation from friends and family; and feeling sad,
nervous, or angry (AAUW, 1993; PCSW, 1995; Stein, Marshall, & Tropp,
1993; Strauss & Espeland, 1992).
Gender. Gender is a key explanatory variable in studies of adult sexual
harassment. The incidence of men experiencing sexual harassment ranges
from 2% to 15% in the workplace (Fitzgerald et al., 1988; U.S. Merit Systems
Protection Board [USMSPB], 1981, 1987) and from 2% to 5% in universities
(Fitzgerald et al., 1988; Kottke, 1981; Metha & Nigg, 1983; Reilly, Lott, &
Gallogly, 1986). In contrast, Fitzgerald, Hulin, and Drasgow (1993) estimate
that approximately 50% of women in the workforce have been sexually harassed and that women are the primary victims and men the primary instigators of sexual harassment (Fitzgerald, 1991; Gutek, 1985; Langelan, 1993;
Pryor, La Vite, & Stoller, 1993; USMSPB, 1987). Fitzgerald et al. (1988) surveyed nearly 2,000 women at two major state universities and found that almost half of them reported experiencing some form of sexually harassing behavior. Most recently, the Department of Defense released its 1995 survey of
military personnel, which found that 55% of women and 14% of men reported experiencing sexual harassment (Department of Defense, 1996).
Power. Power, and power differential, are key dynamics in adult sexual
harassment (Langelan, 1993; MacKinnon, 1979). However, power was not
examined in the majority of studies focusing on school sexual harassment
(AAUW, 1993; PCSW, 1995; Stein, 1981; Stein et al., 1993; Strauss & Espeland, 1992; Strouse, Goodwin, & Roscoe, 1994). The likely reason for the
omission of power as an explanatory variable in studies of teen peer sexual
harassment is the apparent absence of a hierarchy in a community of peers. In
a secondary analysis of the AAUW data, Lee, Croninger, Linn, and Chen
(1996) suggested that abuse of societal power and the privileging of men over
women is reflected in teen peer sexual harassment.
Relationship. The relationship between victim and perpetrator may be an
important contextual factor. For example, we do not know if sexual harassment is more likely between peers who casually know one another as schoolmates, peers who have (or had) dating relationships, or peers who are strang-

ers. The dating violence literature suggests that 10% to 30% of high school
students experience violence in their relationships (Bergman, 1992; Foshee
et al., 1996, 1998; Gray & Foshee, 1997; Henton, Cate, Koval, Lloyd, &
Christopher, 1983; Levy, 1991; Molidor & Tolman, 1998). These figures are
similar to the dating violence rates found among college students and are
equivalent to the battering rate for adults (Cate, Henton, Koval, Christopher, &
Lloyd, 1982; Makepeace, 1981; Roscoe & Callahan, 1985). Public harassment or the harassment of women on the street appears to come primarily
from strangers (Gardner, 1995). The overlap of peer sexual harassment, dating violence, and other forms of peer violence has been largely overlooked in
their respective literatures.
In this research, we assume that sexual harassment is a prodromal form of
adult interpersonal abuse. We further assume that sexual harassment is functional, its utility being dominance and interpersonal control. Peer sexual harassment is an instrument that creates and maintains male gender hierarchy
(MacKinnon, 1979; O’Gorman & Sandler, 1988). However, we do not
assume that maintenance of male gender hierarchy is entirely the work of
men and boys; girls and women also may support male dominance. Similar to
the dating violence and adult partner violence literatures, peer sexual harassment research shows equivalent rates of victimization by gender. However,
when studying sexual harassment, dating violence, or adult partner violence,
there is a methodological survey problem that needs to be considered. Most
research on sexual harassment or dating violence identifies specific harassing or violent behaviors and inquires whether the person has experienced this
behavior. Males and females will frequently indicate that they have experienced these behaviors, and analysis may show that both experience the
behaviors equally. What this type of questioning fails to address is the chronicity and instrumental nature of the behavior, how threatened or upset a person is by experiencing this behavior, or whether there was any injury from the
behavior. These are critical questions in determining who is affected by sexual harassment or dating violence.
Further investigation of teen peer sexual harassment is needed to create a
more complete understanding of the factors and contexts that contribute to
and sustain it within the school environment. In this study, we hypothesize a
relationship between power, gender, and the experience and perpetration of
peer sexual harassment. We also hypothesize that the relationship between
perpetrator and victim is an important factor in peer sexual harassment,
including how threatened or upset the student feels by the experience of peer
sexual harassment.

METHOD

Sample and Procedure
A nonprobability sample of 342 students in a large, Midwestern, urban
high school completed a voluntary survey during a required English class.
Respondents’mean age was 16.2 years and 62% were girls; the students were
equally distributed across all 4 years of high school. The sample was racially
diverse (43% African American, 24% Latino, 14% White, 11%
Asian/Pacific, and 5% Other race or ethnicity). The sample did not differ
from the school population by gender or race.
Measures
Peer sexual harassment. We culled 12 questions from prior surveys of
peer sexual harassment (AAUW, 1993; PCSW, 1995; Stein et al., 1993;
Strauss & Espeland, 1992). The questions cover the major areas of sexual
harassment and are arranged from the least intrusive, nonphysical behaviors
to those most physically intrusive. Students estimated the frequency that they
experienced each behavior during the 1995 school year on a 5-point scale
ranging from 1 (never), 2 (once or twice), 3 (a few times per month), 4 (every
few days), to 5 (daily). In addition to examining the 12 behaviors separately,
we created an index of experienced sexual harassment (ESH) by summing
the frequencies of the 12 indicators. The internal consistency for this sexual
harassment index is marginally adequate (Cronbach’s α = 0.78).
To more fully describe the experience of sexual harassment, students indicated the gender of the person most likely to engage in each of the 12 sexual
harassment behaviors, their relationship to that person, and how threatened
or upset they felt by the harassment. Relationship choices were: unknown
schoolmate (1), known schoolmate but not in a dating relationship (2), and
schoolmate they are dating or formerly dated (3). The threat/upset variables
were rated on a 4-point ordinal scale where 1 (not at all), 2 (very little), 3
(somewhat), and 4 (very upsetting or threatening). These two items were then
summed to create a measure of Reaction to Sexual Harassment (RSH). Cronbach’s α for RSH is 0.88.
Finally, using the same 12 items and metric as in the ESH, students indicated the frequency that they used each of the 12 acts of sexual harassment
toward others. These items are summed into a Perpetration of Sexual Harassment (PSH) index. The internal consistency of the PSH is adequate (Cronbach’s α = 0.80).

Power. In this study, we focus on two dimensions of power: culturally
based power derived from beliefs about the dominance of men and personal
power experienced as confidence in one’s ability to wield influence. The Heterosexual Relationships Scale (HRS) (Hall, Howard, & Boezio, 1986) quantifies the “belief that men should dominate women, perceptions of the opposite sex as sex objects, and views that sex involves conquest” (p. 108). The
scale was developed with an adolescent sample. The HRS measures attitudes
about the legitimacy of the power of men in society to which both girls and
boys may subscribe. The HRS is self-administered and consists of 12 items
on a 4-point scale ranging from 1 (strongly agree) to 4 (strongly disagree). A
typical item in the HRS is “A guy has got to show a girl who’s boss or she’ll
end up bossing him.” In the current study, coefficient alpha for the HRS using
the 12 published items was unacceptably low at 0.45. A reliability analysis
identified five low-correlation scale items that were removed, resulting in a
marginal alpha of 0.67. The coefficient alpha in the original study (Hall et al.,
1986) was equally marginal at 0.64.
To quantify personal power, we use a subscale of the Index of Personal
Reactions (IPR) (Bennett, 1986) to measure the strength of a student’s selfconfidence or personal power. The scale is self-administered and consists of
10 items with a 5-point scale, where 1 (not at all characteristic of me) and 5
(very much characteristic of me). A typical item in the IPR is “I have a natural
talent for influencing people.” The reliability of the IPR in this study is adequate (α = 0.79).
Relationship. Although context may include many factors, the context of
peer sexual harassment in this study is the relationship between perpetrator
and victim. We would like to note that in this study, students are potentially
both perpetrator and victim. Students indicated the types of relationship between victim and perpetrator as unknown (1), known but not intimate or dating (2), and currently or formerly intimate or dating for each of the 12 sexual
harassment behaviors (3).
Gender. Students indicated their own gender, and those who experienced
or perpetrated sexual harassment indicated the gender of the perpetrator or
victim for each of the 12 items of the ESH and PSH.
Social desirability. Given the potentially controversial nature of the subject matter and possible tendency to respond in a socially desirable manner, a
12-item social desirability scale was included in our questionnaire (Greenwald & Satow, 1970).

Demographics. We asked each student to include their race and their parent’s educational level.

RESULTS

The proportion of students experiencing and perpetrating sexual harassment, along with their reactions to each of the index behaviors, is arranged in
Table 1 by gender. Overall, 84% of the students report experiencing some
sexual harassment by peers at school (87% of girls, 79% of boys), and 75%
report at least some sexual harassment of their peers (77% of girls, 72% of
boys). As Table 1 suggests, there are noticeable gender differences in the
behaviors experienced and perpetrated by students. Girls experience the
more overtly sexual forms of harassment more often than boys. Girls were
2
more likely than boys to be pressured for a date (χ = 9.04, p < .01), called
2
sexually offensive names (χ = 9.08, p < .01), cornered sexually (χ2 = 11.45, p <
.01), and pressured to do something sexual (χ2 = 3.88, p < .05).
When the focus shifts to perpetration, boys use sexual harassing behaviors
more often than girls. Boys were more likely than girls to pressure a school2
2
mate for a date (χ = 4.78, p < .05) or to do something sexual (χ = 5.16, p <
2
.05), tell sexually offensive jokes (χ = 4.37, p < .05), or spread sexual rumors
(χ2 = 6.50, p < .01). The only perpetration behavior used more frequently by
girls was making negative comments about a schoolmate’s body, weight, or
2
clothing (χ = 10.89, p < .01). When comparing the perpetrated behaviors
with the experienced behaviors, it is interesting to note that although it seems
common to call a schoolmate gay or lesbian, fewer students admit to experiencing this behavior, probably for homophobic reasons. It appears that calling classmates names and making negative comments has been normalized
by these students because both the perpetration and experience of these
behaviors are so prevalent.
Table 2 arrays the correlation matrix for all variables in the study. The frequency that peer sexual harassment is reported, both experience and utilization, is minimally but significantly correlated with the tendency to provide
socially desirable responses. Partial correlation analysis controlling for
social desirability suggests that student answers regarding sexual harassment
were not affected by social desirability.
According to Table 2, hypotheses of a relationship between power, gender, and the perpetration of PSH are supported. The more that boys and girls
endorse beliefs that men should be dominant, the more they report using sexual harassment with peers. When we examine the correlations between the
frequency that sexual harassment is used (PSH) and endorsement of beliefs

frequency that sexual harassment is used (PSH) and endorsement of beliefs
supporting male dominance (HRS) by gender, we see that the correlation is
weaker for girls (r = .28) than for boys (r = .49). Alternately, when we examine the relationship between the frequency that sexual harassment is used and
personal power (IPR), the effects are similar for girls and boys (r = .23 and r =
.29, respectively). We tentatively conclude that beliefs supporting male
dominance play a greater role in perpetration of sexual harassment for boys
than for girls. Beliefs about social roles may be a sustaining factor in teen
boys’ peer sexual harassment. The strength of a student’s endorsement of
beliefs about power and the frequency that he or she experiences peer sexual
harassment are also related. Students of both genders who score higher in
personal power experience more sexual harassment. The strength of the relationship between male social role beliefs and victimization rates is similar for
boys and girls (r = .28 and r = .20, respectively), but victimization has a
stronger positive relationship with personal power for boys (r = .42) than for
girls (r = .21). Consequently, whether we look at power at the level of beliefs
about proper gender relationships or power at the level of personal selfefficacy, power appears to be more of a factor for boys than for girls in this
sample. Likewise, whether we look at power as a factor in victimization or
power as a factor in utilization, power appears to be more of a factor for boys
than for girls. This finding parallels studies of the relationship between power
motivation, substance abuse, and aggression, which also appears to be malespecific (Graham, 1980).
The relationship between perpetrator and victim is an important factor in
peer sexual harassment. We expected that sexual harassment would be more
prevalent between strangers than between intimates. However, as Figure 1
illustrates, the chance of being harassed by a schoolmate that the student
knows casually is greater for both boys and girls than the chances of being
harassed by either strangers or by dating or ex-dating intimates. This may be
an artifact of greater exposure to known peers than to strangers, but we are
unable to address this possible confounding factor with our data.
Although not statistically different, girls do experience more sexual harassment across all three peer relationship categories. Figure 2 compares the
percentages for the perpetrators of sexual harassment by relationship and
gender. It is interesting that the rate of perpetration by girls is slightly higher
than by boys for both stranger and intimate relationships. As in research on
adult partner violence, the finding of greater prevalence for girls should not
be taken at face value but can only be understood contextually (Saunders,
1988).
To more fully describe the experience of sexual harassment, we asked students how threatened or upset they felt by the experience of peer sexual

harassment. Reaction to sexual harassment by item and by gender is listed in
Table 1. The difference in perceived threat by gender is statistically significant by t tests for 10 of the 12 behaviors listed in Table 1. The two behaviors
that were not significantly different were being called gay or lesbian and
being the victim of sexual graffiti. Regardless of the prevalence or the nature
of the item, girls perceive all forms of peer sexual harassment as a greater
threat than boys. We predicted that sexual harassment by strangers would
pose the greatest amount of threat. When comparing the three different peer
relationships, schoolmates who are known to students appear to propose the
most threat, whereas intimates threaten them less. Although the prevalence
of sexual harassment from known peers is not surprising, the degree to which
such harassment upsets victims is somewhat surprising.

DISCUSSION

The rates of sexual harassment in the current study are consistent with frequencies from the AAUW (1993) and PCSW (1995) studies. These data support a concern that sexual harassment between high school peers is widespread. It remains difficult to explain why the rate of sexual harassment for
both boys and girls is so high. Fitzgerald et al. (1993) estimate that 50% of
women in the workforce have experienced sexual harassment. This is lower
than the 80% figures found in studies of high schools. However, the rate for

Fineran, Bennett / PEER SEXUAL HARASSMENT

637

Figure 2: Rate of Sexual Harassment Perpetration

adult men in the workplace is only 2% to 5%, compared to the 50% to 80%
rate documented in high school studies. It may be that sexual harassment
decreases in adulthood. Alternately, it may be that sexual harassment is indistinguishable from normal adult life. The majority of sexual harassment that
occurs in the workplace is considered to be gender harassment, inflicted by
both peers and supervisors. It may be that sexual harassment by peers is not
recognized as such. The more notorious “sex for your job” or quid pro quo
sexual harassment is actually much less common and accounts for only about
3% of the adult cases (Langelan, 1993). Our data suggest that more attention
should be directed at the hostile environment created by peers.
The fact that many adolescents (and adults) regard what we term sexual
harassment as normative behavior does not lessen its effects: 70% of those
students who experience sexual harassment are the target of schoolmates
they know casually. Sexual harassment is the norm for teens if we accept the
definition operationalized in our research. Normative beliefs about the
behavior we are defining as sexual harassment is further evidence of its
entrenchment, including the near inseparability of interpersonal relationships and male dominance beliefs and behavior.
Experiencing sexual harassment proves to be a strong correlate of perpetrating sexual harassment; however, our research is unable to establish the
causal relationship between experiencing and perpetrating sexual harassment. Boys and girls who are targets of sexual harassment might target others. The data support such a cycle of violence conceptualization (Widom,

638

JOURNAL OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE / June 1999

1989). It is also possible, although less likely, that students may use sexual
harassment and then, subsequently, become the targets of harassment themselves. Further research is required to elucidate both the causal relationship
between victimization and perpetration and typologies of sexual harassment
victims and perpetrators.
In this research, we found a link between the frequency of peer sexual harassment behavior, male power beliefs, and personal power beliefs. Sexual
harassment creates and supports a hierarchy in which boys and girls who
endorse beliefs that men should be dominant victimize more often. This perspective is consistent with some dating violence research suggesting that
beliefs about gender rather than gender itself are associated with physical
aggression in college dating relationships (Thompson, 1991).
The issue of personal power is interesting because students of both genders who are higher in personal power scores experience more sexual harassment and are more adversely affected by it. Victimization has a stronger positive relationship with personal power for boys than for girls. This gender
difference may be explained by boys’ socialization. Boys may experience
greater social pressure to be in control, so experiencing sexual harassment
may challenge them on a more personal level than girls.
The methodology employed in this study limits our confidence in the
results. Sampling was not random, and the high school studied may be atypical of urban public schools. In addition to the nature of the sample, we are
concerned about the marginal alpha levels for the power scales. In part, this
may be due to different perceptions of boys and girls about gender-based
power. Further study of power and its relationship to gender and to dominant
behavior is needed to clarify this problem (Leone & Burns, 1997).
We have raised a number of questions pertaining to peer sexual harassment that require further exploration. The question of why girls’use of sexual
harassment is so elevated in high school and then appears to drop off significantly in college and the workplace remains intriguing. We can only speculate about motivation. Is the controlling behavior of adult women underreported as some critics suggest (Paglia, 1994; Straus, 1993)? Or, like domestic
abuse between adults, is the context of sexual harassment necessary to understand its meaning? Is the use of sexual harassment by girls in our study an
indicator not of dominance but of reaction to dominance? Although little is
known at present about the differential motivation for sexual harassment by
gender, experts in domestic violence argue that women are violent with men
for different reasons than men are violent with women. Women’s use of violence is more likely to be motivated by self-defense (Saunders, 1988). Gagne
and Lavoie (1993) found that boys and girls alike attributed girls’ use of dating violence to provocation and self-defense, whereas boys’ violence was

attributed to more internal causes. Do girls feel less socially constrained
regarding retaliation in high school, thus allowing them to perpetrate sexual
harassment at greater frequency? Or are they perpetrating without provocation and it is this phenomenon that is unusual? There are clear differences
between adult sexual harassment and adolescent sexual harassment, and further research is necessary to ferret out these complexities.
In this research, we add beliefs about gender role power and personal
power to gender as important considerations when describing teen peer sexual harassment. We suspect that, like partner violence, sexual harassment
behaviors mean something different to boys and girls. A feminist framework
of gender and power explains some of what we observe but not nearly
enough. Further explanation is necessary, however, because boys and girls
are clearly living under a barrage of mutual harassment that has become
background noise for some but shrill distraction for others. The consequences of this noise and distraction demand our further deliberation.
