Abstract Associations among bullying, peer victimization, sexual harassment, and dating violence were examined
among 684 middle and high school students. Cluster analysis
of self-report measures revealed four distinct bully-victim
subtypes: uninvolved, victims, bully-victims, and bullies.
African-American students comprised the bully cluster more
than White students, but did not report higher rates of dating
violence or peer sexual harassment. Bully-victims reported
significantly more physical dating violence victimization
than members of all other groups, and more emotional abuse
in dating relationships than uninvolved students and victims.
Bully-victims and victims also reported the highest amount
of peer sexual harassment. Anxiety/depression levels were
highest among victims and bully-victims. Sexual harassment
and dating violence experiences moderated the association
between bully-victim subtype and anxiety/depression. That
is, victims with the highest levels of sexual harassment and
victims and bully-victims with the highest levels of dating
violence reported the highest levels of anxiety/depression.
Findings highlight the high-risk nature of the bully-victim

group and the importance of assessing multiple forms of
victimization affecting youth.

One area of particular interest to practicing psychologists,
scholars, and educators who develop school-based prevention programs is youth aggression and peer victimization.
Longitudinal investigations have shown that childhood aggression is one of the best-known social predictors of future
maladjustment (Parker and Asher, 1987). Students who are
involved in aggressive acts either as victims (targets) or perpetrators are at-risk for developing potentially severe social,
emotional, behavioral, and academic problems. A plethora
of research has been conducted on peer victimization in the
form of physical, verbal, and relational forms of aggression
(see Juvonen and Graham, 2001 for a review), however, much
less attention has been given to sexual harassment and dating violence victimization among adolescents. This current
study addresses a major gap in the literature by investigating
multiple forms of peer victimization among adolescents and
their associations with anxiety/depression.

Research has documented the fact that children experience
bullying differently, both in terms of behavioral patterns and
psychosocial adjustment (Espelage and Holt, 2001; Espelage
and Swearer, 2003; Schwartz et al., 2001; Swearer et al.,
2001). Differences among children involved in bullying have
been conceptualized through categorizing youth into one of
four groups: (1) bullies, the children who frequently bully
others but are never victims; (2) bully-victims, the children
who bully others and are victimized themselves; (3) victims,
children who are victimized but do not resort to aggression
against others; and (4) controls, also uninvolved or no status,

children who have no significant history as aggressors or
victims (Espelage and Holt, 2001). Although the majority
of youth tend to be classified as uninvolved, there remains
a substantial subset of adolescents considered to be bullies,
bully-victims, or victims.
Specifically, in a nationally representative study of 6th–
10th graders (N = 15,686), using self-report data 13% of the
sample was categorized as bullies, 11% as victims, and 6%
as bully-victims (Nansel et al., 2001). When peer-, teacher, and self-reports were used to classify a large sample of
6th graders (N = 1,985); the authors found 7% bullies, 9%
victims, and 6% were bully-victims (Juvonen et al., 2003).
Both studies highlight the widespread nature of bullying
involvement, and point to the need for additional research to
address what differentiates youth in these three groups.
The discrimination between bully and bully-victim groups
has aroused particular interest because these subgroups appear to display different patterns of aggression. Bullies exhibit a more goal-oriented aggression, entailing more control
and planning. In contrast, the bully-victims tend to display
a more impulsive aggression, manifesting poor regulation
of affect and behavior, which is perceived as particularly
aversive by their peers (Schwartz et al., 2001). In addition,
bully-victims are at greatest risk for social maladjustment
and therefore, as will be examined in the current study, might
be at-risk for victimization in other domains. Research has
also reported that bully-victims tend to report more depression and anxiety than their peers (Swearer et al., 2001) and
are the most rejected group along the bully-victim spectrum
(Warden and McKinnon, 2003). Thus, bully-victims might
be particularly at-risk for being victimized in other interpersonal contexts. While this group is the subject of very little
research, a number of theoretical arguments can be drawn
from the general victimization literature that might explain
the potential overlap across victimization experiences. These
will be discussed after a brief discussion of the prevalence
of sexual harassment and dating violence.
Prevalence of sexual harassment victimization
Two surveys conducted by American Association of University Women (American Association of University Women
Educational Foundation, 1993, 2001), asked nationally representative samples of public school students about their
experiences with sexual harassment at school. Sexual harassment was defined as “unwanted and unwelcome sexual
behavior that interferes with your life. Sexual harassment is
not behaviors that you like or want (for example wanted kissing, touching, or flirting). ” (p. 2, American Association of
University Women Educational Foundation, 2001). Results
from both the 1993 AAUW and 2001 AAUW surveys revealed that sexual harassment was widespread among youth.

Springer

Specifically, eight in ten students (81%) had experienced
some form of sexual harassment at some time during their
school lives with six in 10 occasionally and 1/4 often experiencing sexual harassment. Seventy-percent experienced
nonphysical sexual harassment at some point in their school
lives, and more than 50% experienced it often or occasionally. Physical sexual harassment was reported by 58% of
students as happening at some point in their school lives,
and 32% experienced this form of sexual harassment often
or occasionally. Forty-eight percent of students were upset
when they experienced both forms of sexual harassment. Although these studies provided awareness about the problem
of sexual harassment in our schools, much more work is
needed in order to explicate how sexual harassment relates
to other forms of victimization. For instance, are victims of
sexual harassment also victims of bullying? This is an area
not yet addressed in the literature that we will focus on in
this study.

Prevalence of dating violence victimization
Dating violence is another form of interpersonal violence
with high rates among youth (see Ely et al., 2002 for a
review). Studies suggest that between 10% (Roscoe and
Callahan, 1985) and 55% (O’Keefe, 1998) of adolescents
have been the targets of dating violence. Estimates tend
to be the highest when emotional abuse is considered to
constitute dating violence (Bookwala et al., 1992). Research
has indicated that less severe forms of physical violence
(e.g., slapping) are more common than extreme forms
(e.g., choking) (Roscoe and Callahan, 1985). To capture a
range of dating violence victimization, both emotional and
physical forms were assessed in this study.
Regardless of the type of dating violence experienced, it
is often associated with negative emotional outcomes. Carlson’s (Carlson, 1987) review of the literature suggests that
effects of victimization include feelings of confusion, anger,
sadness, and diminished self-esteem. According to a study
of 123 high school students conducted by Burcky and colleagues (Burcky et al., 1988), 56% of victims indicated that
although the incident(s) upset them there were no long-term
effects, whereas 8% reported more long-standing emotional
disturbance. As such, dating violence appears to have serious consequences. However, more research needs to be conducted to determine why some victims are more adversely
affected than others. One possibility is that targets of dating
violence who are also victimized in other domains experience the most deleterious outcomes; this hypothesis will be
evaluated in this study. As is detailed below, theoretical and
empirical evidence exists suggesting that victimization often
co-occurs.

J Youth Adolescence

Multiple forms of victimization
Much of the extant literature on multiple victimization experiences among adolescents has focused on various forms of
child maltreatment (Hibbard et al., 1990) or has investigated
whether victims of child maltreatment are also targets of peer
victimization (Shields and Cicchetti, 2001). However, few
studies have evaluated the co-occurrence of multiple types
of peer victimization. The limited existing research in this
area suggests that bullying victimization is associated with
sexual harassment and dating violence victimization (Holt
and Espelage, 2005), and that bullying perpetration is associated with being aggressive with dating partners (Connolly
et al., 2000). It is particularly important to assess multiple
peer victimization among adolescents given evidence in the
broader victimization literature that students who have experienced multiple forms of maltreatment report more psychological distress than their peers who have experienced
singular victimization forms or have not incurred any victimization (Harned, 2000; Hibbard et al., 1990; Holt and
Espelage, 2003; Naar-King et al., 2002).
Several theories have emerged in the literature to explain
the potential association of bullying victimization and other
forms of victimization among youth. The developmental
victimology framework, for instance, suggests that many
victimization types have similar risk factors (Finkelhor and
Asdigian, 1996; Finkelhor and Dziuba-Leatherman, 1994;
Finkelhor and Kendall-Tackett, 1997; Lagerspetz, 1982).
Further, the framework indicates that experiencing victimization might increase vulnerability for future victimization.
This fits with findings put forth by other scholars. For example, antecedents to being victimized by a peer in young childhood include nonassertive behavioral play styles (Schwartz
et al., 1993), and that once this victimization occurs then
children develop certain behavioral and personality features
that appear to increase the likelihood of future victimization.
Victimizations lead to peer rejection and social withdrawal
and over time contribute to more victimization (Hodges and
Perry, 1999).
Other explanations for why youth might experience multiple forms of victimization have also drawn from attribution
theory, finding that peer victims often engage in self-blaming
attributions (Graham and Juvonen, 1998). Eventually some
victims develop an internalized self-schema through which
other victimization experiences are attributed to flaws within
him/her, self-blaming attributions are made, and psychological distress ensues (Graham and Juvonen, 1998). Similarly,
the traumagenic dynamics model (Finkelhor and Browne,
1985) addresses coping mechanisms, and posits that the way
in which sexually abused children experience and cope with
their abuse helps to explain subsequent victimizations. It is
also likely that the absence or presence of prior victimization
experiences serve as stress buffering and stress exacerbating

effects. As such, it might be that having experienced multiple forms of victimization leads to increased stress levels
and greater distress. Thus, in this study, history of sexual harassment and dating violence experiences were evaluated as
moderators of the association between bully-victim subtypes
and anxiety/depression (Rook, 1992, 1998). When bully victimization occurs, it is possible that a student’s level of psychological anxiety/depression is buffered if they do not have
a history of sexual harassment and dating violence, but exacerbated when they have a history of victimization in these
domains.

Sex & race influences on victimization
This study also explored sex and race differences on victimization experiences and the impact of these demographic
variables on the relations among bully-victim subtype, other
forms of victimization, and anxiety/depression.
Bullying & victimization
In general, boys are more likely to engage in physical
bullying than girls (Espelage et al., 2000; McDermott,
1996); however, sex differences in verbal bullying are less
consistent (Knight et al., 2002). A few studies examined
race/ethnicity differences across the bully-victim continuum, but more research is needed. Nansel et al. (2001)
found that Hispanic youth reported bullying others only
marginally more than White or Black students, whereas
Black youth reported being bullied significantly more than
Whites or Hispanics. In contrast, Graham and Juvonen
(2002) found that African-Americans were more likely to
be nominated as aggressive than Latino and multiethnic
urban middle school students. Similarly, in a study using a
multi-informant assessment approach (i.e., self, peer, and
teacher), Black youth were most likely to be classified as
bullies and bully-victims, while Whites were most likely to
be classified as borderline (Juvonen et al., 2003).
The dearth of literature on race/ethnicity and multiple
forms of victimization led to the current study’s focus on
race/ethnicity differences.
Sexual harassment
In both AAUW surveys (1993, 2001), girls reported more
sexual harassment experiences than boys. However, a significant increase from 1993 to 2001 in the number of boys
experiencing sexual harassment occasionally (56% vs. 49%)
or often (25% vs. 18%) was found. Girls at both assessments
reported that others made sexual comments, jokes, gestures
or looks toward them the most often (31%, 34%), which
was following by being touched, grabbed, or pinched in a
Springer

J Youth Adolescence

sexual way (17%, 20%). These were also the most common
for boys at both assessments, however, more boys reported
having sexual comments, jokes, gestures or looks directed
at them (53%, 48%) and being touched, grabbed, or pinched
in a sexual way across the two time points (40%, 29%). In
2001, girls who experienced any kind of sexual harassment
most often reported one-on-one, male to female harassment,
while boys were most likely to be sexually harassed by one
other girl or an all-female group. In terms of racial/ethnic
differences, White boys were more likely than their AfricanAmerican peers to have had someone pull off or down their
clothing (21% vs. 10%). African-American girls were more
likely than Hispanic and White girls to be touched, grabbed,
or pinched in a sexual way (67%, 51%, 51%), to have had
someone pull at their clothing in a sexual way (50%, 30%,
32%) and to be forced to kiss someone (28%, 18%, 15%).
The current study will add to our understanding of sex and
racial/ethnic differences in prevalence rates and correlates of
sexual harassment.
Dating violence
Conflicting information exists with respect to differences
in dating violence rates by sex and race. For example, in a
study of 719 ethnically diverse high school students the rate
of physical dating violence victimization did not differ for
males and females (Malik et al., 1997). Conversely, of the
207 high school students surveyed by Roscoe and Callahan
(1985) significantly more females (65%) than males (35%)
were the targets of violence. With respect to psychological
abuse, a study of 37 adolescents in an alternative high school
program revealed that males and females were victimized
at approximately the same rate (James et al., 2001). This
contrasted Molidor’s (Molidor, 1995) finding that males
reported higher amounts of psychological abuse than females and Foshee’s 1996 study where females experienced
more psychological abuse than males did. Less research
has explored dating violence victimization rates across
ethnic/racial groups. In one study of 1,976 eighth and ninth
grade students, results showed that White adolescents reported less non-sexual victimization than African-American
adolescents (Foshee et al., 1996). Another study of high
school students revealed that African-American females
were less frequently targets of dating violence than their Caucasian female peers (O’Keefe and Treister, 1998). This study
will inform existing contradictory information on sex and
racial/ethnic differences in dating violence victimization.
Summary
Again, the majority of the studies that have investigated sex
and race in relation to these forms of victimization have been
largely descriptive. Virtually none have considered these deSpringer

mographic variables in inferential models where multiple
predictors are considered. It could be that a descriptive approach overstates the influence of these variables. This study
therefore is the first study to examine sex and race in more
comprehensive models to understand how race and/or sex
impact the association between experiences with sexual harassment and dating violence across bully-victim subtypes.
Hypotheses
This study examined whether bully-victim subtypes among
middle and high school students differed in their experiences of sexual harassment and dating violence. Given the
well-documented literature that males score higher on bully
measures, it was hypothesized that more males than females
would be classified as bullies and bully-victims. Based on the
limited research on race/ethnicity differences, it was hypothesized that African-American students would have greater
representation in the bully and bully-victim subtypes and
report more sexual harassment and dating violence victimization than White students. As peer victimization (especially name-calling) can take the form of sexual harassment,
it was further hypothesized that bully-victims and victims
would report more sexual harassment experiences as a target than uninvolved individuals. However, victims were not
hypothesized to have more dating violence victimization experiences because it is expected that they are less likely to
date than the other students. Explanatory models of multiple victimization supported our final hypothesis that sexual
harassment victimization would moderate the association between bully-victim subtype and anxiety/depression. That is,
bullies, victims, and bully-victims with greater sexual harassment experiences would report more anxiety/depression than
group members with less sexual harassment experiences. A
similar hypothesis was set forth for dating violence.
Method
Participants
Participants were 684 youth, including 369 (54%) middle school and 315 (46%) high school students. The middle school was located in a suburb of a large Midwestern
city and the high school was located in a small Midwestern city. All students from these schools were invited to
participate, and 100% of students whose parents agreed to
their participation (see below) elected to complete the survey. There were 320 (47%) males and 364 (53%) females.
With respect to race, respondents identified themselves as
Caucasian, Non-Hispanic (N = 415; 60.7%) and AfricanAmerican (N = 269; 34.3%). Of these students, 198 were
seventh graders (28.9%), 171 were eighth graders (25.0%),

J Youth Adolescence

112 were ninth graders (16.4%), 21 were tenth graders
(3.1%), 101 were eleventh graders (14.8%), and 81 were
twelfth graders (11.8%). Few tenth grade students participated in the study because school policy was such that tenth
graders do not typically enroll in physical education classes,
the setting in which surveys were administered. The mean
age for the sample was 14.50 (SD = 1.97). With respect to
socio-economic status, although we did not collect this information directly from students, school-district records indicate that approximately 42% of middle school students and
43% of high school students were classified as low-income.
Procedure
Parental consent
Passive parental consent was used in this investigation to
maximize participation. This form of consent was approved
by the university institutional review board, by the school
district’s research coordinator, and by the school administrators. Parents of all students enrolled in physical education
classes were sent letters informing them about the purpose of
the study. Furthermore, parents were asked to sign the form
and return it only if they were unwilling to have their child
participate in the investigation; no forms were returned. In
addition to passive parental consent, students were asked to
consent to participate in the study through an informed consent form included in the questionnaire packet. All students
who were present on the day of survey administration elected
to participate.
Survey administration
Six trained research assistants, the primary researcher, and
a faculty member collected data. At least two of these
individuals administered surveys to each physical education
class, which ranged in size from 25 to 50. Students were
first informed about the general nature of the investigation.
Next, researchers made certain that students were sitting far
enough from one another to ensure confidentiality. Students
were then given survey packets and asked to answer all
questions honestly. Researchers were available to answer
questions that emerged once students began responding to
survey items. When students had completed the surveys they
were given the opportunity to have their data removed from
analyses if they had not carefully considered each question.
Each participant was also provided with a list of phone
numbers to call (e.g., community counseling agencies)
should they experience an emotional reaction to the questionnaires. Last, a raffle was held in each group in which one
student won a $10 gift certificate to a local mall. On average
it took students approximately 45 min to complete the
survey.

Measures
Each participant first completed a demographic questionnaire that included questions about his/her sex, age, grade,
and race. For race, participants were given six options:
African-American (not Hispanic), Asian, White (not Hispanic), Hispanic, Native American, and Other (with a space
to write in the most appropriate racial descriptor such as
bi-racial). Only White and African-American students were
included in the analyses; students who identified as Asian,
Hispanic, Native American, and Other (n = 100) were excluded from the analyses.
Students also completed items from the scales listed below. All scales were selected for their documented effective
use in middle and high school populations and their strong
psychometric properties. Because surveys were given to students’ in groups, and in the case of middle school students
were read aloud, scale order was not counterbalanced.
Self-reported bullying behavior
The nine-item University of Illinois Bully Scale (UIBS;
(Espelage and Holt, 2001) was used to assess bullying behavior including teasing, social exclusion, name-calling, and
rumor spreading. Researchers developed this scale based on
interviews with middle school students, a review of the research literature on existing bullying measures, and extensive
factor analytic investigations (Espelage et al., 2000; Espelage
et al., 2003). Students are asked to indicate how often in the
past 30 days they have engaged in each behavior (e.g., “I
teased other students” and “I upset other students for the fun
of it”). Response options include “Never,” “1 or 2 times,” “3
or 4 times,” “5 or 6 times,” and “7 or more times.” These
response options allow for the assessment of the persistence
of the bullying. Higher scores indicate more self-reported
bullying behaviors. Espelage and Holt (Espelage and Holt,
2001) found a Cronbach alpha coefficient of .87 and the Bullying Scale was found to be moderately correlated (r = .65)
with the Youth Self-Report Aggression Scale (Achenbach,
1991), suggesting convergent validity. This scale was also
found to converge with peer nomination data (Espelage et al.,
2003). This scale was not significantly correlated with the
Illinois Victimization Scale (r = .12), providing evidence of
discriminant validity (Espelage et al., 2003). A Cronbach
alpha coefficient of .90 was found for the current sample.
Self-reported victimization
Victimization from peers was assessed using the University
of Illinois Victimization Scale (UIVS; Espelage and Holt,
2001). Students are asked how often the following things
have happened to them in the past 30 days (i.e., “Other students called me names”, “Other students made fun of me,”
Springer

J Youth Adolescence

“Other students picked on me,” and “I got hit and pushed by
other students”). Response options include “Never,” “1 or 2
times,” “3 or 4 times,” “5 or 6 times,” and “7 or more times.”
Higher scores indicate more self-reported victimization. Further, the scale was found to converge with peer nomination
data (Espelage et al., 2003). As noted above, this scale was
not significantly correlated with the Illinois Bullying scale
(r = .12), providing evidence of discriminant validity (Espelage et al., 2003). A Cronbach alpha coefficient of .86 was
found for current study.
Peer sexual harassment
The AAUW Sexual Harassment Survey (American Association of University Women Educational Foundation, 1993)
is a 14-item inventory designed to measure the frequency
with which students are victimized by sexually harassing
behaviors. Participants are asked to indicate how often other
students engaged in particular behaviors aimed at the participant (e.g., made sexual comments, jokes, gestures, or
looks) within the previous year. Items reflect verbal and physical harassment. Response options are “Not sure,” “Never,”
“Rarely,” “Occasionally,” and “Often.” Coefficient alpha for
this sample was .90. No additional validity or reliability information exists for this scale.
Physical victimization in dating relationships
The Victimization in Dating Relationships scale (Foshee,
1996) is an 18-item inventory designed to measure physically violent victimization within dating relationships. Participants are asked to indicate how often individuals they
went on dates with engaged in particular behaviors (e.g.,
scratched me, kicked me) and are instructed to only count
behaviors that their partners inflicted on them first. Violence
inflicted due to self-defense therefore is not measured by the
Victimization in Dating Relationships scale. There are four
response options: “Never,” “1 to 3 times,” “4 to 9 times,” and
“10 or more times.” For the current sample, the coefficient
alpha was .94.
Emotional abuse in dating relationships
The Abusive Behavior Inventory (ABI; Shepard and Campbell, 1992) measures physical, emotional/psychological, and
sexual abuse in dating relationships. Only the emotional
abuse scale was used in this study. Nine items tapping a
range of psychologically abusive behaviors (e.g., “How often has a dating partner said something to scare you?”) were
administered. Response options ranged from “Never” (0)
through “Often” (4), and participants were also given the opportunity to select ‘Not sure’ as a response. In the development sample, ABI items successfully differentiated individSpringer

uals in abusive and non-abusive relationships, providing support for the ABI’s criterion validity (Shepard and Campbell,
1992). The resulting alpha coefficient for the current study
was .89.
Anxiety/depression
The anxiety/depression scale from the Youth Self-Report
(YRS; Achenbach, 1991) was used to assess psychological
functioning. This scale consists of 16 self-report items and
students are asked to indicate the degree to which particular
statements apply to them (e.g., “I feel lonely,” “I am nervous
or tense”). Response options are “Not true,” “Somewhat or
sometimes true,” and “Very true or Often true.” Numerous
studies have supported this instrument’s reliability and validity (Achenbach, 1991; Bennett and Bates, 1995; Visser
et al., 1999). A coefficient alpha coefficient was .90 for this
study.
Results
Cluster analysis
We conducted a k-means cluster analysis using SPSS and SYSTAT to create bully-victim subtypes. Items from the University of Illinois Bully and Victimization Scales (Espelage
and Holt, 2001) were input for these analyses. Based on literature supporting that typically four groups of youth exist
with respect to bullying and victimization (bullies, victims,
bully/victims, and neither bullies nor victims), we hypothesized that these four clusters would emerge. We first utilized
Ward’s algorithm (Ward, 1963) to derive cluster solutions.
This method minimizes the variance within clusters at each
stage of grouping (Borgen and Barnett, 1987). Comparative
studies have found that Ward’s method is one of the more
effective cluster-analytic approaches (Borgen and Barnett,
1987). However, Ward’s method has also been criticized because of its tendencies to produce results that are heavily
influenced by profile elevation (Aldenderfer and Blashfield,
1984), and yield clusters with relatively equivalent numbers
of observations (Hair and Black, 2000). Consequently, the
complete linkage method was also utilized. This method
combines cases with the smallest maximum distance at each
stage of the agglomeration (Borgen and Barnett, 1987; Hair
and Black, 2000). Results of cluster analyses utilizing both
of these methods suggested that a four cluster solution was
appropriate for the data.
Following calculation of the cluster solution via these
hierarchical methods, we re-analyzed the data utilizing
a nonhierarchical clustering method, k-means iterative
partitioning. This method requires that the number of
clusters be specified in advance. Milligan (Milligan, 1980)
has suggested that k-means clustering is an appropriate

J Youth Adolescence

follow-up analysis to hierarchical clustering techniques.
Similarly, Kinder and his colleagues (Kinder et al., 1991)
recommend a two-stage approach in which both hierarchical
and nonhierarchical methods are used.
Cluster descriptions
Cluster one, defined as the “Uninvolved” cluster, included the
majority of students (N = 400; 58.5%). These students had
both the lowest mean bullying (M = 16.85, SD = 2.64) and
the lowest mean peer victimization (M = 5.36, SD = 1.64)
scores. Cluster two, characterized by youth who scored
nearly one standard deviation above the bullying mean
(M = 29.14, SD = 5.10) and almost at the mean for victimization (M = 6.48, SD = 2.29), was labeled the “Bullies”
cluster (N = 102; 15%). The fewest students (N = 30; 4.4%)
were classified as members of Cluster three, identified as
the “Bully-victims” group because on average their bullying
scores (M = 50.40, SD = 8.52) were three standard deviations above the sample mean, and their victimization scores
(M = 8.30, SD = 4.08) were approximately one-half a standard deviation above the sample mean. Finally, cluster four
was designated the “Victims” group (N = 92; 14%); on average, members of this group had scores near the mean for
bullying (M = 23.38, SD = 6.11) and almost two standard
deviations above the mean for victimization (M = 14.33,
SD = 3.19). Differences among clusters on bullying (F (3,
620) = 756.17, p < .001) and peer victimization (F (3,
620) = 418.23, p < .001) scores were statistically significant
(See Table 1). Further, post-hoc tests revealed statistically
significant differences between all cluster pairings. In particular, bully-victims reported more bullying behaviors than
members of any other cluster, whereas victims revealed more
peer victimization than youth in all other clusters.
In these models there also were significant interactions.
For bullying behaviors, there was a significant interaction between cluster and race (F (3, 608) = 3.06, p < .05), however
this effect was small (η2 = .02). With respect to peer victimization, there was no statistically significant interaction

Cluster demographic characteristics. However, testing cluster differences on demographic characteristics using χ 2 analysis revealed statistically significant differences for sex (χ 2 (3, N = 624) = 11.73, p < .01), race
(χ 2 (3, N = 624) = 55.43, p < .01), and school (χ 2 (3,
N = 719) = 35.6, p < .01). With respect to sex, a greater percentage of females (69.7%) were in the uninvolved cluster
than males (57.3%), whereas a greater percentage of males
were in the three remaining groups (18.5% male vs. 14.6%
female bullies; 6.8% male vs. 3.2% female bully-victims;
17.4% male vs. 12.5% female victims). In terms of race,
our hypothesis was supported; more White than African-

American students were classified in the uninvolved group
(72.7% White vs. 49.6% African-American), and a greater
percentage of African-American youth comprised the bullies
(28.4% African-American vs. 9.2% White) and bully-victim
(8.6% African-American vs. 2.6% White) clusters. Conversely, although not a large difference, more White (15.6%)
than African-American (13.4%) students were in the Victims
cluster. Finally, a higher percentage of high school (74.8%)
than middle school (55.5%) students were included in the
uninvolved cluster. Middle school students were more representative than high school students in the bullies (22.3% vs.
9.0%), bully-victims (5.8% vs. 3.6%), and victims (16.5%
vs. 12.6%) clusters.
Given that clusters differed by demographic characteristics, in subsequent analyses we included sex, race, and school
in interaction terms.
Dating violence and sexual harassment victimization
by cluster membership
We calculated three 4 (cluster) X 2 (sex) X 2 (race) ANOVAs
to determine if mean scores on physical dating violence victimization, emotional abuse in dating relationships, and sexual harassment victimization differed across clusters.
First, the main effect for race was evaluated in order to test
the hypothesis that African-American students would report
more sexual harassment and dating violence victimization
than White students. In contrast to the hypothesis, main effects for race were not significant for sexual harassment
victimization (F (1, 592) = 1.99, p > .05; η2 = .003), physical dating violence victimization (F (1, 592) = .19, p > .05;
η2 = .000), or emotional dating violence (F (1, 592) = .72,
p > .05; η2 = .001).
As hypothesized, statistically significant results
emerged for physical dating violence victimization (F
(3, 592) = 18.38, p < .001; η2 = .09), suggesting that
cluster membership was associated with dating violence
experiences. Specifically, results indicated that individuals
in the bully-victims cluster reported the most physical
dating violence victimization, and that the mean of this
group was significantly higher than the mean for any other
cluster (See Table 2). Youth classified in the uninvolved
cluster had physical dating violence victimization scores
that were, on average, significantly lower than students in
the bullies or bully-victims groups. Interaction terms for
demographic characteristics (race, sex, school) by cluster
were not statistically significant.
Similar findings resulted when considering emotional
abuse in dating relationships by cluster membership, and
again, cluster membership was related to experiencing
emotional abuse (F (3, 592) = 14.01, p < .001; η2 = .07).
As shown in Table 2, students in the bully-victims cluster
reported the most emotional abuse victimization in dating

Discussion
Sexual harassment as a moderator between bully-victim
subtype & anxiety/depression
A regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the hypothesis that sexual harassment experiences moderate the relation
between bully-victim subtypes and the dependent variable
of anxiety/depression. For these analyses, total scores on
the AAUW sexual harassment scale were converted to a
categorical variable with three levels (low, moderate, high)
using a tertial split. Bully-victim subtype, sexual harassment categorical variable, sex, race, and school were independent variables in a 4 (cluster) X 3 (sexual harassment
level) X 2 (sex) X 2 (race) ANOVA with anxiety/depression
as the dependent variable. ANOVA was used over regression in order to prevent the use of dummy variables for the
cluster variable. Significant interactions were plotted following Aiken and West (1991) guidelines using ModGraph
(Jose, 2003). A significant bully-victim subtype by sexual harassment interaction was found for anxiety/depression and
means for each group are plotted in Fig. 1. As hypothesized, bully-victims and victims with the highest levels
of sexual harassment reported the highest levels of anxiety/depression. No interactions with sex, race, or school were
significant.
Dating violence as a moderator between bully-victim
subtype & anxiety/depression
A final set of analyses evaluated the hypothesis that dating violence would moderate between bully-victim subtype
and the dependent variable of anxiety/depression. For these
analyses, emotional and physical forms of dating violence
were collapsed in order to limit the number of tests conducted. Total scores on this composite were converted to a
categorical variable with three levels (low, moderate, high)
using a tertial split. Bully-victim subtype, dating violence
categorical variable, sex, race, and school were independent variables in a 4 (cluster) X 3 (dating violence level) X
2 (sex) X 2 (race) ANOVA with anxiety/depression as the
dependent variable. A significant bully-victim subtype by
dating violence composite interaction was found for anxiety/depression and means for each group are plotted in
Fig. 2. The hypothesis that victims and bully-victims with
more dating violence experiences would report more anxiety/depression was partially supported. Bully-victims with
the lowest levels of dating violence had the lowest selfreported anxiety/depression scores. However, victims and
bully-victims with moderate and high levels of dating vio-

Results from this investigation support previous findings that
adolescents can be grouped into four bully-victim subtypes
and that students involved in bullying in any capacity experience more anxiety/depression than uninvolved students.
Moreover, this research extends previous work on bullying
through identifying that bully-victims are at greatest risk
for dating violence and peer sexual harassment victimization. This study also documented that sexual harassment and
dating violence serve as moderators between bully-victim
subtypes and anxiety/depression. A detailed discussion of
all findings follows.
Bully-victim subtypes
Consistent with previous research (Juvonen et al., 2003;
Nansel et al., 2001), four subtypes of bully-victims emerged:
bullies, victims, bully-victims, and uninvolved students. Of
the adolescents surveyed, the majority (58.5%) were classified as uninvolved, 15% were identified as bullies, 14% were
considered victims, and 4.4% were categorized as bullyvictims. These rates are in line with other investigations of
middle and high school youth (Juvonen et al., 2003; Nansel
et al., 2001). A greater percentage of males comprised the
bully, bully-victim, and victim groups, whereas more females than males were considered uninvolved. This follows
existing research suggesting that boys engage in more bullying than girls (Espelage et al., 2000; McDermott, 1996). As
hypothesized, more African-American than White students
were in the bully and bully-victim groups, which is consistent
with Juvonen, Graham, and Schuster (Juvonen et al., 2003).
The dearth of previous research along these lines prevents us
from understanding why these differences emerged. It could
simply be that the assessment of bullying in this study might
be tapping normative types of peer group interactions and
expressiveness among African-American youth (Kochman,
1990).
Dating violence and sexual harassment victimization
by bully-victim subtype
This study is one of the first to explore the extent to which
peer victimization in one domain—in this case, the bullying continuum—is related to peer victimization in other
domains—in this case, dating violence and peer sexual harassment. Consistent with hypotheses, bully-victims reported
more physical dating violence and peer sexual harassment
than members of any other group, and more emotional abuse

as a particularly high-risk group (Kumpulainen et al., 1998;
Nansel et al., 2003; Nansel et al., 2001), this adds additional
evidence that bully-victims are a critical group to target in in-

tervention efforts. In particular, it is important to discern why
bully-victims are at heightened risk for victimization in other
peer domains. It might be that peer victimization is only one
component of bully-victims’ victimization experiences, and
that they have also experienced other intra- and extra-familial

victimization. If this is the case, their re-victimization might
be examined in light of models exploring common risk factors of victimization, such as the developmental victimology framework (Finkelhor and Dzuiba-Leatherman, 1994;
Finkelhor and Kendall-Tackett, 1997) or theories focused on
how effects of an initial victimization lead to subsequent peer
victimization and perpetration.
Victims also reported more peer sexual harassment than
uninvolved students, which was consistent with expectations,
but contrary to hypotheses, they also reported more dating
violence victimization than uninvolved youth. This suggests
that victims might be dating at similar rates as other youth,
and that their pattern of school victimization extends beyond
the school environment to other interpersonal relationships.
This has interesting implications for considering how victims
are characterized. Presumably when targeted at school by
bullies, victims often are not friends with their perpetrator.
This fits with the profile of a victim who tends to have few
friends (Hodges et al., 1997). However, in the context of
dating relationships one would assume there is at least a
friendship between the two parties, and as such the dynamic
is different. Is it that targets of bullies seek out dating partners
who are likely to victimize them? Further research is needed
to clarify the relation between being victimized at school and
on dates.
Anxiety/depression by bully-victim subtype
As hypothesized, bully-victim status was related to psychological functioning. Specifically, uninvolved students reported the least anxiety/depression, adding additional support to the wide body of literature concluding that uninvolved
students tend to be better adjusted than bullies, victims, or
bully-victims (Schwartz, 2000; Swearer et al., 2001). Furthermore, victims and bully-victims had the highest anxiety/depression levels. However, unlike findings from some
previous research (Schwartz, 2000; Swearer et al., 2001),
although bullies reported less anxiety/depression than the
victim clusters. It might be important in future investigations
to assess anxiety and depression separately in order to compare findings to Swearer and colleagues, where bullies had
the highest levels of depression (Swearer et al., 2001).
Moderating effects of sexual harassment
and dating violence
Results supported our hypothesis that sexual harassment
moderates the association between bully-victim status and
anxiety/depression, and partially supported our hypothesis
that dating violence moderates this relation. Specifically,
bully-victims and victims who had experienced high levels of sexual harassment victimization reported more anxiety/depression than their counterparts who had experienced

low or moderate levels of sexual harassment victimization.
This finding is consistent with extant research on multiple
victimization suggesting that adolescents who have experienced victimization in multiple domains experience more
psychological distress than youth who have experienced singular or no victimization (Hibbard et al., 1990; Holt and
Espelage, 2003; Hughes et al., 1989; Naar-King et al., 2002)
One potential explanation for the exacerbating effect of
sexual harassment and dating violence on the association
between bully-victim subtype and anxiety/depression could
be derived from attribution theory. Attribution style refers to
how people tend to explain the causes of their own and other’s
behavior (Aronson et al., 2002). Attributions tend to vary
along three dimensions: locus, stability, and controllability.
Locus is whether the cause is internal or external to the person, stability refers to whether the cause is stable or unstable
over time, and controllability refers to whether or not a cause
can be controlled by the person (Weiner, 1986). Graham
and Juvonen (Graham and Juvonen, 2001) provided middle
school students with two scenarios of hypothetical incidents
of victimization and found students who were victims of peer
victimization (bullying) endorsed significantly more characterological self-blaming attributions compared to nonvictims
in response to imagined incidents of harassment. These authors did not, however, consider how these attributions might
have been shaped by other victimization experiences. Studies
in the future on the effect of multiple victimization experiences should consider the role of attributions.
Limitations & implications
Despite its efforts to examine multiple victimization experiences, this study is cross-sectional in nature and therefore inferences about causality cannot be made. As such, it was not
possible to discern whether victimized students experienced
anxiety/depression as a consequence of their victimization or
whether these outcomes are reflect baseline functioning prior
to victimization. Longitudinal investigations are needed to
address this issue. In addition, only one outcome was assessed whereas victimization likely affects myriad factors.
For instance, salient outcomes of dating violence that have
at times been shown to differ for boys and girls, such as injury rates (e.g., Foshee, 1996), were not considered. Finally,
adolescent dating violence is often reciprocal in nature, and
future studies should attempt to assess the role of self-defense
or abuse within the dyadic relationship.
This study adds to a growing literature on children
and adolescents that have experienced multiple forms of
victimization. In the victimization literature, these children
are referred to poly-victims and have been neglected in
child victimization trauma theories (Finkelhor, Ormrod,
and Turner, under review). This study examined the overlap
among bullying victimization, sexual harassment, and dating

violence and provides initial support for the co-occurrence of
different forms of victimization. These findings indicate that
clinicians that obtain referrals for students who are involved
in bully-victim episodes should conduct a thorough assessment of victimization experiences. Clinicians should also
target personality and behavioral factors that might place an
individual child at-risk for subsequent victimization.
