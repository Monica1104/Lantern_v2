S' Teacher-Focused Approach to Prevent and Reduce\nStudents\xe2\x80\x99 Aggressive Behavior\nThe GREAT Teacher Program\nPamela Orpinas, PhD, Arthur M. Horne, PhD, and the Multisite Violence Prevention Project\n Abstract:\nThe purpose of this article is to describe the GREAT (Guiding Responsibility and Expectations for Adolescents for Today and Tomorrow) Teacher Program, a prevention program for middle school teachers to deter students\xe2\x80\x99 aggressive behavior. It was developed on the basis of an ecologic understanding of aggression and on specific constructs of Social Cognitive Theory. The goals of the program were (1) to increase teacher awareness of different types of aggression, risk factors, role of the classroom teacher, and influence of the school climate on the child\xe2\x80\x99s behavior; (2) to develop strategies that will prevent aggression; (3) to improve teacher management skills to reduce power struggles and aggression; and (4) to enhance skills to assist students who are the targets of aggression. To accomplish these goals, teachers participated in a 12-hour workshop and 10 support group sessions. Training, manuals, and supervision were provided to maintain program integrity and to assure the quality of implementation. (Am J Prev Med 2004;26(1S):29\xe2\x80\x9338)\n Introduction\nDuring the past decades, schools have imple- mented prevention programs to reduce aggres- sion in schools and to increase academic per- formance. The majority of these programs implement a student curriculum that is taught by a teacher or by a violence prevention specialist, such as Responding In Peaceful and Positive Ways,1 the Resolving Conflict Creatively Program,2 and Second Step.3 At the middle school level, few programs have been specifically de- signed to reduce aggression by modifying the school environment through increased recognition and con- trol of the problem by teachers.4\nPrograms specific to training middle school teachers are crucial. First, teachers are often involved in imple- menting aggression-prevention programs, and their knowledge and self-efficacy about prevention strategies, and their attitudes and beliefs about aggression, may be important determinants of the quality of implementa- tion.5 Teachers\xe2\x80\x99 personal involvement with aggression- prevention programs and the commitment from the school may also be associated with how frequently programs are implemented. In one middle school study, students who received more aggression-preven- tion lessons from their teachers were less likely to\nFrom the Department of Health Promotion and Behavior (Orpinas) and Department of Counseling and Human Development Services (Horne), University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia\nAddress correspondence and reprint requests to: Pamela Orpinas, PhD, Department of Health Promotion and Behavior, 319 Ramsey Center, The University of Georgia, Athens GA 30602.

Second, student aggression is not an isolated event. It occurs in a context that involves peers, teachers, administrators, and, in general, char- acteristics of the school environment. Modifying the school environment, including teachers\xe2\x80\x99 attitudes and behaviors, may be an important factor to consider in reducing aggression. On occasions, teachers who vic- timize students in the name of discipline may contrib- ute to student aggression.7 Most frequently, teachers can play a fundamental role in preventing bullying behavior.8,9 Third, students are not the only victims of aggression. Results from a national survey of public school teachers conducted in the 1999 \xe2\x80\x932000 academic year indicated that almost 10% of teachers had been threatened with injury, and 4% had been physically attacked by a student during the 12 months preceding the survey.10 In other words, almost 300,000 teachers are threatened and more than 125,000 are attacked each year. Fourth, helping students develop their social skills will also aid them with their academic skills. Students\xe2\x80\x99 lack of social competence and aggression is directly associated with low academic achievement.11 In addition, teachers frequently report that their students\xe2\x80\x99 disruptive behaviors keep them from teaching effective- ly.10,12 Thus, it is important for teachers to help stu- dents enhance their social skills. Finally, teachers often suffer from stress when trying to manage aggressive and disruptive students, which can lead to burnout and abandonment of the profession. Teachers frequently\n0749-3797/04/$\xe2\x80\x93see front matter 29 doi:10.1016/j.amepre.2003.09.016\n \n  Figure 1.

The goals of the GREAT Teacher Program are to increase teacher awareness of the problem of aggression in middle school schools, to reduce tolerance of aggression and bullying, to provide assistance to students who are the targets of aggression, to develop strategies to prevent aggression from occurring, and to improve teachers\xe2\x80\x99 management of aggressive behaviors when they do occur. The purpose of this paper is to describe the GREAT Teacher Program. This paper is composed of four sections. In the first section, the theoretical foundation of the program is examined. In the second section, previous programs that this program builds on are analyzed. The third section presents a detailed description of the different components of the program, and, finally, the last section discusses specific issues related to training, implementation, and supervision.\nTheoretical Background of the GREAT Teacher Program\nThe GREAT Teacher Program is based on an ecologic model used to explain the interplay of personal, socio- cultural, policy, and physical-environmental factors that may be associated with aggression.14 This multilevel approach, depicted in Figure 1, is used to describe the problem and to determine the array of interventions that are necessary to prevent and reduce aggression. The problem of school aggression, as well as its solu- tion, is conceptualized to be a function of contributions from several different levels of influence (top section of Figure 1). Although the GREAT Student Program15 focuses on the behaviors and cognitions of students and how they interact with their peers and teachers, and the GREAT Families Program16 focuses on the students\xe2\x80\x99 families, the GREAT Teacher Program focuses on the teachers and the school environment. Within the school, another ecologic model can be described, as presented in the bottom section of Figure 1. The model reflects the multiple factors within the school that may influence the problem and the feasibility of possible solutions. This model does not intend to minimize the factors outside the school setting that play a role in a teacher\xe2\x80\x99s ability to perform. However, it does focus on\n30 American Journal of Preventive Medicine, Volume 26, Number 1S\n Table 1.

Teachers develop creative strategies that will increase the probability of success among all students. Teachers analyze the connection between thoughts, feelings, and behavior and how negative thoughts about students may lead to negative expectations.\nTeachers apply a solution-focused approach to distinguish between problems they can solve and those that are out of their realm of influence; to distinguish between strategies that are helping to solve the problem and those that are not; and to develop better, constructive strategies. As before, the analysis of their thoughts, feelings, and behavior helps them use thoughts that will lead to constructive situations. To reduce their own stress, the use of support groups and stress management is emphasized.\nTeachers discuss how they may inadvertently reinforce negative behaviors. They practice using positive communication and how to avoid negative communication. Age-specific reinforcements are implemented.\nA drop box or other student-friendly reporting mechanisms are encouraged at each school.

The importance of positive relationships has been described in educational settings,17,18 in therapeutic relationships,19 and in familial relationships.20 Creating a positive and trusting relationship with students is also a core component of preventing bullying behavior, and it has been considered a prerequisite to all interven- tions.21 Teachers can learn specific techniques to han- dle behavior problems, but they are not likely to result in lasting change if they are not implemented in a positive classroom environment.\nIn addition to emphasizing the development of a positive relationship with students, strategies to prevent and reduce aggression are included. Key Social Cogni- tive Theory constructs (behavioral capability, self-effi- cacy, outcome expectations, emotional coping, rein- forcements, and environment) were translated into specific strategies to enhance teachers\xe2\x80\x99 management of behavioral problems,22,23 as described in Table 1.\nThe third body of literature on which this program is founded is the solution-focused approach to solving problems, which is based on William Glasser\xe2\x80\x99s Reality Therapy.24 Teachers learn to apply a step-by-step ap- proach to evaluate problem situations in their class- room and school. By focusing on the solution rather than the problem, and by focusing on future possibili- ties rather than the past, teachers are more likely to develop positive strategies for change.25\nIn order for teachers to enhance and apply the skills discussed in the workshop, they must receive continu- ous reinforcement and modeling of the new behav- iors,22 which is accomplished through teacher support groups. Several researchers have emphasized the im- portance of support groups after teacher training. Rohrbach et al.26 found that teacher level of implemen- tation was not related to whether the training was intensive or brief. They suggest that teacher training is necessary but not sufficient and that continuous train- ing or coaching may be more important than a one- time, pre-implementation training. Shapiro et al.27 reported that teachers with group support applied the\nAm J Prev Med 2004;26(1S) 31\n  Figure 2. Theoretical model for the GREAT Teacher Program.\nmaterial learned, whereas teachers who did not receive group support were less likely to incorporate the new material into their classroom management style. The Johns Hopkins Prevention Intervention Research Cen- ter has implemented several universal prevention trials since 1985, in which teachers have been involved directly in implementing the interventions. In one evaluation of a classroom-centered intervention di- rected to enhance the curriculum and improve behav- ior management practices, the researchers reported that teachers\xe2\x80\x99 behavior management practices were improved by weekly group meetings to solve prob- lems.28 Olweus29 has also emphasized the need for continuous support group meetings for teachers to help prevent bullying.\nFigure 2 identifies the complete theoretical model for the GREAT Teacher Program. The overall goal of the project is to reduce student aggression and inter- personal violence and to improve academic perfor- mance and social competence. In the classroom, the child is influenced by the teacher\xe2\x80\x99s personal character- istics for the prevention of aggression and management of the classroom. Both the children and the teacher create a specific type of classroom environment that\nalso influences their behavior. A child may act very differently in various types and sizes of classrooms, with different levels of supervision, or with teachers with different management styles. The classroom environ- ment is influenced by the overall school climate. Other factors that act as moderators of the efficacy of this program are teachers\xe2\x80\x99 general satisfaction with their role, their level of emotional exhaustion, their teach- ing experience, and their prior training in aggression prevention.\nDiscussion of Prior Programs\nThe GREAT Teacher Program is based on the work of two earlier promising prevention approaches\xe2\x80\x94ACT Early, a program designed to increase positive class- room management strategies,30 and Bully Busters, a program designed to increase teacher self-efficacy for handling bullies in the classroom.4\nACT (Addressing the Context of Teaching for Behav- iorally At-risk Young Students) Early is a 6-year longitu- dinal study that began in September 1996 (http:// www.coe.uga.edu/actearly/). Its overall goal is to advance the competency of elementary teachers to\n32 American Journal of Preventive Medicine, Volume 26, Number 1S\n intervene early in the behavioral and emotional prob- lems of students. Teacher professional development is centered on the behavioral assessment of children on multiple dimensions, technology-assisted decision mak- ing, and collaborative consultation methods. ACT Early was initially implemented in four elementary schools with 72 teachers and approximately 1600 students in kindergarten through third grade. At the end of the first 3 years, the program was expanded to include students in kindergarten through fifth grade in six elementary schools. The goals of the ACT Early pro- gram were to document individual, interactional, and environmental contributors to behavioral risk in ele- mentary school and to use this information to help teachers work more effectively with students at risk for poor behavior and low academic performance. This program demonstrated the effect teachers have on children at risk for behavioral, emotional, and aca- demic problems. In that study, the researchers identi- fied strategies to increase teachers\xe2\x80\x99 efficacy for working with at-risk children and to improve their classroom management and relationship skills, which affected their expectations for student learning. The study also provided evidence of the importance of ongoing teacher support groups.\nThe Bully Busters Program was established in 1994 to examine effective procedures for reducing bullying and aggression in middle schools. The program focused on changing the school climate by increasing teacher awareness of the problem of bullying and by providing training to manage bullying and victimization in the classroom and school environment. Two studies of the effect of Bully Busters showed that the program in- creased teachers\xe2\x80\x99 knowledge and use of bullying pre- vention skills, increased teachers\xe2\x80\x99 self-efficacy in work- ing with students, and reduced discipline referrals of students.4,31 The GREAT Teacher Program followed a training model similar to the Bully Busters Program, using a workshop followed by ongoing support groups to enhance teachers\xe2\x80\x99 relationships with students and to increase their classroom management skills and self- efficacy.\nThe current GREAT Teacher Program contains sev- eral aspects of the ACT Early and Bully Busters pro- grams, including an emphasis on changing the school environment by increasing teacher awareness and skills and by providing ongoing support to maintain change. The GREAT Teacher Program focuses more specifically on classroom management skills and on the impor- tance of a uniform application of teacher skills throughout the grade level and provides more in-depth training on some specific strategies than does the Bully Buster Program. The emphasis of the GREAT Teacher Program is not only to change teachers\xe2\x80\x99 skills, beliefs, and self-efficacy but also to produce a broader level of change in the classroom and in grade-level practices. Although teachers do not teach the student curricu-\nTable 2.

The 12-hour workshop is organized into five sections: an introduction and four modules (Table 2).\nAm J Prev Med 2004;26(1S) 33\nTeacher Workshop\nIntroduction. The workshop begins with an overview of the project, and in particular of the GREAT Student Program, followed by a discussion of the core values of the Teacher Program. These values are the basis for creating a positive school environment, and, without embracing the values, it may be difficult to promote lasting change. The first value of the program is that a successful classroom depends on teachers\xe2\x80\x99 having a positive relationship with their students. In the context of this workshop, a successful classroom refers to an environment in which aggressive behavior is least likely to occur and positive social behaviors are most likely to happen. A positive relationship has been considered a key element for implementing successful strategies to prevent and reduce aggression17,32 and for preventing substance abuse.33 A positive relationship between teachers and students fosters connectedness to the school, which is a protective factor against students\xe2\x80\x99 high-risk behaviors and a predictor of adolescent well- being.34 An important element of a positive relation- ship is to have high and realistic expectations for students.17\nThe second value, which is closely related to the first one, is that all members of a school community deserve to be treated with respect and dignity. Although it is easy to treat well-behaved students with respect and dignity, extending this attitude to problem students is sometimes a challenge. Teachers should also maintain their own self-respect when dealing with difficult stu- dents. When they respond with aggression, allowing the student to be in control, they are losing their self- respect and possibly losing the respect of their students.35\nThe third value is that bullying, aggression, and interpersonal violence are not acceptable in schools. Teachers need to demonstrate that they believe this value. Adult excuses for aggression like \xe2\x80\x9cBoys will be boys\xe2\x80\x9d and student excuses like \xe2\x80\x9cHe started it\xe2\x80\x9d are not acceptable. In many classrooms, we observe a parallel process: Students engage in inappropriate behavior such as yelling, and teachers, in turn, copy students and yell back at them. To stop these ineffective interactions, teachers must model appropriate skills. Because mod- eling is an important learning tool, teachers need to be able to model nonviolent solutions to conflict.22 Fre- quently, teachers have the opportunity to model how to respond to conflict without aggression, and this chal- lenge is addressed through this workshop. However, students learn how to respond without aggression in the GREAT Student Program15 and will be more tuned in to observing their teachers\xe2\x80\x99 behaviors.\nAt the end of the introduction, teachers describe their own school\xe2\x80\x99s values, for knowing these values is the first step in violence prevention. School values help teachers and administrators set rules and conse-\nquences, model strategies that are consistent with these values, and eliminate interventions that violate them.36\nModule 1. Aggression in schools: What is happening?\nThe objective of Module 1 is to increase awareness of the problem of aggression in schools. It focuses on the first two steps of the public health model.37 The first step is to define the problem by examining the preva- lence of the most common forms of physical, verbal, relational, and sexual aggression in schools. With the use of the ecologic model as a framework, the second step is to identify risk and protective factors at the student, school, family, and community levels.\nModule 2. Reflections: Developing long-term goals.\nThe purpose of Module 2 is to increase teachers\xe2\x80\x99 positive emotional coping responses and outcome ex- pectations about students. To accomplish this goal, three elements are included.\nFirst, teachers assess their classroom goals and deter- mine what is important to change and whether these changes are possible. This assessment is guided by a solution-focused approach, which is operationalized by five questions. The first question focuses on establish- ing goals, followed by examining personal and environ- mental characteristics related to the problem, evaluat- ing whether these characteristics promote or hinder those goals, defining new strategies to achieve the goals, and, finally, evaluating whether the new strate- gies help advance the goal. Teachers are encouraged to define goals and strategies over which they have some control, those within their sphere of influence.\nSecond, teachers examine personal characteristics that may influence the problem and, in particular, evaluate their thoughts, beliefs, and feelings about a situation and the consequent response. Understanding these thoughts may be an important mechanism for stopping or changing a negative thought process.38 \xe2\x80\x93 40 In addition to personal characteristics, teachers analyze the characteristics of the school that may influence the problem. This analysis is based on the ecologic model of the school (Figure 1).\nThe final part of Module 2 addresses how teachers can take care of their emotional and physical well- being. In particular, stress management and develop- ing a support network are presented as key elements for prevention of interpersonal violence in schools.35 Many stress management techniques are discussed and some are practiced. The need for a support network is accomplished partially by participating in the support groups.\nModule 3. Setting up for success: Preventive approach to reducing aggression. The goal of Module 3 is to enhance teachers\xe2\x80\x99 knowledge, skills, and self-efficacy to establish a classroom and school environment that prevents aggression. The prevention of aggression is based on the assumption that aggressive behaviors are\n34 American Journal of Preventive Medicine, Volume 26, Number 1S\n frequently the result of a sequence of events. For example, a physical fight between two boys may be traced back to name-calling that occurred the prior day. The name-calling may be traced to a conflict that occurred while completing a difficult task that the boys were assigned to do together, even though they would have preferred to work separately. Teachers are encour- aged to examine how possible sequences of events can be prevented through thoughtful classroom manage- ment. Teachers share successful and unsuccessful strat- egies for developing rules and routines, arranging the physical environment of the classroom, managing tran- sitions, and developing assessments and assignments that take into account individual characteristics of students. In addition, the values of the workshop are addressed again, and teachers are asked to analyze the effect of their classroom management style and teach- ing philosophy on the prevention of aggression. Teach- ers describe their style within a continuum from stu- dent-directed, to collaborative, to teacher-directed practices.41\nModule 4. Management of power struggles and aggres- sion. Even experienced teachers will have conflict in their classes. Despite the best prevention strategies, some students will be physically or verbally aggressive, and some will refuse to accept the consequences of that behavior. The goals of Module 4 are to enhance teachers\xe2\x80\x99 knowledge, skills, and self-efficacy to manage power struggles and aggression when they occur in the classroom and to help students who are the victims of such aggression. To provide a broad understanding of the problem of aggression, theories of youth aggression are discussed, including social learning theory and, in particular, the role of modeling,22 attribution theories and the aggressive attributional bias,42 and attachment theories with particular emphasis on the role that unsatisfactory and frustrating relationships with signif- icant others could have on aggression.43 However, the central component of this module is the application of skills to manage power struggles and aggression. The same strategy that is presented in the GREAT Student Program is used to help teachers manage student conflicts. An acronym to help organize the social\xe2\x80\x93 cognitive steps to stop or prevent aggression among students is introduced and explained (i.e., SCIDDLE for Stop, Calm down, Identify your choices, Decide among your choices, Do it, Look back, and Evaluate).44 Teachers are asked to display a poster with this acronym in their classroom to remind themselves and their students to use it when conflict arises. It is of particular importance to recognize and effectively handle power struggles with students (e.g., when a student says \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to, and you can\xe2\x80\x99t make me do it.\xe2\x80\x9d). Thus, specific strategies for diffusing power struggles are rehearsed.35 The final part of this module is to discuss strategies for helping students who are the victims of\nTable 3.

The teacher support groups are designed to rehearse and discuss alternative skills for violence prevention.\nSupport groups are a medium to develop creative ways of solving conflicts by incorporating the experiences and knowledge of the group and by using group members as problem-solving collaborators. As a consequence, the groups help build a stronger sense of team and cooperation.\nThe teacher groups are a source of support to help teachers handle daily stress related to teaching and classroom management.\nSome problems are not unique to single teachers but are related to general issues of school climate, discipline management by the administration. Support groups can help teachers develop a common understanding and an action plan to address these issues.\nTeachers review the violence- prevention skills taught in the student curriculum, discuss ways to reinforce those skills among students, and examine ways to help students apply them.\n GREAT, Guiding Responsibility and Expectations for Adolescents for Today and Tomorrow.\naggression, including the availability of a student- friendly reporting system.\nTeacher Support Groups\nAlthough the 2-day workshop provides information and specific content to enhance teachers\xe2\x80\x99 understanding and skills for reducing aggression in schools, the appli- cation of those skills can be mitigated by the stress and obligations teachers face day to day. Thus, to help sustain changes over time, support groups are con- ducted for teachers from the same school. Teachers are enriched by the sharing of different perspectives, par- ticularly in schools that have a heterogeneous group of teachers. This approach is also advantageous because teachers view their own classroom experiences and the experiences of other teachers as the most valuable source of in-service education.45\nThe goals of the teacher support groups are pre- sented in Table 3. Each support group is generally composed of two parts. The first part is devoted to examining the positive and negative experiences that teachers had during the prior weeks with the preven- tion of aggressive and disruptive behavior. For exam-\nAm J Prev Med 2004;26(1S) 35\nple, a teacher may explain a problem with a child who continues to tease another student. Because children rotate among different classes, other teachers may also have had a problem with the same child and may share how they handled it. Teachers brainstorm solutions to the problem and discuss which strategies were most effective and how to apply them. The second part of each support group is devoted to activities designed to reinforce key elements of the workshop and to discuss the implementation of teachers\xe2\x80\x99 own goals for the prevention of aggression.\nTraining, Implementation, and Supervision of the GREAT Teacher Program\nThe facilitators of the GREAT Teacher Program have graduate degrees in education, psychology, or counsel- ing and preferably have experience in the school setting. Educational experience is highly desired be- cause credibility and empathy with the teaching and administrative staff is considered so important it is almost a requirement for successful school program implementation. Facilitators from each site were trained on how to conduct the workshop and the support groups. The training included understanding and applying the principles of group dynamics, such as how teachers working together will develop better solutions than individual teachers; how groups provide a sense that the problems teachers face in the class- room are universal; and how participants can turn to the expertise of fellow educators to seek help, learn new skills, and develop effective methods of classroom management. Groups are particularly helpful for facil- itating problem solving through behavior rehearsals and role-playing that occur in the safety of a support group with fellow educators. The group setting pro- vides teachers with the opportunity to give feedback to one another about how they appear to be using com- munication skills, classroom management procedures, and school resources, such as counselors and parent interviews. Further, teachers observe the group leader demonstrate effective group process skills (e.g., end sidetracking, handle resistance, engage all members, develop a collegial relationship, and be positive).\nTo assure fidelity of implementation at all sites, several strategies were implemented. First, detailed manuals were developed to train the facilitators, to conduct the workshop, and to facilitate the support groups. The manuals include an extensive theoretical background; group management training; and a de- tailed, step-by-step description of implementation, in- cluding slides and activities. A manual for teachers, which contains the skills discussed in the workshop and their applications, was also developed. Second, all facilitators participated in a trainer\xe2\x80\x99s workshop and observed one teacher workshop conducted by the\nauthors before they implemented it at their sites. Third, weekly conference calls were used to assure quality implementation, to solve problems, and to provide support to facilitators. Detailed process evaluation forms were maintained to record the fidelity of imple- mentation and participants\xe2\x80\x99 program satisfaction.\nTeacher workshops were conducted either during school days (the project reimbursed the schools for substitute teachers) or during a weekend (the project paid the teachers for their time). Lunch and refresh- ments were provided. The workshops were conducted with teachers from different schools, and the exchange of information among teachers was highly valued. Because of financial constraints, only core academic teachers were invited to attend the program. To en- courage teacher participation, continuing education credits were given for attending the workshop and the support groups. For the program to be successful, however, teachers must see the value of the training, not only for the continuing education credits and money they receive but also as a practical method for preventing and stopping aggression.\nTeacher support groups, called the GREAT Groups, convened after the teacher workshop and were con- ducted in each school with teachers from only that school. Ten support groups, conducted every 2 to 3 weeks, were scheduled during the academic year. All sixth-grade teachers who participated in the 2-day work- shop were expected to attend the support groups, which were scheduled to last 60 to 90 minutes. Teach- ers who could not attend the workshop were invited to participate in the GREAT Groups from their school. Support groups were scheduled at a convenient time for teachers, usually after school or during a planning period. Teachers decided the support group schedule early in the school year according to their availability. Refreshments were provided at each group.\nConclusions\nEducators who are committed to children, aware of the problem of aggression in schools, and skilled on how to prevent and reduce these problem behaviors can have a powerful effect on the lives of children. Because of economic and educational trends in the last decades, however, teachers have had insufficient training and support for managing behavioral problems. Teachers are frequently pressured to increase academic perfor- mance and feel frustrated when they realize that, more often than they would like, they are forced to use their teaching time to manage problem behaviors. Because academic performance and behavior are frequently linked, reducing aggression and improving classroom behavior are likely to result in a more positive learning environment, which increases academic performance. Many teachers have expressed the need for more training to manage students\xe2\x80\x99 behavioral problems, and\n36 American Journal of Preventive Medicine, Volume 26, Number 1S\nthe GREAT Teacher Program may help fill this need. The program, which is based on a strong theoretical background, provides a step-by-step method to train teachers to reduce and prevent student aggression and problem behaviors in the classroom. In addition, sup- port groups help teachers consider differences among teachers, students, and social environments, as basic skills can easily be adapted to fit these differences. Because teachers are active participants in this process, they can easily embrace the solutions they have brain- stormed in the group.\nOne of the limitations of implementing the GREAT Teacher Program as part of a multisite research evalu- ation project was the need to limit the implementation of the program to core sixth-grade teachers only be- cause of financial constraints and the need to standard- ize the implementation across sites. Ideally, training of paraprofessionals, administrators, staff members, and all teachers from all grade levels may be a stronger approach to influencing the whole school environ- ment. However, a comprehensive, schoolwide ap- proach frequently has real-world constraints, which make it difficult to implement in a 1-year timeframe.46\nWe thank Tracy Elder, EdS, for the valuable and significant contributions she made in the development and implemen- tation of the GREAT Teacher Program.

aS'ES AND THEIR VICTIMS: UNDERSTANDING A PERVASIVE PROBLEM IN THE SCHOOLS\nGeorge M. Batsche & Howard M. Knoff (1994)\nSchool Psychology Review, 23, 165 \xe2\x80\x93 175.\n\nAbstract: School violence traditionally has been defined in terms of acts of assault, theft, and vandalism. However, a lesser but more frequent form of violence "bullying," affects 15% to 20% of all students in schools today. The National Education Goals Panel has identified creating school environments that are free from violence as one of the national goals. This goal cannot be achieved unless the issue of bullying is addressed directly by school systems in the United States. This article discusses the characteristics of bullies and their victims, school and family factors that affect the development of the bully/victim experience, and the school system responses to bullying. Finally, components of a comprehensive intervention plan for bullying are provided. \n\nIn response to the increasing concern over the issue of school safety, the National Education Goals Panel (1993) included as one of the six national education goals, "by the year 2000, every school in America will be free of drugs and violence and will offer a disciplined environment conducive to learning." School violence traditionally has been defined as acts of assault, theft, and vandalism. The definition of school violence has been limited to these behaviors because they are readily observable, generally reported, and easy to document. In addition, boards of education throughout the United States can develop policies (Codes of Conduct) and implement consequences (suspension/expulsion) more easily (and defensibly) when the definition is limited to observable and measurable offenses. Violence, however, should be defined more broadly to include any conditions or acts that create a climate in which individual students and teachers feel fear or intimidation in addition to being the victims of assault, theft, or vandalism. This latter description would include "bullying" in the definition of violence and greatly expand the discussion of violence and safety in the schools (Furlong & Morrison, this issue). \n"Bullying" is defined as a form of aggression in which one or more students physically and/or psychologically (and more recently, sexually) harass another student repeatedly over a period of time. Typically, the action is unprovoked and the bully is perceived as stronger than the victim (Hazier, Hoover, & Oliver, 1992; Olweus, 1991a). The purpose of this article is to: (a) present information on the incidence of bullying; (b) discuss the characteristics of bullies and their victims; (c) identify school and family factors related to bullying; (d) discuss the schools\' response to bullying; and (e) present possible intervention programs designed to improve the coping skills of students who are victims as well as to reduce the rate of aggression in bullies. \nINCIDENCE AND TRENDS\nThe majority of research on bullying has been conducted in Scandinavian countries (Olweus, 1973, 1978, 1984, 1991a, l991b), England (Boulton & Underwood, 1992; Stephenson & Smith, 1989) and Japan (Murakami, 1985). Although relatively little attention has been given to bullying in the United States, some studies have addressed the problem (Hazier, Hoover, & Oliver, 1992; Hoover, Oliver, & Hazler, 1992; Perry, Kusel, & Perry, 1988; Perry, Williard, & Perry, 1990). Olweus (1991a, 1978) reported that about 15% of Norwegian school students were involved in bully/victim problems "now and then." In two separate studies involving elementary and secondary students in England, Stephenson and Smith (1989) and Lane (1989) reported that approximately 23% of children and adolescents experienced bullying. \nSimilar results have been obtained in the United States. In a 1984 study by the National Association of Secondary School Principals, it was reported that 25% of students surveyed stated that one of their most serious concerns was "fear of bullies." Perry, Kusel, and Perry (1988) reported that about 10% of their sample of American students could be characterized as "extreme victims" of bullying. However, Hoover, Oliver, and Hazler (1992) reported that approximately 75% of the adolescent students participating in their study answered "yes" to the question, "have you ever been bullied during your school years?" This statistic would overrepresent the problem of bullying when the criterion of "repeated" incidence (see definition of bullying earlier in this article) is applied. In a special report for the National Education Goals Panel, Johnston, O\'Malley, and Bachman (1993) of the University of Michigan\'s Institute for Social Research reported that 29% of 8th graders were threatened without a weapon and 19% were threatened with a weapon at school during the 1992 school year. Clearly, a great deal of similarity exists across students and countries in the percentages of students reporting experiences with bullying. A statement that 15% to 20% of all students will experience some form of bullying during their school years is certainly supported by the literature. Therefore, bullying may be the most prevalent form of violence in the schools and the form that is likely to affect the greatest number of students. \nIs student victimization increasing? Olweus (199lb) suggests that bullying takes on more serious forms and occurs more frequently than it did 10 to 15 years ago in Norway. Johnston, O\'Malley, and Bachman (1993) report an increase, from 19% in 1980 to 25% in 1992, in the percentage of 12th graders in the United States threatened without a weapon. The majority of the increase took place between 1980 and 1985 and the figures have remained quite stable during the past 7 years. Whether or not there is an increase in student victimization, the fact that one in five students is at-risk for victimization is cause for serious concern and action on the part of school personnel. \nVictimization by students is not limited to other students. Johnston, O\'Malley and Bachman (1993) reported that 28% of public school teachers were verbally abused, 15% threatened with injury, and 3% physically attacked by students during the 1991 school year. Although teachers (and parents, for that matter) may not fit the "physically weaker" profile of the typical peer victim, bullies nonetheless will intimidate those who they believe can not, or will not, retaliate or those with whom they have been successful in bullying in the past. As will be seen later in this article, many bullies come from environments where they have been successful in bullying adults for personal gain, to establish a positive reputation with their peers, or to escape an undesirable situation. \nCHARACTERISTICS OF BULLIES AND VICTIMS\nDevelopment of a Bully \nEvidence suggests that bullying is "intergenerational" and that a bully at school is a victim at home (Floyd, 1985; Greenbaum, 1988). Bullies come from homes where parents: (a) prefer physical means of discipline (authoritarian); (b) are sometimes hostile and rejecting; (c) are described as both hostile and permissive (inconsistent parenting/little supervision); (d) have poor problem-solving skills; and (e) teach their children to strike back at the least provocation (Floyd, 1985; Greenbaum, 1988; Loeber & Dishion, 1984). Olweus (1991a) reports that bullies are often characterized by impulsivity, a strong need to dominate others, and have little empathy with victims. However, he found no indications that bullies are anxious, insecure, or lack self-esteem. Perhaps this is the case because bullies report that they "like" being a bully and perceive their actions as justified (Greenbaum,1988). They are reinforced for their actions through both positive reinforcement (goal attainment) and negative reinforcement (removal of threat) paradigms. Bullying is all about control. When they are in control bullies feel more secure and less anxious. Unfortunately, that security is at the expense of their victims. In general, bullies can be described as having aggressive behavior profiles combined with physical strength (Olweus, 1991b). Aggressive boys are confident of achieving success through their aggression, are unaffected by the possibility of inflicting pain and suffering, and process information about victims in a rigid and automatic fashion (Perry, Kusel, & Perry, 1988). Bullies believe that they pick on their victim because they are provoked or because they do not like the victim. When asked how they feel when they bullied other children, the most common responses were that they felt good/happy or that they felt mad or angry (Boulton & Underwood, 1992). \nFollow-up studies of bullies do not paint a positive picture. Olweus (1991) reported that approximately 60% of boys identified as bullies in Grades 6-9 had at least one conviction at the age of 24 and that 35% to 40% had three or more convictions. This was true of only 10% of the control group. By comparison, Olweus also noted that former victims had an average of below average level of criminality in early adulthood. Eron, Huesmann, Dubow, Romanoff, and Yarnel (1987), in a sample of students in the United States, reported that bullies identified early in school had a one-in-four chance of having a criminal record by age 30. Olweus (1991a) also noted that former victims had an average or below average level of criminality in early adulthood. \nVictims \nOlweus (1973, 1978) identified two types of victims: the passive victim and the provocative victim. Passive victims are described as anxious, insecure, appearing to do nothing to provoke attacks, and appearing not to defend themselves. Provocative victims are described as hot-tempered, restless, and anxious, and ones who will attempt to retaliate when attacked. Perry et al. (1988) identified victims in a similar manner, using the terms "high-aggressive" and "low-aggressive victims." However, Perry et al. (1988) found that the probability of a victim being provocative or passive was approximately equal whereas Olweus (1984) reported fewer than one in five victims as provocative. \nOlweus describes the passive victim as lonely and abandoned at school, often without friends. They are not aggressive, do not tease, and are likely (if boys) to be physically weaker than same-age peers. Results of parent interviews suggest that these boys were sensitive at a young age and have closer contact and more positive relations with their parents (particularly their mothers) than boys in general. Teachers identify these children as overprotected by parents. The majority of victims believe that they are picked on because they are smaller, weaker, or for no reason at all (Boulton & Underwood, 1992). Few believe that they provoked the bully. In addition, the vast majority of victims believe that bullies feel good, happy, brilliant, or clever when they pick on a victim. \nPerry et al. (1988) have investigated the relationship between victimization, aggression, and peer rejection. They found aggression and victimization were orthogonal dimensions. That is, some of the most extreme victims also were some of the most aggressive children in their sample. Perry and colleagues (1988) suggest that victims constitute a heterogeneous group and can be categorized in the following manner: victimized/rejected, aggressive/ rejected, and victimized/aggressive/rejected. The victimized/rejected child would reflect Olweus\' "passive victim" profile while the victimized/aggressive/ rejected would reflect the "provocative victim" profile. As Perry et al. (1988) suggest, the victimized/aggressive/rejected student might aggress against weaker children but then be victimized by stronger, aggressive peers. This would explain the fact that some of the most extreme victims in their sample also were some of the most aggressive students. \nClearly, it is necessary to understand the type of victim one is working with in order to implement successful interventions. If one views all victims as passive and weak, then strategies such as assertiveness training and presenting a stronger visual profile might be recommended. However, the provocative victims would require strategies designed to reduce aggressive behaviors (e.g., interpreting hostile bias) as well as strategies to use more assertive/less aggressive solutions to threats (Dodge, Coie, Pettit, & Price, 1990). These highly aggressive/ victimized students are among the most disliked members of the peer groups and are at risk for later adjustment problems. Perry and colleagues (1988) caution that the form and seriousness of the problems associated with peer rejection may depend on the ability of school personnel to accurately identify the type of rejection that the student is experiencing. \nVictimization is generally unrelated to most physical characteristics of children. In two separate studies, Olweus (1973, 1978) demonstrated that the only physical characteristic related to victimization was physical strength. No other physical characteristics were associated with victim status. Weaker children were more likely to be victims and bullies were more likely to be physically stronger (than their victims). Students who are fat, red-haired, wear glasses, speak in an unusual dialect, dress differently and the like were no more likely to be victims than other students without these characteristics. \nGender Differences \nThe general trend is for boys both to bully and be bullied more than girls. Victims report that about 65% of bullying is perpetrated by boys, 15% by girls, and 19% by boys and girls (Boulton & Underwood, 1992). In a recent Olweus (1991a) study, more than 60% of girls bullied in grades 5-7 were bullied by boys only and an additional 15 to 20% were bullied by both boys and girls. More than 80% of victimized boys are bullied by boys. The type of bullying varies according to gender as well. Boy bullies are three to four times more likely to inflict physical assaults than girl bullies (Eron, Huesmann, Dubow, Romanoff, & Yamel, 1987), whereas girls use more ridicule and teasing (Hoover, Oliver, & Hazler, 1992). Olweus has labeled open attacks as direct bullying and social isolation and exclusion from the group as indirect bullying. Boys are more likely to employ direct bullying. \nSCHOOL FACTORS AND THE EFFECTS OF BULLYING\nSchool Variables \nResearchers in England and Scandinavian countries have investigated the relationship between rate of bullying and school size, class size, ethnic mix, and socioeconomic levels. Results of these studies indicate that no positive relationship exists between the relative frequency or level of bully/victim problems and the size of the school or the size of the class (Olweus, 1991a; Whitney & Smith, 1993). The size of the schools ranged from 100 to 1,200 students and the class size from 18 to 31 students. In addition, there is no relationship between the proportion of white/nonwhite students and the frequency of bullying behavior (Whitney & Smith, 1993). Whitney and Smith (1993) reported a significant negative correlation between socioeconomic status of the families that the school serves and the frequency of bullying in junior/middle schools. To date, no studies report similar comparisons for schools in the United States. However, the average school size, class size, and percent of students by ethnic group in the Whitney and Smith study were very similar to that of schools in the United States. \nAge/Grade Trends \nThe percentage of students bullied decreases significantly with age and grade. The rate of decline is less during junior high and high school. Olweus (1991) reports that the average percentage of students bullied was 11.6% in grades 2 through 6 and 5.4% in grades 7 through 9. More than 50% of students in the lowest grades were bullied by older students whereas older children are bullied primarily by same-age peers (Boulton & Underwood, 1992; Olweus, 1991). However, it is the youngest students in a particular school setting (regardless of age) who are most at risk for being bullied. This is logical given the fact that the younger students in a building are usually physically weaker and more vulnerable than older, stronger students. There is a general decline in direct, physical bullying as age/grade increases while the relatively higher level of verbal abuse/aggression remains constant (Boulton & Underwood, 1992; Perry, Kusel, & Perry, 1988). Specifically, Perry et al. (1988) report nearly equal physical and verbal (15 verbal, 16 physical) Peer Nomination Inventory (PNI) victimization scores for males at grade 3 with a significant reduction in the physical victimization score at grade 6 (15 verbal, 9 physical) on the PNI. \nEffects of Bullying \nIt is logical to assume that victims of bullying would be fearful and anxious in the environment in which the bullying took place. These victims might respond with avoidance/withdrawn/escape behaviors (skipping school, avoiding places at school, running away/suicide), more aggressive behaviors (such as bringing a weapon to school for self-defense or retaliation), and poor academic performance. It is important to remember that Perry et al. (1988) identified different types of victims and that the effects of bullying would differ as a function of victim type. \nAvoidance and withdrawal behaviors are likely to occur in the victims of bullies. The presence of a bully at school creates a climate of fear and intimidation for the individual victims of that bully, regardless of how pervasive the problem is. Students who are chronic victims of even mild abuse are likely to view school as an unhappy setting (Gilmartin, 1987) and are likely to avoid places within the school setting or the school completely. Data from the 1992 school year (Johnston, O,Malley, & Bachman, 1993) indicated that 16% of 8th graders felt unsafe at school some or most of the time and 7% of 8th graders did not go to school during the previous month because they felt unsafe at school. Even greater numbers of students take precautions while at school in order to insure their own safety. Twenty percent "stay away from certain places in school," 22% "stay away from certain places on school grounds," and 8% "stay away from school related events." Although not completely responsible for creating a school climate that students strive to avoid, bullying contributes to the serious problem of making school a place to be feared for many students. Effective schooling can not occur under conditions of intimidation and fear. \nIn the Violent Schools-Safe Schools report (National Institute of Education, 1978), 56% of assault victims reported being afraid at school "sometimes" and 15% of the attack victims reported staying home "sometimes" out of fear of being hurt. In addition, 29% of victims reported that they occasionally brought weapons to school when only 9% of other students did so. Nine percent of 8th graders and 10% of 10th graders reported bringing a weapon (gun, knife, or club) to school at least once in the previous month. In extreme cases, students have committed suicide as a result of bullying or have killed the bully (Greenbaum, 1988). These data support the notion that fear for one\'s safety in school results in skipping school, avoiding areas of school, or engaging in illegal activities (weapons at school) in significant numbers. Almost one in five students reported having either no, one, or two friends at school, indicating that many victims have few peer-level resources for either problem solving or support. When a condition exists in which students fear for their safety (or their lives) and feel that they have little or no peer and/or teacher support, it is not surprising that an increase in school avoidance, in the number of weapons, and in both self-directed and interpersonal aggression is seen in the school setting. \nAlthough the impact of bullying on academic performance is less well understood, it would be logical to assume that the effects of skipping school, avoiding school-related activities, and fear for one\'s safety would be detrimental to academic progress. There is some evidence to support this position. Hazler, Hoover, and Oliver (1992) reported that 90% of students who were bullied stated that they experienced a drop in school grades. Olweus (1978) found that victims (boys) of bullying had somewhat lower grades than their peers. Perry, Kusel, and Perry (1988) found a significant, negative correlation between intelligence and level of victimization for males. \nResponse of School Personnel to Bullying \nThe response of school personnel to bullying is, at best, disappointing. Results of research conducted at different times and in different countries, provide a similar picture. More than 60% of the victims report that school personnel respond poorly, respond only"sometimes or never," or try to put a stop to the bullying "only once in a while or almost never" (Boulton & Underwood, 1992; Hoover, Oliver, & Hazler, 1992; Olweus, 1991a). It is clear that school personnel do relatively little to intervene in the bullying cycle at school. There may be a number of reasons for this. \nFirst, Stephenson and Smith (1988) report that 25% of teachers feel that it is sometimes helpful to ignore the problem. Because bullying often occurs in the form of verbal intimidation, isolation, and exclusion, teachers may view these behaviors as less serious than physical assaults where the "damage" is easily visible. Second, the social (passive) skills of the victims may be such that teachers are less motivated to intervene. Third, the behavior of the victim may play an important role as well. Boulton and Underwood (1992) reported that the effect size for the correlation between reported victimization and intervention by teachers was less than the reported frequency of bullying and intervention by teachers. This suggests that the child who is bullied will get less attention from adults than the child who bullies. Interviews with victims indicate that children who do not tell do so out of fear of reprisal. If this is the case, then victims might perceive that teachers and other school personnel either will not be sympathetic to their plight or will not be able to protect them. \nThe majority of the research cited throughout in this article was consistent in stating that in order for bullying to be reduced significantly, schools must send a strong message to students and staff that bullying is inappropriate. Students are quick to indict school personnel for their failure to act both to protect victims and to deal effectively with bullies (Hazier, Hoover, & Oliver, 1992). Victims of bullies already believe that they are "victims" of their peers (the bullies). If these students also believe that they are victims of the system through the lack of protection and support by the school staff, then one can understand more clearly why students resort to avoidance and/or retaliation. It is clear that schools must promote the idea that adults will be supportive of victims and that school officials can provide a safe haven for all students while at school. \nSCHOOL-BASED INTERVENTIONS FOR BULLYING\nAlthough few studies have been designed to evaluate the effects of intervention programs to reduce bullying (Olweus, 1991a) at a building-and district-level, most are anecdotal reports with limited outcome data. School-based intervention programs must seek to integrate strategies gleaned from research on topics that include organizational change, effective parent involvement, behavioral programs for students with aggressive and/or withdrawn behavior profiles, group counseling for perpetrators and victims, and effective building-based discipline procedures. In May 1987, a "Schoolyard Bully Practicum," sponsored by the National School Safety Center, was held at Harvard University to develop a prevention program for the United States. A wide range of strategies were identified to help educators and others control and prevent bullying. It was clear that the development of a comprehensive, integrated plan that could be implemented by school buildings across the United States was necessary in order to achieve the control and prevention of bullying. Many researchers and practitioners (Coie, Underwood, & Lochman, 1991; Dubow, Huesmann, & Eron, 1987; Floyd, 1985; Goldstein, 1988; Goldstein & Glick, 1987; Goldstein, Sprafkin, Gershaw, & Klein, 1980; Greenbaum, 1987, 1988; Guetzloe, 1992; Hazler, Hoover, & Oliver, 1992; Olweus, 1991b) have suggested a variety of district-, building-, classroom-, and student-level interventions. What follows is a set of recommended strategies and components necessary to construct a comprehensive plan to control and prevent bullying in schools. \n1. Promote facts, not myths, about bullying. Bullying is a significant and pervasive problem in America\'s schools. Fear has become a significant factor in the school behavior of many (15% to 20% students. Evidence exists that truancy, avoidance of school activities and peers, possible academic difficulties, and in extreme cases, suicide are linked to bullying. Films and videos are available for use with students and professional staff that can facilitate the promotion of accurate information. \n2. Dispel beliefs about aggressive behavior. The prevailing attitude that fighting and other forms of aggressive behavior are a normal part of "growing up" must be discarded. Schools must promote the belief that this type of behavior is completely unacceptable, develop policies and programs to deal effectively and quickly with aggression, and teach students alternatives to aggression. \n3. Conduct a school-wide assessment of bullying. Schools must determine how pervasive the bully problem is, the attitudes and beliefs of bullies and victims, the perception of students regarding how well the school handles bullying, and what students believe should be done. Olweus (1978, 1984) developed a direct assessment device for his research and Perry and colleagues (1988) developed a peer nomination procedure to assess the nature of bullying within student groups. 4. Develop a student code of conduct. Most schools have an existing code of conduct. However, students should participate in the development of the code that includes provisions to deal with bullying. The code should specify both appropriate and inappropriate relationships between students/students and students/faculty. The majority of school codes of conduct specify only inappropriate behaviors and do not include student involvement in their development. \n5. Provide counseling cervices for bullies and victims. Counseling services are most effective when there is an emphasis on the development of skills to replace aggressive behaviors with more appropriate ones or to replace avoidance/withdrawn behaviors with more assertive ones. The use of group social skills training is the intervention of choice (see Goldstein, 1988). \n6. Involve parents in the intervention process. The school usually involves the parents of the bully when disciplinary action is required, such as suspension or expulsion. Few schools routinely involve the parents of victims or the parents of bullies for purposes other than discipline. Some schools have adopted a "10 Day/lO Minute Suspension" program designed to encourage the parents\' involvement in interventions for bullies. In this program, the length of the student\'s suspension is dependent on whether or not the parents will become involved with school personnel in an intervention program. The earlier the parents become involved, the shorter the suspension. Parents often have the same problems with their children at home that teachers have with the child in school. Therefore, involving parents in parent education, teaching parenting and child management skills, and linking home and school intervention programs are desirable components of a comprehensive plan. \n7. Implement intervention strategies specific to aggressive children. Approaches to intervention with aggressive students and their victims fall into five general categories: (a) behavior management; (b) self-control strategies; (c) social skills training; (d) information processing; and (e) cognitive perspective taking (Coie, Underwood, & Lochman, 1991). Larson (this issue) provides a critical review of intervention programs for aggressive students. How intervention programs are implemented is as important as the particular programs selected. Bullying is an interpersonal act conducted within a social setting. For that reason, interventions designed to reduce the bullying behavior and increase prosocial behavior should be implemented in a group setting and in a consistent manner. Intervention programs targeted at bully behavior should be implemented building wide, with all school staff (instructional, administrative, support, cafeteria, custodial, bus) trained to implement preventative and intervention strategies. This building wide strategy will facilitate generalization of both the intervention strategies and the effects of those strategies on student behavior. In addition, the building-wide program should be a multifaceted intervention process (Dubow, Huesmann, & Eron, 1987) that addresses the multiple components recommended by Coie, Underwood, and Lochman (1991). \n8. Accountability and evaluation. Teachers and students alike should be informed, on a regular basis, of the effects of the comprehensive schoolwide plan. A schoolwide tracking system should document the frequency of bully/victim problems (such as behavior referrals to the office, suspensions/expulsions) and these data should be reported to teachers and students monthly. Bullies and victims should be identified and included in intervention programs on a continuing basis. Teachers and students should be encouraged to set specific goals designed to reduce the rate of aggressive behavior while increasing the rate of prosocial behavior. Unless data routinely are provided to teachers and students, the true picture of a bully problem will not emerge. When this happens, the sensitivity of the students and staff to the problem will diminish and the motivation to support intervention programs will decline. Conversely, if the students and staff do receive data on the effectiveness of the intervention programs they are implementing, then the motivation to continue these programs will increase. \nSummary \nThe available evidence indicates that the incidence of bullying is not decreasing and some evidence suggests that it is increasing. In either event, this is a problem that affects (with varying degrees of severity) 15% to 20% of the students in the United States, the absolute number of which is staggering. The effects of bullying contribute substantially to the development of an unsafe environment in schools and to a decline in the academic and social performance of students involved in bully/victim experiences. The number of students who are victims of assault, theft, and vandalism are few in number compared to those who are involved in bully/victim experiences. If school systems choose to limit interventions only to assaults, theft, and vandalism -- and limit interventions to these problems alone -- then little will be done to develop the school as a "safe haven" for students. \nThe presence of bullying in a school indicates that the level of prosocial behavior and respect for one another is lacking. The research cited in this article supports the concept that students are poorly equipped to respond to bullies and that those same students believe that the adults in the school environment do little to discourage bullying. In essence, the belief of bullies that they can use power and intimidation to control their environment and the lack of response by school personnel results in the creation of an environment where few would want to spend their day. Whether bullying occurs in the form of physical aggression, intimidation in a power struggle, sexual harassment, ridicule, or teasing, the bottom line is that students are unable to demonstrate appropriate interpersonal skills and fear the environment they are in. Bullying is always inappropriate. The environment will change and the climate improve only when school systems choose to develop and implement a comprehensive plan designed to teach prosocial behavior, to limit aggressive behavior, and to teach skills that promote positive interactions between students. More importantly, however, school personnel must recognize that the problem is pervasive, that it contributes to the decline in academic and social progress of students, and that a comprehensive intervention plan must be implemented by the entire staff, throughout the school setting. Until then, however, bullies will continue to roam the halls of our nation\'s schools, unchecked and in control. \n\n\nAddress correspondence about this manuscript to George M.

Bullying and being bullied have been recognized as health problems for children because of their association with adjustment problems, including poor mental health and more extreme violent behavior. It is therefore important to understand how bullying and being bullied affect the well-being and adaptive functioning of youth. We sought to use multiple data sources to better understand the psychological and social problems exhibited by bullies, victims, and bully- victims.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants. Analysis of data from a community sample of 1985 mostly Latino and black 6th graders from 11 schools in predominantly low socioeconomic status urban communities (with a 79% response rate).\nMain Outcome Measures. Peer reports of who bullies and who is victimized, self-reports of psychological dis- tress, and peer and teacher reports of a range of adjust- ment problems.\nResults. Twenty-two percent of the sample was clas- sified as involved in bullying as perpetrators (7%), vic- tims (9%), or both (6%). Compared with other students, these groups displayed school problems and difficulties getting along with classmates. Despite increased conduct problems, bullies were psychologically strongest and en- joyed high social standing among their classmates. In contrast, victims were emotionally distressed and so- cially marginalized among their classmates. Bully-vic- tims were the most troubled group, displaying the high- est level of conduct, school, and peer relationship problems.\nConclusions. To be able to intervene with bullying, it is important to recognize the unique problems of bullies, victims, and bully-victims. In addition to addressing these issues directly with their patients, pediatricians can recommend school-wide antibullying approaches that aim to change peer dynamics that support and maintain bullying.

Indeed, emotional bullying by peers is espe- cially a concern for youth,8 and recent school shoot- ings suggest that it is not physical abuse by peers but inability to cope with social ridicule and personal rejection that can fuel extreme outbursts of violence.9\nLarge-scale US studies on bullying and victimiza- tion have relied mainly on self-reports when identi- fying bully/victim groups and assessing their adjust- ment problems, and none that we know of have combined assessments from the perspective of youth, their peers, and their teachers. Studies that rely solely on self-reports suggest that bullies, vic- tims, and bully-victims all share psychosocial adjust- ment difficulties such as depression and psychoso- matic problems.2\xe2\x80\x93 4 Despite showing a rather uniform picture of these 3 groups in some studies, other in- vestigations have found differences: compared with victims, bullies are more likely to manifest defiant behavior4 \xe2\x80\x93 6,9 and negative attitudes toward school2,5 and use drugs.5 Victims, in turn, report feeling more insecure and lonely than bullies.2,10 There is less information on bully-victims, although this group seems to display the most severe problems.2,4,5 Un- derstanding the characteristics of these groups is important for identification and intervention.\nHowever, there is concern that youth involved in bullying may not accurately self-identify and that others, namely their classmates, would provide a more accurate assessment of who is involved in bul- lying, and their teachers can provide important in- formation about their adjustment. Indeed, if only some youth accurately self-identify as bullies or vic- tims, reports of their mental health could mislead efforts to develop interventions to address their needs.\nTherefore, we conducted a study that included all 3 perspectives: self-, peer, and teacher reports. Most importantly, we relied on classmates to report which\nPEDIATRICS Vol. 112 No. 6 December 2003 1231 Downloaded from by guest on April 20, 2017\nstudents were involved in bullying, because they have ample opportunities to observe peers\xe2\x80\x99 behavior in situations where bullying is most likely to take place (ie, when adult supervision is absent or mini- mal). Specifically, we used a labor-intensive peer nomination methodology that is rarely used in such large studies: each student provides confidential re- ports on which classmates bully others and which are victims of bullying. Individual nominations are then combined to determine the strength of reputa- tions. Peer nominations have been found to be very reliable over time and predictive of a variety of de- velopmental outcomes.11\xe2\x80\x9313 For example, one study showed that peer nominations for negative charac- teristics (such as those describing bullying) in 3rd grade predicted psychiatric problems 11 to 13 years later better than any other traditional predictors (eg,\n14 teacher ratings, self-reports, or achievement data).\nWe used our data to compare self-reported psy- chological distress, peer-reported social adaptation, and teacher-rated adjustment of bullies, victims, bul- ly-victims, and youth uninvolved in bullying. We also focused on a demographic population of stu- dents who are considered at risk for violence: youth in predominantly urban, low-income communities with a high representation of Latino and black youth.15 With one exception, large-scale studies have not included these 2 racial/ethnic groups.5 To our knowledge, the current study is the largest investi- gation on bullying and victimization among ethically diverse urban adolescents.\nMETHODS\nStudy Design\nWe conducted a study of bullying among 6th-grade students in 11 public middle schools in the greater metropolitan area of Los Angeles. All the schools were in low-income communities and qualified for Title I compensatory education funds. Student eligi- bility for free or reduced-price lunch programs ranged from 47% to 87%. Three of the schools consisted primarily of black students, 3 were mostly Latino, and 5 had no majority group.\nThe study does not include students in special education, lim- ited English proficiency, and gifted-student programs. Parental permission was required; consent forms were sent home with students in English and Spanish. The return rate for all schools was 78%; 90% of returned forms granted permission. Students provided assent. As part of the assent procedure, students were assured confidentiality.\nThe final sample consisted of 1985 students (mean age: 11.5 years, 46% male). The racial/ethnic distribution was 45% Latino, 26% black, 10% white, 11% Asian, and 8% other.\nData Collection\nData were collected from 11 schools in 4 school districts split over the fall of 2000 and the fall of 2001. Research team members conducted the data collection. Self-administered student surveys took  1 hour to complete. Teachers who had daily contact with a class rated students\xe2\x80\x99 social behavior and academic engagement. The survey and procedures were approved by the University of California Los Angeles Human Subjects Protection Committee and the school districts.\nMeasures and Variables\nBullies and Victims\nWe classified youth involved in bullying with categories devel- oped in prior studies.2,3,5 We used peer nominations whereby students listed up to 4 classmates from a class roster who fit descriptions for bullying (\xe2\x80\x9cstarts fights and pushes other kids\naround,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cputs down and makes fun of others,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cspreads nasty rumors about others\xe2\x80\x9d) and victimization (\xe2\x80\x9cgets pushed around,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cis put down or made fun of,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cabout whom nasty rumors are spread\xe2\x80\x9d). The 3 bullying nominations received were strongly correlated (Cronbach\xe2\x80\x99s     0.90) and were therefore summed for each student. The same was true for the 3 victimiza- tion nominations (    0.87). The total nominations received for each then were standardized within classrooms. We used cutoff values from prior research to classify students into the bully/ victim groups.16 Students who fell 0.5 standard deviations above the sample mean on bully nominations and below the sample mean on victim nominations were classified as \xe2\x80\x9cbullies\xe2\x80\x9d; students whose victim nominations were 0.5 standard deviations above the sample mean and whose bully nominations fell below the mean were classified as \xe2\x80\x9cvictims\xe2\x80\x9d; and students whose peer nomina- tions for bullying and victimization were both 0.5 standard devi- ations above the mean were identified as \xe2\x80\x9cbully-victims.\xe2\x80\x9d We identified nonaggressive, nonvictimized youth (\xe2\x80\x9cuninvolved\xe2\x80\x9d) as those falling below the sample mean on both bully and victim nominations. The rest of the sample was classified as \xe2\x80\x9cborderline.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAs with any research that uses cutoff scores to categorize participants into groups, it is important to determine if specific cutoff values affect the findings. Therefore, we also conducted sensitivity analyses using different cutoffs.\nSelf-Reported Psychological Distress\nWe used 3 indicators of self-reported psychological distress. 1) Depression was measured with the 10-item Children\xe2\x80\x99s Depres- sion Inventory Short Form.17 For each of the 10 items, respondents were asked to choose the option that best described how they had been feeling during the past 2 weeks (eg, \xe2\x80\x9cI do most things right,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI do many things wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cI do everything wrong\xe2\x80\x9d). Item scores (range: 0 \xe2\x80\x932) were summed (    0.80). 2) Social anxiety was assessed with a combination of 2 subscales (12 items,     0.82) from the Social Anxiety Scale for Adolescents18 measuring fear of negative evaluation (eg, \xe2\x80\x9cI worry about what others think of me\xe2\x80\x9d) and social avoidance (eg, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid to invite others to do things with me because they might say no\xe2\x80\x9d). Each of the 12 items were rated on a 5-point scale from \xe2\x80\x9cnot at all\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9call the time.\xe2\x80\x9d 3) A 16-item loneliness measure19 (eg, \xe2\x80\x9cI feel alone\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cI have nobody to talk to\xe2\x80\x9d) had a 5-point scale from \xe2\x80\x9cnot true at all\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9calways true.\xe2\x80\x9d Scores were averaged (    0.85).\nPeer Reports of Adjustment\nPeer nominations were used to assess social adaptation within the peer group. Respondents nominated up to 4 classmates they considered the \xe2\x80\x9ccoolest\xe2\x80\x9d kids in their class (indicating social status or rank) and up to 4 they did not like to hang out with (indicating avoidance). We included the question about social avoidance (also called peer rejection), because high social rank does not preclude classmates from avoiding a student. Nominations received were summed for each student and standardized within classroom.\nTeacher-Rated Adjustment\nTeachers with daily classroom contact rated students on behav- ior by using 11 interpersonal competence items with a 7-point scale with item-specific anchors (eg, \xe2\x80\x9cnever sad\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9calways sad\xe2\x80\x9d).20 These items yielded 3 subscales with 3 items each: inter- nalizing problems (sad, worries, cries a lot;     0.61); conduct problems (starts fights, argues, gets in trouble;     0.89); and popularity (popular with boys, popular with girls, has lots of friends;     0.79).\nTeachers also rated school engagement with 6 items from the Teacher Report of Engagement Questionnaire21 (eg, \xe2\x80\x9cin my class this student concentrates on doing his/her work\xe2\x80\x9d). Ratings were on 4-point scales (\xe2\x80\x9cnot at all characteristic of this student\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cvery characteristic\xe2\x80\x9d). Item scores were averaged (    0.89). For the analyses, we reverse-coded this measure such that it indicates problems similar to most of the other variables; we relabeled it as disengagement from school.\nStatistical Methods\nThe differences among the bully/victim groups regarding psy- chosocial distress, social adjustment, and school engagement were analyzed by using analyses of variance with SPSS. Statistically\n1232 BULLYING AMONG YOUNG ADOLESCENTS\nDownloaded from by guest on April 20, 2017\nsignificant group differences (P   .01) were followed up with pairwise comparisons (Tukey test, significant difference: P   .05). To facilitate the interpretation of group differences in measures from multiple informants and with different response scales, all the variables were converted into standard scores with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. As standardized scores, the means portrayed in Figs 1, 2, and 3 can also be interpreted as percentiles: Values of 0 are at the 50th percentile; positive scores are above the 50th percentile; and negative scores are below the 50th percentile. Scores of 1 represent approximately the 85th percentile. The scales for y axes vary across self-, peer, and teacher reports to best depict the relative differences among the 5 groups within each data\nsource.\nRESULTS Classification of Bully/Victim Groups\nStudents were classified as bullies (7%), bully-vic- tims (6%), victims (9%), borderline (22%), or unin- volved (56%) (Table 1). Boys were twice as likely as girls to be classified as bullies (10% vs 5%),  3 times as likely to be classified as bully-victims (10% vs 3%), and almost twice as likely to be classified as victims (12% vs 7%; Table 1).\nType of involvement also varied by race/ethnicity (Table 1). Black and other youth were most likely and Asian least likely to be classified as bullies (11% and 10% vs 3%, respecetively). Other and white were more likely and Latino least likely to be classified as victims (13% and 12% vs 7%, respectively). Black youth were most likely to be classified as bully- victims (10%).\nSelf-Reported Psychological Distress\nSignificant differences appeared on all psycholog- ical adjustment indicators, with bullies reporting the lowest and victims reporting the highest levels of depression, social anxiety, and loneliness (Fig 1). Bul- ly-victims generally fell in between, with elevated levels of depression and loneliness but average levels of social anxiety.\nPeer-Rated Adjustment\nBullies were regarded as the highest and victims the lowest in social status (Fig 2). However, class- mates avoided both bullies and victims and espe- cially bully-victims more than they avoided other classmates.\nTeacher-Rated School Engagement and Social Adjustment\nThe 5 groups also showed differences in teacher ratings of school engagement and social adjustment\n(Fig 3). Consistent with peer nominations (Pearson r   0.37; P   .001 between teacher ratings of popu- larity and peer nominations of social status), teacher ratings indicated that bullies were most popular and victims were least popular. Teachers also rated vic- tims as displaying more internalizing problems (eg, sadness or anxiety) than bullies or bully-victims (but not more than the uninvolved). Teachers ranked bul- ly-victims as manifesting by far the most and unin- volved students the least conduct problems. All 3 groups of students involved with bullying, especially bully-victims, were rated as more disengaged in school than their classmates.\nMultivariate Analyses\nMultivariate analyses of covariance predicting each of the measures of self-, peer-, and teacher-rated adjustment by controlling for gender and race/eth- nicity differences were conducted. The results were essentially identical to the bivariate analyses.\nSensitivity Analyses\nWe conducted 2 sets of sensitivity analyses by changing the 0.5 cutoff for the standard deviation above the mean cutoff to 0.75 and 1.00, respectively. Although these modifications necessarily identified smaller groups more intensely involved in bullying, the pattern of differences across the 5 groups was the same for all analyses with no evidence of the findings being dependent on the specific cutoff criterion.\nDISCUSSION\nAmong youth involved in bullying in a commu- nity sample of ethnically diverse middle school stu- dents, we found that bullies manifest the fewest number of adjustment problems. Specifically, bullies are psychologically stronger than classmates not in- volved in bullying, and they enjoy high social status among their classmates (although the classmates tend to avoid their company). Victims, on the other hand, suffer not only emotional distress but also social marginalization (ie, classmates avoid them, and they have low social status). Finally, those who both bully and get bullied (ie, bully-victims) are es- pecially troubled. They are by far the most socially ostracized by their peers, most likely to display con- duct problems, and least engaged in school, and they also report elevated levels of depression and loneli- ness.\nTABLE 1.

Group means on standardized scores of peer-reported social adjustment problems.\n Our findings about bullies are distinct from the findings in some studies that have reported that bullies tend to be depressed and have psychological distress.2\xe2\x80\x93 4 However, these studies have depended on self-reports of being a bully, and it is unlikely that bullies as a group provide accurate self-reports of how they treat others. Instead, we used the well- validated peer nomination method to collect reports from classmates about the roles students play. This approach provided identification of bullies (and vic- tims) based on a consensus of a large group of stu- dents who know and observe all students in a class.\nWhereas prior studies had the unexpected finding of a fairly uniform psychological and social picture of bullies and victims,2\xe2\x80\x934 we found that despite some common characteristics (eg, school disengagement problems), these groups are distinct, which has im- plications for identifying them and intervening. For example, although prior studies could be interpreted as indicating a need to focus on depression in ad- dressing the needs of bullies, this approach may be useful only for the subset most likely to self-identify, not for those who do not admit to bullying.\nAlthough the use of peer nominations to classify\n1234 BULLYING AMONG YOUNG ADOLESCENTS\nDownloaded from by guest on April 20, 2017\n Fig 3. Group means on standardized scores of teacher-rated social adjustment problems.\nyouth into bully, victim, and bully-victim groups is a strength of the study, there can be biases in the manner respondents identify classmates as bullies or victims. Who is reported as a bully or victim may be determined not only by individuals\xe2\x80\x99 behavior but also by the biases of the observer.22 For example, the behaviors of 2 classmates acting in the same way may be reported differently by other students de- pending on the implicit stereotype associated with the 2 students\xe2\x80\x99 social category (eg, race or gender). Future studies are needed to help us better under- stand the conditions under which racial and gender biases are most likely to emerge. How such biases may influence adolescent behavior, psychological well-being, and school functioning is another ques- tion for future research.\nThe superior mental health (lack of psychological stress) of bullies documented in the current study can in part be understood in light of the social pres- tige that they enjoy among their classmates. Devel- opmental research shows that in early adolescence, social status is one of the strongest predictors of positive self-views and psychological well-being.23,24 Hence, it is likely that teenaged bullies do not feel depressed, anxious, or lonely because they have high social status within their peer collective. It is never- theless important to keep in mind that, despite bul- lies\xe2\x80\x99 high social status, classmates would rather not spend time with them. Thus, it may be that the social prestige of bullies is motivated in part by fear.\nRegardless of the reasons behind the favorable social ranking of bullies, the high status imposes a challenge for addressing bullying problems. When bullies are considered the \xe2\x80\x9ccoolest,\xe2\x80\x9d bullying be- havior is encouraged. This finding underscores the im- portance of addressing bullying as a systemic problem that involves the whole peer collective. Comprehen- sive, school-wide antibullying programs25,26 aim to change peer dynamics that encourage and maintain bullying by raising the awareness of how bystanders\ncontribute to the problem of bullying.27 Perspective- taking exercises (including videotaped vignettes of typical incidents) depict the way in which bystanders encourage bullies. These same exercises may be use- ful for increasing empathy for victims such that stu- dents become more conscious of the plight of the victim.28\nThe current findings indicate that groups of teens who report elevated psychological distress are the same ones who others report as having trouble fit- ting in or being accepted by their peers. This finding underscores the importance of also understanding the social plight of victims: they are not only targeted by bullies but also ostracized by many of their class- mates. To address the adjustment difficulties of vic- tims, it may be that psychological services that focus solely on the emotional problems are inadequate; efforts to deal with the social issues are also needed. This means that clinicians working outside of the school, who might be most qualified to provide such individually focused psychological services, may have limited capacity to intervene. The lack of con- nections between clinicians, who see youth outside of school, and teachers and other school staff, who see youth in school, is a problem that complicates interventions. One of the challenges with bullying among school children therefore is to try to build and maintain links between clinicians and school staff.\nCompared with bullies and victims, the bully-vic- tim group seems to have the worst of both worlds and a unique risk profile. Their high levels of social avoidance, conduct problems, and school difficulties suggest that they are a particularly high-risk group.2,5 Indeed, previous research indicates that bully- victims are most vulnerable to both concurrent and subsequent psychiatric disorders.4 Victims who bully others also best fit the profiles of seriously violent offenders. For example, a recent in-depth case analysis of 37 intended and conducted school shoot- ings revealed that  2/3 of the alleged perpetrators\nDownloaded from by guest on April 20, 2017\nARTICLES 1235\nhad been bullied by their peers, and most of them also displayed signs of violent ideation (eg, self- destructive thoughts and interest in violent games and films).8\nAlthough our cross-sectional data do not show whether adjustment problems cause bullying or vic- timization, or vice versa, or whether some other characteristic such as underlying psychopathology causes both, other studies have suggested that there are long-term implications. Several longitudinal studies suggest that bullying is a risk factor for sub- sequent conduct problems including violent behav- ior28,29 and that victimization is predictive of not only current but also subsequent mental health prob- lems.10\nBullying does not affect just those directly in- volved, but it can affect all youth who witness bul- lying. In a recent national survey, the highest per- centage (68%) of 12- to 15-year-old children rated teasing and bullying as a \xe2\x80\x9cbig problem\xe2\x80\x9d for people their age.30 In light of such statistics, it is clear that problems associated with bullying and victimization are not problems affecting only a small proportion of youth. Moreover, based on the current findings, it seems that problems associated with bullying are likely to cut across race/ethnicity, socioeconomic sta- tus, and culture.\nAs recommended by the American Medical Asso- ciation,31 pediatricians, school psychologists, and other clinicians need additional information about bullies, victims, and their associated health prob- lems. Because young adolescents are reluctant to talk about bullying, health professionals might at times detect symptoms of bullying and victimization be- fore the youth\xe2\x80\x99s role in bullying becomes known. However, symptoms may be spotted more easily for some of the groups (ie, bully-victims) than for others. For example, we found that victims manifest quiet signs of psychological distress that may not be de- tected easily by teachers. Despite the relatively high self-reports of psychological distress, teachers did not rate victims as having significantly more inter- nalizing problems than students who are uninvolved in bullying. Hence, public-awareness campaigns that not only inform professionals and parents about bul- lying but also encourage youth to speak out about their problems are needed.\nTeachers play a key role in preventing and inter- vening with bullying at school, yet they receive little if any help or training in how to effectively deal with such problems. They lack information, and they are reluctant to intervene when they witness bullying. Although teachers have the benefit of understanding the social context of bullying, they do not necessarily know how to best use this knowledge to intervene. In school settings, bullying and victimization are often considered as personal problems of individual youth rather than problems requiring a collective response. Therefore, it is essential 1) to educate teachers about ways in which schools can alter social norms toward bullying, 2) to assist them to intervene effectively with incidents of bullying, and 3) to work together with clinicians to deal with the symptoms of bullying and victimization.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was supported by the National Science Foundation (BCS-9911525 to Dr Graham, principal investigator), the W.

Overall funding increased by about 30% in the last settlement. But 16 societies\xe2\x80\x94including the British Medical Association, the Royal Society and the Royal Geographical Society\xe2\x80\x94as well as the university establishment have made a joint appeal to the Government to reverse its plans, says The Times Higher Education Supplement (THES) (September 5). \xe2\x80\x98Scholars of the highest caliber are found across the sector and in all regions, in departments small and large,\xe2\x80\x99 Rita Gardner, director of the Royal Geographical Society, said. Michael Hyland, professor of health psychology at the University of Plymouth, said there was a question mark over the higher education establishment\xe2\x80\x99s assumption that teaching and research are inex- tricably linked. \xe2\x80\x98Research-active staff argue that they are more up-to-date. But this can be achieved through scholarship rather than active research . . . and the content of most undergraduate courses is at least a few years old,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. The THES\xe2\x80\x99s lead editorial pointed out that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s position rests on the fact that no clear evidence of a link between teaching and research has been produced.\xe2\x80\x9d\nDo lecturers need to research?

Although much of the formal research on bullying has taken place in the Scandinavian countries, Great Britain, and Japan, the problems associated with bullying have been noted and discussed wherever formal schooling environments exist.\nBullying is comprised of direct behaviors such as teasing, taunting, threatening, hitting, and stealing that are initiated by one or more students against a victim. In addition to direct attacks, bullying may also be more indirect by causing a student to be socially isolated through intentional exclusion. While boys typically engage in direct bullying methods, girls who bully are more apt to utilize these more subtle indirect strategies, such as spreading rumors and enforcing social isolation (Ahmad & Smith, 1994; Smith & Sharp, 1994). Whether the bullying is direct or indirect, the key component of bullying is that the physical or psychological intimidation occurs repeatedly over time to create an ongoing pattern of harassment and abuse (Batsche & Knoff, 1994; Olweus, 1993).\nEXTENT OF THE PROBLEM\nVarious reports and studies have established that approximately 15% of students are either bullied regularly or are initiators of bullying behavior (Olweus, 1993). Direct bullying seems to increase through the elementary years, peak in the middle school/junior high school years, and decline during the high school years. However, while direct physical assault seems to decrease with age, verbal abuse appears to remain constant. School size, racial composition, and school setting (rural, suburban, or urban) do not seem to be distinguishing factors in predicting the occurrence of bullying. Finally, boys engage in bullying behavior and are victims of bullies more frequently than girls (Batsche & Knoff, 1994; Nolin, Davies, & Chandler, 1995; Olweus, 1993; Whitney & Smith, 1993).\nCHARACTERISTICS OF BULLIES AND VICTIMS\nStudents who engage in bullying behaviors seem to have a need to feel powerful and in control. They appear to derive satisfaction from inflicting injury and suffering on others, seem to have little empathy for their victims, and often defend their actions by saying that their victims provoked them in some way. Studies indicate that bullies often come from homes where physical punishment is used, where the children are taught to strike back physically as a way to handle problems, and where parental involvement and warmth are frequently lacking. Students who regularly display bullying behaviors are generally defiant or oppositional toward adults, antisocial, and apt to break school rules. In contrast to prevailing myths, bullies appear to have little anxiety and to possess strong self-esteem. There is little evidence to support the contention that they victimize others because they feel bad about themselves (Batsche & Knoff, 1994; Olweus, 1993). Students who are victims of bullying are typically anxious, insecure, cautious, and suffer from low self-esteem, rarely defending themselves or retaliating when confronted by students who bully them. They may lack social skills and friends, and they are often\nPage 2 of 6 ED407154 1997-04-00 Bullying in Schools. ERIC Digest.\nERIC Resource Center www.eric.ed.gov\nsocially isolated. Victims tend to be close to their parents and may have parents who can be described as overprotective. The major defining physical characteristic of victims is that they tend to be physically weaker than their peers--other physical characteristics such as weight, dress, or wearing eyeglasses do not appear to be significant factors that can be correlated with victimization (Batsche & Knoff, 1994; Olweus, 1993).\nCONSEQUENCES OF BULLYING\nAs established by studies in Scandinavian countries, a strong correlation appears to exist between bullying other students during the school years and experiencing legal or criminal troubles as adults. In one study, 60% of those characterized as bullies in grades 6-9 had at least one criminal conviction by age 24 (Olweus, 1993). Chronic bullies seem to maintain their behaviors into adulthood, negatively influencing their ability to develop and maintain positive relationships (Oliver, Hoover, & Hazler, 1994). Victims often fear school and consider school to be an unsafe and unhappy place. As many as 7% of America\'s eighth-graders stay home at least once a month because of bullies. The act of being bullied tends to increase some students\' isolation because their peers do not want to lose status by associating with them or because they do not want to increase the risks of being bullied themselves. Being bullied leads to depression and low self-esteem, problems that can carry into adulthood (Olweus, 1993; Batsche & Knoff, 1994).\nPERCEPTIONS OF BULLYING\nOliver, Hoover, and Hazler (1994) surveyed students in the Midwest and found that a clear majority felt that victims were at least partially responsible for bringing the bullying on themselves. Students surveyed tended to agree that bullying toughened a weak person, and some felt that bullying "taught" victims appropriate behavior. Charach, Pepler, and Ziegler (1995) found that students considered victims to be "weak," "nerds," and "afraid to fight back." However, 43% of the students in this study said that they try to help the victim, 33% said that they should help but do not, and only 24% said that bullying was none of their business.\nParents are often unaware of the bullying problem and talk about it with their children only to a limited extent (Olweus, 1993). Student surveys reveal that a low percentage of students seem to believe that adults will help. Students feel that adult intervention is infrequent and ineffective, and that telling adults will only bring more harassment from bullies. Students report that teachers seldom or never talk to their classes about bullying (Charach, Pepler, & Ziegler, 1995). School personnel may view bullying as a harmless right of passage that is best ignored unless verbal and psychological intimidation crosses the line into physical assault or theft.\nINTERVENTION PROGRAMS\nED407154 1997-04-00 Bullying in Schools. ERIC Digest. Page 3 of 6\nwww.eric.ed.gov ERIC Custom Transformations Team\nBullying is a problem that occurs in the social environment as a whole. The bullies\' aggression occurs in social contexts in which teachers and parents are generally unaware of the extent of the problem and other children are either reluctant to get involved or simply do not know how to help (Charach, Pepler, & Ziegler, 1995). Given this situation, effective interventions must involve the entire school community rather than focus on the perpetrators and victims alone. Smith and Sharp (1994) emphasize the need to develop whole-school bullying policies, implement curricular measures, improve the schoolground environment, and empower students through conflict resolution, peer counseling, and assertiveness training. Olweus (1993) details an approach that involves interventions at the school, class, and individual levels. It includes the following components:\n* An initial questionnaire can be distributed to students and adults. The questionnaire helps both adults and students become aware of the extent of the problem, helps to justify intervention efforts, and serves as a benchmark to measure the impact of improvements in school climate once other intervention components are in place.\n* A parental awareness campaign can be conducted during parent-teacher conference days, through parent newsletters, and at PTA meetings. The goal is to increase parental awareness of the problem, point out the importance of parental involvement for program success, and encourage parental support of program goals. Questionnaire results are publicized.\n* Teachers can work with students at the class level to develop class rules against bullying. Many programs engage students in a series of formal role-playing exercises and related assignments that can teach those students directly involved in bullying alternative methods of interaction. These programs can also show other students how they can assist victims and how everyone can work together to create a school climate where bullying is not tolerated (Sjostrom & Stein, 1996).\n* Other components of anti-bullying programs include individualized interventions with the bullies and victims, the implementation of cooperative learning activities to reduce social isolation, and increasing adult supervision at key times (e.g., recess or lunch). Schools that have implemented Olweus\'s program have reported a 50% reduction in bullying.\nCONCLUSION\nBullying is a serious problem that can dramatically affect the ability of students to progress academically and socially. A comprehensive intervention plan that involves all students, parents, and school staff is required to ensure that all students can learn in a safe and fear-free environment.\nA RESOURCE LIST ON THIS TOPIC IS ALSO AVAILABLE.\nPage 4 of 6 ED407154 1997-04-00 Bullying in Schools.

Involvement of children, teachers and parents in bullying behavior\nM. Fekkes1,4, F. I. M. Pijpers2 and S. P. Verloove-Vanhorick1,3\n  Abstract\nBullying victimization is associated with several health issues. Prevention of bullying is therefore an important goal for health and education professionals. In the present study, 2766 children from 32 Dutch elementary schools participated by completing a questionnaire on bullying be- havior, and the involvement of teachers, parents and classmates in bullying incidents. The results of this study show that bullying is still prevalent in Dutch schools. More than 16% of the children aged 9\xe2\x80\x9311 years reported being bullied on a regular basis and 5.5% reported regular active bullying during the current school term. Almost half of the bullied children did not tell their teacher that they were being bullied. When teachers knew about the bullying, they often tried to stop it, but in many cases the bullying stayed the same or even got worse. With regard to active bullying, neither the majority of the teachers nor parents talked to the bullies about their behavior. Our results stress the importance of regular communication between children, parents, teachers and health care professionals with regard to bullying incidents. In addition, teachers need to learn effective ways to deal with\n1TNO (Netherlands Organization of Applied Scientific Research) Prevention and Health, PO Box 2215, 2301 CE Leiden, 2GG & GD Amsterdam, PO Box 2200, 1000 CE Amsterdam and 3LUMC (Leiden University Medical Center) Department of Pediatrics and Child Health,\nPO Box 9600, 2300 RC Leiden, The Netherlands 4Correspondence to: M.

Schools need to adopt a whole-school approach with their anti-bullying interventions.\nIntroduction\nBullying is a specific form of aggressive behavior and can be described as a situation when a student: \xe2\x80\x98is exposed repeatedly and over time, to negative actions on the part of one or more students\xe2\x80\x99 (Olweus, 1993a). These negative actions take place when an imbalance of power exists between the vic- tim and the aggressor. The bullying behavior can be \xe2\x80\x98physical\xe2\x80\x99 (e.g. hitting, pushing, kicking), \xe2\x80\x98verbal\xe2\x80\x99 (e.g. calling names, provoking, making threats, spreading slander), or can include other behavior such as making faces or social exclusion.\nStudies in several countries indicate a prevalence of 8\xe2\x80\x9346% for regularly bullied children and 5\xe2\x80\x9330% for regular active bullies (Olweus, 1991; Mooij, 1992; Boulton and Underwood, 1992; Whitney and Smith, 1993; Genta et al., 1996; Borg, 1999; Junger-Tas and van Kesteren, 1999; Nansel et al., 2001; Wolke et al., 2001). Regular bullying is hereby usually defined as recurrent behavior with a frequency of either \xe2\x80\x98several times a month\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x98sometimes\xe2\x80\x99 or on a \xe2\x80\x98weekly\xe2\x80\x99 basis. Boys are generally more often active bullies than girls, but whereas boys bully in a more direct way (e.g. hit- ting, kicking), girls bully in a more indirect way (e.g. excluding others, starting rumors) which is some- times referred to as relational bullying (Crick and Grotpeter,1995,1996;Wolkeetal.,2000).Forvictim- ization there are no large gender differences\xe2\x80\x94boys are bullied as often as girls.\n     Health Education Research Vol.20 no.1, O\xcc\x81 Oxford University Press 2005; All rights reserved doi:10.1093/her/cyg100\nM. Fekkes et al.\n Bullying does not only occur between children who bully and those who are bullied, but is consid- ered a group phenomenon in which other children participate. Bystanders can assist the bully, or try to help the victim, or they can withdraw and try not to get involved (Atlas and Pepler, 1998). Bully- ing incidents usually involve several bystanders (O\xe2\x80\x99Connel et al., 1999) and in most cases these bystanders do not try to stop the bullying which may be interpreted by the bully as a reinforcement to continue the bullying. However, it has also been shown that when bystanders intervene and try to stop the bullying, they are effective in a majority of the cases (Hawkins et al., 2001). It is therefore important to utilize this \xe2\x80\x98peer group power\xe2\x80\x99 and teach children strategies to effectively intervene, so bullies will be isolated from their social support (O\xe2\x80\x99Connel et al., 1999; Salmivalli, 1999; Sutton and Smith, 1999).\nBeing a victim or an active bully is associated with an increased risk of mental and physical health problems. Children who are bullied suffer more of- ten from health complaints such as sleeping problems, headache, stomach ache, bedwetting and depres- sion (Williams et al., 1996; Salmon et al., 1998; Forero et al., 1999), and have more often suicidal thoughts (Kaltiala-Heino et al., 1999; Cleary, 2000). Active bullying is found to be associated with higher levels of depression, and emotional and behavioral disorders (Rigby, 1998; Kumpulainen et al., 1999; van der Wal et al., 2003).\nEspecially with regard to victimization, it is debated whether these health complaints precede the bullying victimization or whether bullying vic- timization precedes the onset of these health prob- lems. The stress caused by bullying could lead to the higher number of health complaints (Boivin et al., 1995), but children with health problems such as depression or anxiety may also be more vulner- able to being bullied by other children (Schwartz et al., 1993; Hodges et al., 1997). Few studies have investigated this relationship, but there is some sup- port for both hypotheses. In a longitudinal study, Bond et al. (Bond et al., 2001) reported that bullying\xe2\x80\x94 especially for adolescent girls\xe2\x80\x94precedes health complaints like depression and anxiety. This suggests that the stress caused by bullying has\na negative influence on children\xe2\x80\x99s health. Other studies found support for an opposed relationship whereby internalized behavioral problems precede being bullied and increase the chances of being bul- lied over time (Hodges and Perry, 1999; Schwartz et al., 1999).\nIn addition to higher levels of health complaints, studies indicate that victims and bullies have char- acteristics that distinguish them from children who are not regularly involved in bullying behavior. Bullies are found to be more involved in aggressive, delinquent and violent behavior (Junger-Tas and van Kesteren, 1999; Baldry and Farrington, 2000). Victims usually have lower self-esteem than non- victims, are less assertive, tend to be more anxious, are more withdrawn, are physically smaller and weaker, and tend to have lower grades (Olweus, 1993a,b; Schwartz et al., 1993; Baldry, 1999). How- ever, like the association of bullying and health complaints, some of these characteristics can either precede or result from being bullied (Farrington, 1993).\nBecause bullying has a negative influence on children\xe2\x80\x99s mental and physical health, it is impor- tant that health care workers and teachers have a good understanding of bullying behavior and take measures to prevent or stop such behavior. Anti- bullying interventions are promoted via the Health Promoting Schools Framework (WHO, 1992) cur- rently of particular interest in Europe via the European Network for Health Promoting Schools (European Network for Health Promoting Schools, 2002). Components of this framework promote the involvement of the whole-school community, including\xe2\x80\x94among others\xe2\x80\x94pupils, teachers and parents in the efforts to combat bullying.\nThe data presented in this article aim to give more insight in the involvement of these groups in bullying behavior by investigating the following questions:\n(1) To what extent are children involved in general and specific bullying behavior?\n(2) According to the children, what is the in- volvement of others (i.e. teachers, parents, and classmates) with the bullying behavior?\n 82\n(3) How effective are the attempts of others (i.e. teachers, parents and classmates) to stop the bullying?\nMethods\nParticipants\nThe 2766 participants in this study were children from 32 Dutch elementary schools that participated in a longitudinal experimental study on the effec- tiveness of an anti-bullying policy at schools. The data presented here are baseline measurements made before any specific anti-bullying measures (as part of the study) had been implemented in the schools.\nIn November 1999, children from the upper three grades (9\xe2\x80\x9311 years old) completed a written ques- tionnaire in the classroom under exam-like condi- tions. In each classroom a research assistant was available to answer questions. The design of the study was approved by the local Medical Ethical Committee. All parental advisory boards of the participating schools were informed about the study and gave written informed consent for participation.\nQuestionnaire\nThe questionnaire contained items on the frequency of bullying behavior, the specific types of bullying behavior, where the bullying took place, who in- tervened to stop the bullying and if those interven- tions were successful. Several other health and demographic items were also included in the questionnaire.\nThe questions on general bullying behavior, where it took place and questions on intervening, were based on the Dutch version of the Olweus Bully/Victim Questionnaire (Liebrand et al., 1991; Mooij, 1992; Olweus, 1994). This is a well- documented questionnaire that is used in many studies on bullying (Olweus, 1991; Whitney and Smith, 1993; Genta et al., 1996; Baldry and Farrington, 1999). The questions on specific bully- ing are based on the Dutch version of a questionnaire used in a cross-national study on bullying (Junger- Tas and van Kesteren, 1999; Smith et al., 1999),\nwhich was based on a list of specific bullying behaviors developed by Whitney and Smith (Whitney and Smith, 1993).\nBeing bullied was assessed with the question \xe2\x80\x98How often did other children bully you during this school term?\xe2\x80\x99. Children could answer with the following options: \xe2\x80\x98I am not bullied\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x981 or 2 times\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x98a few times a month\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x98every week\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x982 or 3 times a week\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98almost every day\xe2\x80\x99.\nActive bullying was assessed with the question \xe2\x80\x98How often did you participate in bullying other children at school during this school term?\xe2\x80\x99. Op- tions for the answer ranged from \xe2\x80\x98I did not bully any children\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x981 or 2 times\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x98a few times a month\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x98every week\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x982 or 3 times a week\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98almost every day\xe2\x80\x99.\nOptions for those two items on being bullied and active bullying were slightly modified from the original questionnaire, whereby the original cate- gory \xe2\x80\x98sometimes\xe2\x80\x99 was changed into \xe2\x80\x98a few times a month\xe2\x80\x99. Also the last category \xe2\x80\x98almost every day\xe2\x80\x99 was added. These adjustments were made to create a more consistent range of frequency options.\nA student was considered a victim if he or she reported being bullied \xe2\x80\x98a few times a month\xe2\x80\x99 or more frequently. Likewise a student was considered a bully if he or she reported active bullying \xe2\x80\x98a few times a month\xe2\x80\x99 or more frequently.\nStatistical analysis\nAll analyses were performed with SPSS/PC. De- scriptive univariate statistics were used to analyze the prevalence of bullying behavior. Two sided t- tests and v2 analysis were used to analyze statistical differences between groups. The level for a statisti- cal significant difference was P < 0.05.\nResults\nGeneral characteristics of the sample\nOf the 2853 students, questionnaires were com- pleted by 2766 (response 97%). The main reason for non-response was absence of the child on the day of measurement. There was no follow up at another date for non-respondents.\nBullying: involvement of children, teachers and parents\n      83\nM. Fekkes et al.\n Mean age of the children was 10.1 (SD 1.1) years. The sample included 1370 boys (49.5%), 1384 girls (50.0 %) and 12 students (0.4%) for whom the gender was not stated. A total of 14.5% of the sample was of non-Dutch origin (i.e. both parents born outside The Netherlands).\nFrequency of bullying\nTable I shows the distribution of bully victimization and active bullying behavior amongst all children and amongst boys and girls separately. The results show that a substantial number (16.2%) of the children were bullied regularly (several times a month or more often), and more than 7% reported being bullied several times a week. There was no significant difference in being bullied between boys and girls (v2 = 0.38, P = 0.85). Children from a lower school grade were bullied more often than children from a higher grade (v2 = 56.93, P < 0.001).\nThe number of children who reported to actively bully others was less than those who reported being a victim of bullying (Table I). In total, 5.5% of the children bullied other children on a regular basis (i.e. several times a month or more often). Another 31.9% indicated that they had bullied another student at least once during the current term. There was a large gender difference; boys bullied much more frequently than girls (v2 = 29.21, P < 0.001). There was no difference in active bullying behavior between the different school grades (v2 = 0.12, P = 0.98).\nTable I. Reported frequency of bullying during current school term Being bullied [% (n)]\nType of bullying behavior\nTable II shows the types of bullying the children had experienced during the last four weeks. A substantial number of children experienced name- calling (30.9%), the spreading of rumors (24.8%), being ignored or not allowed to participate (17.2%), or being kicked, hit or pushed (14.7%). Girls were more likely to experience the spreading of rumors, being ignored or not being allowed to participate, whereas boys were more likely to experience physical forms of bullying.\nThose children who had indicated on the general question on bullying that they were bullied almost on a daily basis did experience a higher proportion of specific bullying behavior during the last four weeks, i.e. name-calling (90.3%), the spreading of rumors (89.1%), being ignored or not allowed to participate (60.8%), made fun of (74.3%), being kicked, hit or pushed (63.1%), or having things taken away or hidden (37.3%).\nTable III shows the different forms of active bullying. Saying bad things or name-calling (27.1%) was the most frequently reported form of active bullying behavior. Other forms of active bullying behavior reported by a substantial number of children were: the spreading of rumors (17.5%), making fun of others, while they don\xe2\x80\x99t like that (18.7%), ignoring or not allowing to participate (14.7%), or kicking, hitting and pushing (14.7%).

Fekkes et al.\n The children who had indicated on the question on general bullying that they bullied almost daily did report substantially higher numbers of specific bullying behavior, i.e. name-calling (66.7%), the spreading of rumors (52.9%), making fun of others, while they don\xe2\x80\x99t like that (52.9%), ignoring or not allowing to participate (41.2%), or kicking, hitting and pushing (58.8%), or taking things away or hiding them (47.1%).\nWho are the bullies?\nThe children were asked what school grade children who bullied others were from. Table IV shows that more than 60% of the victims were bullied by children from their own grade in the same group. About 10% were bullied by children from a higher grade and about 4% were bullied by children from a lower grade.\nChildren also reported whether they were bullied by boys, girls or both. Table V shows that almost 70% of the boys were bullied by other boys. About 44% of the girls were bullied by one or several boys and almost 23% of the girls were bullied by other girls. Boys were relatively less often bullied by girls.\nLocation of the bullying\nTable VI shows that most children were bullied either in the playground or in the classroom. A number of children were bullied in the hallway and in the gym. The category \xe2\x80\x98Somewhere else\xe2\x80\x99 includes places such as by the bicycle racks or near the home.\nTelling parents or teachers\nChildren who reported being bullied were asked if they spoke about this with the teacher or with their\nparents. Only 53% of the regularly bullied children told their teacher that bullying that took place, and 67% told their parents that they were bullied. Children who were bullied more frequently told their parents or teacher more often about the bullying than children who were bullied less reg- ularly (Table VII). Of all the children who were regularly bullied, 75% told at least one adult (their teacher or their parents, or both) about the bullying.\nThe children who were bullied were asked if one of their teachers, their parents, or their classmates tried to stop the bullying. Table VIII shows that a substantial number of both teachers and parents were unaware that the child was being bullied; for classmates this figure was lower. Of those teachers, parents and classmates who were aware of the bullying, the majority made an effort to stop the bullying. According to the children, when aware of the bullying, teachers tried to stop the bullying significantly more often than their parents (88 versus 60%; t = 6.17, P < 0.001) or their classmates (88 versus 54%; t = 8.32, P < 0.001). In attempts to stop the bullying, teachers were successful in 49% of the cases, parents in 46%, and classmates in 41%; according to the children being bullied.\nChildren who bullied other children were also asked if their teacher or parents talked to them about their bullying behavior. In general, 52.1% of the teachers and 33.3% of the parents talked to the regular bullies about their behavior. Table IX shows the percentage of teachers who spoke to the children about their behavior. Although teachers spoke somewhat more often to children who bullied most frequently (i.e. several times per week), many of those frequent bullies indicated that neither their\n Table IV.

More than 16% of the children aged 9\xe2\x80\x9311 years participating in this study reported being bullied on a regular basis during the current school term, i.e. a few times a month or more often. More than 10% of the children in- dicated being bullied at least once a week or more frequently. With regard to active bullying, almost 6% (an average of one child in every classroom) reported to bully several times a month to almost daily. Thirty-seven percent of children reported having bullied another student at least once during the last term.\nOur data on self-reported general bullying be- havior are supported by other studies in different countries and some of these studies found even higher levels of bullying behavior among the same age group. Olweus (Olweus, 1991) studied a large sample in Norway and found that 11% of the children in elementary school were bullied on a regular basis and 7% regularly bullied other children. In the UK, Whitney and Smith (Whitney and Smith, 1993) found that 27% reported being\n    87\nM. Fekkes et al.\n Table IX. Frequency of parents and teachers that spoke to the regular bullies about their behavior (n = 146)\nSmith, 1993; Rivers and Smith, 1994). This finding suggests that teachers should create an environment in which children are encouraged to talk more about their bullying experiences.\nOne of the components of the successful anti- bullying program developed by Olweus (Olweus, 1993a) is the development of a set of class rules aimed specifically at bullying. Rules can be dis- cussed during circle time and be posted in a visible place. Discussion of these rules can help build an anti-bullying ethos and encourage children to talk about their own bullying experiences.\nEncouraging other children to intervene when they notice bullying behavior can also be an important strategy to combat bullying. The inter- vening of bystanders to help the victim is known to be effective (Hawkins et al., 2001), but it is also known that the majority of bystanders do not inter- vene (O\xe2\x80\x99Connel et al., 1999). Motivating children to intervene and stand up for the victim could isolate bullies from their audience and social sup- port, and help to stop bullying behavior (O\xe2\x80\x99Connel et al., 1999; Salmivalli, 1999; Sutton and Smith, 1999). Exercises using role-play can be useful in helping children to rehearse different appropriate strategies to intervene and stop bullying behavior (Cowie and Sharp, 1995).\nAnother successful strategy is the Support Group Approach, whereby a support group, including those involved in the bullying and bystanders, is created for the victim and assigned the responsibil- ity for solving the bullying problem (Young, 1998).\nOur finding that children spoke more often to their parents than to their teachers about being bul- lied, something also noted by Whitney and Smith (Whitney and Smith, 1993), stresses the importance of regular communication between parents and teachers on the subject of bullying. Schools can inform parents via newsletters on the school policy on bullying and explicitly ask parents to report to the teacher if their child is being bullied. A school can also organize an educational session on the subject of bullying, and inform parents about their anti-bullying rules and policy. In addition, teachers should address the subject of bullying during their regular talks with the parents.\n  The teacher spoke to me about it (% yes)a My parents spoke to me about it (% yes)b\nChildren who bullied others several times per month [% (n)]\n50.0 (53)\n33.3 (35)\nChildren who bullied others several times per week [% (n)]\n57.5 (23)\n33.3 (12)\n bullied regularly and 12% reported regular active bullying. Genta et al. (Genta et al., 1996) found high numbers in Italy, with up to 46% being bullied and 23% actively bullying on a regular basis. More recent numbers on victimization vary from 24% in England, 17% in the US to 8% in Germany (Nansel et al., 2001; Wolke et al., 2001).\nThe frequency of being bullied among girls and boys was similar; however, the majority of boys were mostly bullied by other boys, while a sub- stantial number of girls were bullied by other girls. Some differences existed in types of bullying. Boys were more often kicked, pushed or hit, whereas girls were more often ignored, excluded or had rumors spread about them. Several other studies have also found this gender difference, whereby boys experience more direct bullying, while girls experience more indirect bullying (Whitney and Smith, 1993; Borg, 1999; Junger-Tas and van Kesteren, 1999).\nAs expected, most bullying took place in the playground and in the classroom, which are the two places where the children mostly interact with each other. This is in line with other reports (Whitney and Smith, 1993; Borg, 1999). The high prevalence of bullying in the playground suggests that more effective supervision is needed. Olweus (Olweus, 1993a) found that the level of bullying was lower in schools where there were relatively more teachers present (a higher \xe2\x80\x98teacher density\xe2\x80\x99) during recess and lunch breaks.\nAlmost half of the bullied children did not tell their teacher that they were being bullied, some- thing also noted in other studies (Whitney and\n 88\nBullying: involvement of children, teachers and parents\n We found that when teachers knew about the bullying, they often tried to stop it; however, in many cases the bullying stayed the same or even got worse. This could indicate that teachers should learn skills to more effectively intervene in bullying incidents. Organizations in several countries, e.g. Kidscape in the UK, and educational training cen- ters in The Netherlands such as APS and KPC, provide training to teach a variety of anti-bullying strategies (Ross, 1993; van der Meer, 1996; Elliott, 2002; Elliott and Kilpatrick, 2002).\nWith regard to active bullying, many of the teachers and parents did not talk to the bullies about their behavior. This could be because they did not know about the incidents or did not know what to do. Use of a survey can help reveal the level of bullying behavior. The Olweus anti-bullying pro- gram has such a questionnaire (Olweus, 1993a) and in The Netherlands teachers can use the \xe2\x80\x98Bullying Test\xe2\x80\x99 (Limper, 2000). It is important that teachers involve the parents of active bullies when solving a bullying problem, since bullies should also learn in their home environment that their behavior is condemned. A teacher could arrange a meeting with the victim, bully and both their parents to discuss the bullying, and create a plan to solve the issue (Olweus, 1993a).\nIt is important to include anti-bullying strategies\xe2\x80\x94such as those mentioned above\xe2\x80\x94as part of a whole-school anti-bullying policy. A whole- school approach is aimed at actively involving the whole-school community, i.e. pupils, school staff and parents, in the efforts to tackle the bullying (Sharp and Thompson, 1994). Several programs that embrace this whole-school approach are avail- able, such as the Olweus anti-bullying program (Olweus, 1993a) or the UK anti-bullying package \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t Suffer in Silence\xe2\x80\x99 (DfES, 2002). These programs include many of the strategies mentioned above.\nAnti-bullying interventions are also part of the Health Promoting Schools Framework. The Health Promoting Schools initiative was launched by the WHO and is a worldwide approach where schools provide education and support to enhance the emotional, social, and physical well-being of all\nmembers of their school community (WHO, 1992). Especially in Europe\xe2\x80\x94via the European Network for Health Promoting Schools\xe2\x80\x94and in Australia, this has stimulated the development and implemen- tation of many school health programs, including several anti-bullying interventions (European Net- work for Health Promoting Schools, 2002; Cross, 2003).\nOur current project is linked to the national action plan on school health in The Netherlands (Buijs et al., 2002). This article presents the baseline measure of the first phase of this project. In this first phase, the effects of an anti-bullying policy in elementary schools will be studied. In a following phase Regional Health Centers will assist schools in several regions to implement a whole-school anti-bullying policy and this large- scale implementation process will be evaluated.\nIn The Netherlands, Regional Health Centers have been involved in health promotion in schools for many years (Buijs et al., 2002). Part of the national action plan on school health is to have those centers systematically describe the health status of the pupils, including bullying, for schools. In addition to assisting schools with implementing an anti-bullying policy, such structural communi- cation on bullying behavior between schools and the Regional Health Centers could help to keep teachers informed about the prevalence of bullying behavior and would strengthen the whole-school approach.\nConclusion\nThe results of our study show that bullying is still prevalent in Dutch elementary schools and that teachers do not always effectively deal with many of the bullying incidents. Schools need to adopt a whole-school approach to bullying prevention, such as promoted in the Health Promoting Schools framework. All parties, i.e. school staff, pupils and parents, as well as organizations connected to the school community, need to be involved in cooper- ative efforts to prevent and diminish bullying behavior in schools. Children should be actively\n   89\nM. Fekkes et al.\n involved in the anti-bullying strategies; they should be taught rules that bullying is not accepted, and they should be motivated to intervene, stop and report bullying incidents.\nParents need to be informed on the school\xe2\x80\x99s anti- bullying policy and be involved when bullying incidents occur. Parents should also be invited to report when their child is being bullied.\nTeachers should learn effective ways to handle and solve bullying incidents, and schools should aim to improve their interventions for bullying incidents by cooperation with relevant organiza- tions, such as the Regional Health Centers in The Netherlands. Detection of bullying incidents would be improved by regular and structural communica- tion on the subject of bullying between pupils, teachers, parents and school health care workers.\nAcknowledgements\nThis study was financially supported by Zorg Onderzoek Nederland (grant 22000061).\nReferences\nAtlas, R.S. and Pepler, D.J.

aS'onflict Resolution and Bully Prevention: Skills for School Success\nROBERTA A. HEYDENBERK WARREN R. HEYDENBERK VERA TZENOVA\n\n\nIn a two-year study, 673 elementary students participated in a bully prevention program that included seven training sessions introducing affective vocabulary, social and emotional literacy, and conflict resolu- tion skills. Treatment groups showed statistically significant gains on the conflict resolution subscale of the standardized instrument employed. No gains were found in the comparison groups. A decrease in bullying and an increased sense of safety were indicated from student and staff questionnaire responses.\nAsurvey of more than fifteen hundred students for the World Health Organization found that approximately 20 percent of students reported having been bullied (identified themselves as victims), and 20 percent of students identified themselves as bullies. Despite positive changes in several measures of school safety, one in ten students reported having been threatened or injured on school property in the preceding twelve months, and more than 5 percent reported missing school due to safety concerns and threats from fellow students (Brener, Lowry, and Barrios, 2003). Victims are at increased risk for depression and other mental health problems while bullies are six times as likely as their less hostile counterparts to have criminal records as young adults (Hoover and Oliver, 1996).\nCONFLICT RESOLUTION QUARTERLY, vol. 24, no. 1, Fall 2006 \xc2\xa9 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. 55 and the Association for Conflict Resolution \xe2\x80\xa2 DOI: 10.1002/crq.157\n \n                                        56 HEYDENBERK, HEYDENBERK, TZENOVA\nHowever, bullies and victims are not the only students who suffer the long- and short-term consequences of bullying. Students in school environments rife with bullying often fear they will be the next target of such behavior, reducing their sense of safety (Cooper and Snell, 2003). A decreased sense of safety in school has significant effects. A neurological response to fear, often termed hijacking, may prevent many students from learning in a threatening school environment. Active fear and stress reduce activity in the cerebral cortex\xe2\x80\x94the area of the brain needed to complete complex cognitive tasks. When students do not feel safe, \xe2\x80\x9cit is the thinking brain in the frontal cortex [which] is overrun by the more automatic responses of the subcortical limbic system. To avert this occurrence, social and emotional skills must be strengthened through practice in a wide range of contexts\xe2\x80\x9d (Elias and others, 1997, p. 56).\nInspired by the prevalence and consequences of bullying, numerous studies have been conducted on the efficacy of varied school safety programs, and the findings of these studies are encouraging. Conflict res- olution program evaluations show that such programs not only reduce aggression and violence in communities and their schools but also pro- vide \xe2\x80\x9clife long decision making skills\xe2\x80\x9d (U.S. Department of Justice, 1997, p. 55) and enhance the self-esteem of students. A study conducted by the Center for Law-Related Education (Bodine, 1996) found that most conflict resolution programs reduce the time teachers spend on conflicts, improve school climate, and enhance problem-solving skills and self-control among students. Conflict resolution training effects include increases in peaceful problem solving and reductions of more than 50 percent in violence in even the most violent gangs (Sherman, 1997). Significant reductions in destructive behavior are often the case in school settings as well (Johnson and Johnson, 1996; Zins, Weissberg, Wang, and Walberg, 2004; Heydenberk and Heydenberk, 2005).\nResearch has shown that the success of any program depends on skill development: \xe2\x80\x9cWithout skills students and teachers can envision what a caring community can look like, but are unable to get there. As important as it is to build the vision and align people around the need to achieve the vision, it is also important to give them tools to create that envisioned real- ity\xe2\x80\x9d (Jones and Compton, 2003, p. 295). This study examines the efficacy and transfer rate of specific conflict resolution and social problem-solving skills as well as bullying behaviors and school safety within a diverse sample of third, fourth, and fifth grade students.\nCONFLICT RESOLUTION QUARTERLY \xe2\x80\xa2 DOI: 10.1002/crq\n                                        Conflict Resolution and Bully Prevention 57 Review of Related Research\nAspy and her colleagues (2004) interviewed more than one thousand middle and high school students and parents. Using logistic regression analyses, the researchers examined the relationship between youth assets and high-risk behaviors. The sense of feeling safe at school and the ability to \xe2\x80\x9cresolve conflicts without fighting [and] speak calmly even when angry\xe2\x80\x9d (p. 273) were significantly associated with avoiding fighting and violence. This corroborated our findings in this population: increased sense of safety, increased use of conflict resolution skills, and decreased fighting.\nPoor social skills and poor affect regulation often predict peer rejec- tion, weak attachments, and the alienation that leads to further social isolation and mental health risks. When a school develops a conflict reso- lution program, it helps students succeed in three ways. First, \xe2\x80\x9cresolving conflicts in principled ways promotes and preserves relationships, thereby facilitating the bonding that is essential\xe2\x80\x9d (Crawford and Bodine, 1996, p. 73). Second, the conflict resolution education helps students control their behavior and make smarter choices. Finally, setting up a conflict res- olution program empowers students by encouraging them to solve their own problems rather than having them controlled by teachers and staff. Without a conflict resolution program, conflicts can predict \xe2\x80\x9cdetachment from school and lower grades\xe2\x80\x9d (Johnson and Johnson, 1996, p. 482). An evaluation of conflict resolution programs in fifty Ohio high schools found that positive changes in school climate reduced fighting, and 90 percent of teachers felt their schools were safer as a result of the conflict resolution program. Eighty-six percent of the Ohio teachers in the study felt that students were more likely to take responsibility for resolving their conflicts (Batton, 2002).\nSocial interaction and a sense of self-efficacy appear to be so central to a child\xe2\x80\x99s well-being that researchers have argued that these motivation systems are \xe2\x80\x9cinherent in our species\xe2\x80\x9d (Masten and Coatsworth, 1998, p. 208). Children\xe2\x80\x99s innate motivation in the area of self-efficacy is \xe2\x80\x9creadily observable in the inclination of young children to actively engage with the environment and to experience pleasure from effective interactions\xe2\x80\x9d (Masten and Coatsworth, 1998, p. 208). Research focused on our youngest children reveals that babies exhibit motivation to achieve mastery of social self-efficacy with caregivers and show distress when they cannot interact successfully (Masten and Coatsworth, 1998).\nCONFLICT RESOLUTION QUARTERLY \xe2\x80\xa2 DOI: 10.1002/crq\n                                        58 HEYDENBERK, HEYDENBERK, TZENOVA\nProblem-solving skills and a sense of self-efficacy affect students\xe2\x80\x99 choices of activities, goals, and behaviors and \xe2\x80\x9cpredict such diverse out- comes as academic achievement, social skills, pain tolerance, athletic per- formances [and] coping with feared events\xe2\x80\x9d (Schunk, 1991, p. 207). People with a low sense of self-efficacy may avoid a task that would bene- fit themselves or others for fear of failure. Self-efficacy \xe2\x80\x9cis not the only influence on behavior\xe2\x80\x9d (Schunk, 1991, p. 209), nor is it necessarily the most important. Students must also have the requisite skills to maintain a sense of self-efficacy.\nIn social and academic settings, much of a student\xe2\x80\x99s success will be deter- mined by skills: a \xe2\x80\x9chigh [sense of ] self-efficacy will not produce competent performances when requisite skills are lacking\xe2\x80\x9d (Schunk, 1991, p. 209). In short, when students have skills and the opportunities to resolve their problems successfully and handle problems effectively, they develop the self- efficacy and motivation dispositions that may enable them to continue to function well. In some instances, students who consider themselves good problem solvers not only accept but may actually welcome an opportunity to mediate a conflict successfully (Heydenberk and Heydenberk, 2000; Heydenberk, Heydenberk, Williams, and Pelly, forthcoming).\nSocial competence, including self-regulation and problem-solving style, is a \xe2\x80\x9cpowerful predictor of academic achievement\xe2\x80\x9d (Wentzel, 1991b, p. 1066). In fact, these \xe2\x80\x9cinterpersonal forms of competence are often more powerful predictors of achievement than intellectual ability\xe2\x80\x9d (Wentzel, 1991b, p. 1066). Wentzel\xe2\x80\x99s study of the relationship between social com- petence and academic achievement found that \xe2\x80\x9csocially responsible behavior mediates almost entirely the relationship between students\xe2\x80\x99 grades\xe2\x80\x9d (p. 1066) and other aspects of social competence, including sociometric status. Self-regulated behavior appears to be determined by three components: levels of interpersonal trust, interpersonal problem solving, and a sense of social responsibility (Wentzel, 1991b, p. 1067). All three of these subcomponents of self-regulation have been linked \xe2\x80\x9cempir- ically to objective indices of social competence as well as to intellectual accomplishments\xe2\x80\x9d (Wentzel, 1991b, p. 1067). It appears that \xe2\x80\x9cthe ability to control negative emotional reactions to failure may contribute to both socially and academically competent outcomes\xe2\x80\x9d (Wentzel, 1991b, p. 1068).\nThere is abundant evidence that problem-solving skill development, self-efficacy, and social responsibility are essential to students\xe2\x80\x99 academic and social success. Interviews and evaluation research on school programs\nCONFLICT RESOLUTION QUARTERLY \xe2\x80\xa2 DOI: 10.1002/crq\n                                        Conflict Resolution and Bully Prevention 59\nsuggest that skill development is an essential component for program success. Pro-social values, good intentions, and vision are not enough if students do not have the requisite skills (Jones and Compton, 2003). However, there is much less research on the specific social skills and conflict resolution skills that increase problem-solving ability and self-regulation for various age groups. For this reason, this study analyzed specific skills used to resolve conflict and avoid bullying behaviors as well as perceived sense of safety and peer relations.\nSample and Design of the Study\nThe study was conducted in two suburban schools near Philadelphia. Both schools were within the same school district. The treatment groups were third and fourth grade students, and the comparison groups were third and fifth grade students from the same schools who did not participate in the conflict resolution program.\nIn year one, a pilot study of 437 students was conducted. A posttest- only student evaluation with high content validity was used to rate pro- gram effects and to evaluate program strategies. A teacher questionnaire was also employed during year one to rate program strategies, changes in classroom climate, sense of school safety, and changes in student bullying behavior. In year two, three instruments were used to assess program effects. The year-two study employed a pretest-posttest comparison group design with 236 treatment group students and 41 comparison group stu- dents. Intact classrooms were used, reducing the threats of reactive arrange- ments. This design controls for \xe2\x80\x9cthe main effects of history, maturation, testing and instrumentation\xe2\x80\x9d (Campbell and Stanley, 1963, p. 48).\nIn year two, groups were pretested prior to training and posttested after the training was complete. The research team conducted all of the testing. The Student Attitude About Conflict (SAAC) served as a criterion measure. This test was used to assess effectiveness of conflict resolution strategies in the classroom. Developed by the New Mexico Center for Dis- pute Resolution to measure the effects of a statewide conflict resolution education initiative, the SAAC is comprised of thirty-two items that were selected after determining their reliability (Jenkins and Smith, 1992). Their study involved twelve hundred fourth through twelfth grade stu- dents in New Mexico public schools during the 1986\xe2\x80\x9387 school year. The item-total correlations were examined, and items with values less than twenty were discarded, resulting in the final version of thirty-two items.\nCONFLICT RESOLUTION QUARTERLY \xe2\x80\xa2 DOI: 10.1002/crq\n                                        60 HEYDENBERK, HEYDENBERK, TZENOVA\nFactor analytic procedures were used to assess the construct validity of the SAAC. As a result of the factor analytic procedures, four underlying factors corresponding to four clusters of items were identified. These underlying factors were labeled as the four subscales of this instrument. The four subscales that were identified by the test developers are the Conflict Reso- lution subscale, the Social Skills subscale, the Peer Relations subscale, and the School Attachment subscale (Jenkins and Smith, 1992).\nIn addition to the SAAC, the posttest-only instrument from year one was modified and used in a pretest-posttest version during year two of the study. Designed with high content validity, the additional customized instrument measured multiple program effects, including bully-victim rates, skill development, use of strategies, sense of school safety, and use of new skills and strategies outside of the classroom (skills transfer rate).\nThe research team comprised two university professors and one gradu- ate student in a conflict resolution program in another university, none of whom was involved with program implementation in the study under consideration. The researchers read all items from the instruments to stu- dents to accommodate a range of reading and oral vocabulary abilities within the classes. Furthermore, questions regarding vocabulary were answered by the researchers to ensure valid responses to items. All student responses were coded and anonymous. The classroom teachers were in the room during the administration of the aforementioned instruments to provide student assistance when indicated.\nIn addition to using student instruments and questionnaires in the treatment and control groups, teachers responded to a questionnaire related to program effectiveness and changes in student behavior. The Critical Incident technique was employed. It asked teachers to list the three most significant positive changes in their classrooms as a result of the conflict resolution training and the three weakest elements of the program.\nTreatment\nTraining was conducted by two Peace Center trainers. The Peace Center is a nonprofit conflict resolution education organization with a twenty-year history of providing programs to more than 150 schools. The two Peace Center trainers held advanced degrees in conflict resolution and education.

Other sessions were designed to increase self-regulation, empathy, and conflict resolution skills by using activities such as the STAR (Stop, Think, Act, and Review) strategy and the Peaceful Being strategy. The Check-In strategy was used at the beginning of most training sessions.\nThe Check-In\nThe verbal Check-In allows students to briefly communicate about their feelings at the beginning of each school day. One by one students verbalize their feelings and share events in their lives\xe2\x80\x94a pet dying, a karate award won, a trip to visit relatives. Students may decline to check in if they wish to do so. The Check-In encourages students to explore their feelings and to disclose them appropriately to others. The Check-In simultaneously teaches I-messages (I feel . . .) and affective vocabulary (or feeling words), for example, \xe2\x80\x9cI feel scared today because my sister is having surgery\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cI feel happy because I\xe2\x80\x99m going to my grandmother\xe2\x80\x99s house tonight.\xe2\x80\x9d Stu- dents were not permitted to use I-statements to complain about a specific person or blame anyone for how they were feeling, such as, \xe2\x80\x9cI feel angry when Tony laughs at me.\xe2\x80\x9d Also prohibited were certain overused vocabu- lary choices such as tired, hot, cold, or sleepy, which describe a physical state rather than a feeling.\nAlthough the Check-In was designed primarily to increase affective vocabulary and self-awareness of emotions and to provide practice of I-statements, the activity also helps students to increase empathy and under- standing of their classmates\xe2\x80\x99 lives. The Check-In has been found to increase school and class empathy and attachment (Heydenberk and Heydenberk, 2000), providing an additional significant benefit to students\xe2\x80\x99 resilience (Hawkins, 1995). After its introduction to treatment students, the Check- In was conducted at the opening of all training sessions.\nPeaceful Being\nTreatment group students used cardboard to make student life-sized silhouette figures. The cardboard figures were called Peaceful Beings to avoid gender assignment. Students were then asked to provide examples of positive or negative social behaviors. For each negative behavior (name- calling, insults, or pushing, for instance), students were asked to think of an alternative peaceful behavior such as giving compliments or saying kind words. The peaceful behaviors were written on the Peaceful Being, which\nCONFLICT RESOLUTION QUARTERLY \xe2\x80\xa2 DOI: 10.1002/crq\n                                        62 HEYDENBERK, HEYDENBERK, TZENOVA\nwas then placed on the wall to serve as an ongoing reminder of appropri- ate interactions with others. In class discussions, students reviewed the Peaceful Being and related behaviors with their classroom teachers. Stu- dents added pro-social behaviors to the Peaceful Being as the program advanced. Students drew individual Peaceful Beings in their Peace Journals and added to their lists of pro-social strategies in that context as well.\nThe Emotional Cup\nThe Emotional Cup activity asked students to create a small origami paper cup. Students discussed their feeling words (from the affective vocabulary list generated during the Check-In) and wrote them on colorful pieces of paper. The feeling words were kept in the cup. The trainers then intro- duced an emotional brain metaphor of the cup overflowing just as emotions may when the emotional brain is aroused.\nStop, Think, Act, and Review\nThe STAR activity served as a tool to remind students to stop and think. The activity invited them to engage in self-regulation and to use conflict resolution skills when they felt emotionally overwhelmed by anger or frustration. Essentially a metacognitive strategy, the STAR activity embodied elements of other lessons: recognizing emotions, considering others\xe2\x80\x99 emotions, acting as a Peaceful Being, and choosing a response rather than an angry reaction when stressed.\nWeb of Life, Torn Heart, and Picket Fence\nThe Web of Life activity asks students to toss a ball of yarn to a classmate while standing in a circle. A student who catches the yarn is given a com- pliment by the student who tossed the yarn. This game serves as a team- building activity. Other team-building activities were designed to increase empathy. The Torn Heart and the Picket Fence activities both tell stories that reveal the consequences of negatively resolved conflict. Directed discussion was used with the class to explore the importance of resolving conflicts after reading the stories.\nFindings\nThe year-one pilot study evaluation of 437 elementary students revealed the following:\nCONFLICT RESOLUTION QUARTERLY \xe2\x80\xa2 DOI: 10.1002/crq\n                                        Conflict Resolution and Bully Prevention 63\nSeventy-six percent of students reported feeling safer in school. Seventy-four percent of students reported that they were better at\nstaying out of fights.\nEighty-four percent of students reported less bullying in their\nclassroom.\nSixty-eight percent of students reported using skills routinely both in\nand outside of the school environment.\nSixty-seven percent of students reported improved peer\nrelationships.\nThe year-two study of 236 students in treatment classrooms revealed the following:\nSeventy-six percent of students reported feeling safer in school. Seventy-six percent of students reported that they were better at\nstaying out of fights.\nEighty percent of students reported less bullying in their\nclassroom.\nSeventy percent of students reported using skills routinely both in\nand outside of the school environment.\nSeventy-nine percent of students reported improved peer relationships.\nThe year-two study included measures of pretest to posttest changes on the SAAC for 148 fourth grade students and 88 third grade students. The mean scores of the fourth grade treatment students showed positive changes from pretest of 33.93 to a posttest score of 34.63. The mean scores of the third grade treatment group rose from 33.69 prior to treatment to 34.19 after treatment. No pre- to posttest SAAC gains were found in comparison classrooms. Both third grade treatment groups (t   2.454, p   .05, n   88, df   87) and fourth grade treatment groups (t   2.894, p   .05, n   148, df   147) showed statistically significant increases on the conflict resolu- tion subscale of the SAAC.\nThe students reported a high skill transfer rate (over 65 percent) in both years of the study, citing the STAR and the Emotional Cup strategies as those most often used to avoid verbal and physical aggression both in and out of the school environment. Peaceful Being and Torn Heart were\nCONFLICT RESOLUTION QUARTERLY \xe2\x80\xa2 DOI: 10.1002/crq\n                                        64 HEYDENBERK, HEYDENBERK, TZENOVA\nthird and fourth on the students\xe2\x80\x99 list of strategies used to avoid negative interaction. During both years of the study, students rated the Web of Life and the Check-In activities as their favorite activities. However, the Web of Life activity was not listed by any of the 585 treatment students in the sample as an activity used beyond the training sessions. Several stu- dents reported reflecting on the Check-In (I-messages) to remind them how to communicate during the conflict resolution process; however, none of those students used the Check-In strategy alone. Therefore, the Check-In may have provided essential affective vocabulary that formed the foundation of the conflict resolution process, but it was not typically used outside of the classroom activity time.\nDuring both years, all but one of the treatment teachers reported decreased bullying, increased pro-social behaviors, and decreased time spent on conflict, as represented by the following comments:\nEach lesson provided my class with a valuable resource of vocabulary to use. It also provided opportunities for practice and expression of skills we are learning in the classroom.\nWe love the Check-In. It enabled our students to voice their feelings. This is something we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue in our classroom.\nThis program will give students a reference point when a difficult situation arises. It will give me a chance to have deeper discussions when I witness or hear about a bullying incident.\nThe chance for students to think about the issues discussed weekly was very valuable. They looked forward to having the meeting weekly.\nI feel the bullying program empowered students to feel confident in speaking up for themselves, and the students are less intimidated at the thought of confrontation and conflict resolution.\nI feel, for my own classroom, it helps a great deal to be able to remind students of what we learned in regard to specific lessons. In other words, if a problem arises, such as name-calling, I can remind them of the Torn Heart.\nFew criticisms were offered by teachers, all of which related to program scheduling. For instance, teachers felt that students resented lessons that interfered with recess time and suggested that the sessions be scheduled more frequently.\nCONFLICT RESOLUTION QUARTERLY \xe2\x80\xa2 DOI: 10.1002/crq\n                                        Conflict Resolution and Bully Prevention 65 Implications and Conclusions\nThe conflict resolution program reduced verbal and physical bullying and increased pro-social problem solving and a sense of safety. All teachers in the treatment groups reported decreased time spent on student conflicts.\nTeachers and students reported increased use of conflict resolution skills and decreased fighting, and the Conflict Resolution subscale scores on the SAAC corroborated these findings. If reviewed and practiced, the self-regulation gains and problem-solving gains may be strong predictors of other significant benefits.\nMeta-analysis of educational research (Wang, 1992) has shown that students\xe2\x80\x99 metacognitive competencies (the ability to stop and review one\xe2\x80\x99s own thinking) and self-regulation skills explained a significant part of the difference between high-achieving at-risk youth and their low-achieving counterparts. Furthermore, research has shown that the increased self-regulation fostered in a comprehensive conflict resolution program is related to increases in students\xe2\x80\x99 metacognitive competence (Heydenberk and Heydenberk, 2005). These findings set the stage for improved academic achievement, as found in earlier research (Johnson and Johnson, 1996; Wentzel, Weinberger, Ford, and Feldman, 1990; Wentzel, 1991a; Zins, Weissberg, Wang, and Walberg, 2004). Approximately 70 percent of students used their conflict resolution skills outside of the classroom.\nContrary to frequently held assumptions, bullies usually have good self-esteem, but they are less able to empathize and self-regulate (Olweus, 1997). Both of these deficits take their toll on bullies as well as their victims. By the time bullies are young adults, \xe2\x80\x9cthe former school bullies [have] a fourfold increase in the level of relatively serious recidivist criminality as documented in official crime records\xe2\x80\x9d (Olweus, 1997, p. 178) Therefore, the outcomes of increased empathy and reduced bullying behavior are positive markers for both bullies and their victims.\nThis evidence of skill transfer in treatment classrooms suggests that students internalized learning and that they will continue to use conflict resolution strategies in different contexts in their lives.\nStudents\xe2\x80\x99 assessment of schoolwide bullying was unchanged or increased slightly in both the comparison and treatment groups; however, in the treatment groups, more than 80 percent of students reported that treatment group classmates engaged in less fighting and bullying within\nCONFLICT RESOLUTION QUARTERLY \xe2\x80\xa2 DOI: 10.1002/crq\n                                        66 HEYDENBERK, HEYDENBERK, TZENOVA\nthe classroom, and students felt safer in their classrooms. This finding suggests that, as in other studies (Newman and Horne, 2004), bullying prevention programs can succeed at the classroom level if school-level implementation is not possible. This finding adds support to the usual practice of starting small programs within schools, often the only practical alternative to a schoolwide program implementation. The cost of this pro- gram ($600 per classroom) is minimal, especially considering that teachers can reinforce the activities in future years without the expense of engaging outside personnel.\nAlthough school bullying has serious consequences, much of the behavior may occur in hallways, restrooms, bus lines, and recess areas, away from teachers and staff. Students\xe2\x80\x99 self-reports of increased safety and decreased bullying are particularly significant in light of these findings.\nSpecific activities should be examined to determine those that are most effective and at what grade levels. In this study there appeared to be an inverse relationship between the activities students cited as favorites and the activities they used in conflict situations. Therefore, curriculum designers should not trust student enthusiasm about activities alone to guide their selection of activities without examining their actual use in and outside of the classroom. Furthermore, specific activities cited as most useful in this study may be ineffective because they are too difficult for primary-level students. For instance, the STAR activity was too abstract and apparently included too many steps for kindergarten and first grade students to use effectively, even though they gave it a high interest rating (Heydenberk, Heydenberk, Williams, and Pelly, forthcoming). Students are sensitive to activities that they perceive to be childish. For instance, the Circle of Peace activity, which provided students with a brightly col- ored plastic ring to hold while using the steps of conflict resolution, was a very effective tool for kindergarten and first grade students, but it was rebuffed by third- and fourth-grade students (Heydenberk, Heydenberk, Williams, and Pelly, forthcoming).\nFinally, although several of the activities that were noted as students\xe2\x80\x99 favorites were not those used to resolve conflicts, the students\xe2\x80\x99 favorite activities may be valuable for program success. Students\xe2\x80\x99 favorite activi- ties may increase trust, interest, and student understanding, making these activities essential program components. Isolated or stand-alone approaches to conflict resolution such as posting the steps of conflict resolution or posting behavioral rules without discussion and reflection are seldom effective in changing student behaviors (Heydenberk and\nCONFLICT RESOLUTION QUARTERLY \xe2\x80\xa2 DOI: 10.1002/crq\n                                        Conflict Resolution and Bully Prevention 67\nHeydenberk, 2005). While such approaches supply the cognitive bases of appropriate social behavior and the specific steps of conflict resolution, they may not generate interest or positive student attitudes toward new behaviors without first building a foundation of trust, affective vocabu- lary, and empathy. Simply posting the steps of conflict resolution is seldom effective in fostering use of skills or transfer of these skills. In research conducted on third- and fourth-grade students in urban Philadelphia (Heydenberk and Heydenberk, 2005) students given the useful conflict resolution strategies (for instance, STAR) in a stand-alone program showed no change in behavior or attitudes as measured by pre- to posttest changes on the SAAC. However, when students in the same school were given the conflict resolution strategies in the context of an integrated approach (which included team building and increased affec- tive vocabulary from the Check-In activity), they showed statistically sig- nificant positive changes in their ability to resolve conflicts (Heydenberk and Heydenberk, 2005).\nIn schools that are pressured to meet high academic standards, teachers may be tempted simply to provide students with the steps of conflict reso- lution, such as the STAR activity, without the other foundation activities that are necessary for success. Unfortunately, learning the conflict resolu- tion steps alone often does not change student attitudes or behavior. A bal- anced approach that includes activities to increase affective vocabulary and empathy and that promotes skill development may, in the long run, be an efficient use of school time by reducing time spent on conflicts, increasing school attachment and achievement.\nReferences\nAspy, C., Oman, R., Vesely, S.

Smith, Helen Cowie, Ragnar F. Olafsson, and Andy P. D. Liefooghe\nwith the collaboration of Ana Almeida, Hozumi Araki, Cristina del Barrio, Angela Costabile, Bojan Dekleva, Anastasia Houndoumadi, Kenneth Kim, Ragnar P. Olafsson, Rosario Ortega, Jacques Pain, Lena Pateraki, Mechthild Schafer, Monika Singer, Andrea Smorti, Yuichi Toda, Helgi Tomasson, and Zhang Wenxin\nThe study of school bullying has recently assumed an international dimension, but is faced with difficulties in finding terms in different languages to correspond to the English word bullying. To investigate the meanings given to various terms, a set of 25 stick-figure cartoons was devised, covering a range of social situations be- tween peers. These cartoons were shown to samples of 8- and 14-year-old pupils (N   1,245; n   604 at 8 years, n   641 at 14 years) in schools in 14 different countries, who judged whether various native terms cognate to bullying, applied to them. Terms from 10 Indo-European languages and three Asian languages were sampled. Multidimensional scaling showed that 8-year-olds primarily discriminated nonaggressive and aggressive car- toon situations; however, 14-year-olds discriminated fighting from physical bullying, and also discriminated verbal bullying and social exclusion. Gender differences were less appreciable than age differences. Based on the 14-year-old data, profiles of 67 words were then constructed across the five major cartoon clusters. The main types of terms used fell into six groups: bullying (of all kinds), verbal plus physical bullying, solely ver- bal bullying, social exclusion, solely physical aggression, and mainly physical aggression. The findings are dis- cussed in relation to developmental trends in how children understand bullying, the inferences that can be made from cross-national studies, and the design of such studies.\nINTRODUCTION\nSince the publication of Olweus\xe2\x80\x99s book Aggression in the Schools, in 1978, there has been a growing interest in the topic of school bullying. Spreading from Scan- dinavia to other western European countries, the United States, and Australia and New Zealand, and with a somewhat independent research tradition in Japan on ijime, the research and preventive action on this phenomenon has now reached an international dimension (Smith, Morita, et al., 1999). Correspond- ingly, there is a need to examine the use of the word bullying and cognate terms in a variety of languages, at an international level, to understand fully the sim- ilarities and differences in the phenomenon across different countries and language groups. In any cul- ture, the issue of definition is central for accurate sta- tistics on the incidence of bullying; the study of devel- opmental changes in perceptions of bullying on the part of children, adolescents and adults; the evalua- tion of the effectiveness of different interventions to combat it; and clarification of individual rights and legal responsibilities (Ananiadou & Smith, in press). Because comparisons are attempted at cross-national levels, the definition of corresponding terms in differ- ent languages becomes essential for the interpretation of cross-national findings. The present study exam-\nined the meaning attached to the term bullying, and related terms, in 14 countries and 13 major languages (10 Indo-European, 3 Asiatic), as well as age and gen- der differences related to this issue.\nThe Definition of Bullying\nHeinemann (1973) was one of the first to write on the phenomenon of bullying. He used the Norwegian term mobbning, referring to group violence against a deviant individual that occurs suddenly and subsides suddenly. This confines the process to actions carried out by a group against an individual, as does the En- glish word mobbing. A similar use of the concept of mobbing also appears in the German literature (Niedl, 1996). Olweus (1978, 1993) at first used this term, but subsequently extended the definition to in- clude systematic one-on-one attacks of a stronger child against a weaker child.\nThe emphasis of earlier work on bullying was on physical bullying and verbal taunting done directly by the bully or bullies to the victim. Olweus\xe2\x80\x99s earlier (1978) work did not fully recognize the extent of indi- rect bullying. However, the importance of indirect\n\xc2\xa9 2002 by the Society for Research in Child Development, Inc. All rights reserved. 0009-3920/2002/7304-0009\n1120 Child Development\naggression as a category was shown by the research of Bjo\xcc\x88rkqvist and colleagues (Bjo\xcc\x88rkqvist, Lagerspetz, & Kaukiainen, 1992) in Finland. They distinguished direct physical aggression (such as punching) and direct verbal aggression (such as name calling), as well as indirect aggression. Indirect aggression, characterized by its somewhat covert nature and use of third par- ties, had principal forms of gossiping and spreading rumors, and social exclusion (deliberately not allow- ing a person into a group). Somewhat similar (al- though not identical) concepts have been described by Crick and colleagues (Crick, Casas, & Mosher, 1997; Crick & Grotpeter, 1995, 1996) as relational aggres- sion, and by Galen and Underwood (1997) as social aggression; these relate more to the consequences of the negative act and the intent to damage relation- ships. There are corresponding forms of physical, verbal, and indirect or relational bullying (Rivers & Smith, 1994).\nCurrently, Olweus (1999, pp. 10\xe2\x80\x9311) states that \xe2\x80\x9cbullying is thus characterized by the following three criteria: (1) it is aggressive behavior or intentional \xe2\x80\x98harmdoing\xe2\x80\x99 (2) which is carried out repeatedly and over time (3) in an interpersonal relationship charac- terized by an imbalance of power. One might add that the bullying behavior often occurs without apparent provocation,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cnegative actions can be carried out by physical contact, by words, or in other ways, such as making faces or mean gestures, and inten- tional exclusion from a group.\xe2\x80\x9d This kind of defini- tion of the term bullying is now accepted by many re- searchers (Farrington, 1993; Smith & Sharp, 1994).\nSuch a definition labels bullying as a subset of ag- gressive behavior. Aggressive behavior, in turn, is often defined as negative acts carried out intention- ally to harm another; thus, behavior that accidentally harms another would not be aggressive. The issue of whether the aggressive behavior is provoked, or in some sense justified, is less clearly resolved. Olweus stated that \xe2\x80\x9cthe bullying behavior often occurs with- out apparent provocation,\xe2\x80\x9d but some researchers (no- tably Pikas, 1989) have suggested that there is a cate- gory of \xe2\x80\x9cprovocative victims\xe2\x80\x9d who play an active part in \xe2\x80\x9cinviting\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cperpetuating\xe2\x80\x9d the bullying behavior.\nAn earlier form of the Olweus definition (1993), ex- tended slightly by Whitney and Smith (1993, p. 7) in their English language version, prefaces the adminis- tration of recent versions of his questionnaire:\nWe say a young person is being bullied, or picked on, when another child or young person, or a group of young people, say nasty and unpleasant things to him or her. It is also bullying when a young person is hit, kicked or threatened, locked\ninside a room, sent nasty notes, when no-one ever talks to them and things like that. These things can happen frequently and it is difficult for the young person being bullied to defend himself or herself. It is also bullying when a young person is teased re- peatedly in a nasty way. But it is not bullying when two young people of about the same strength have the odd fight or quarrel.\nThis definition specifies that bullying is an aggres- sive act. In addition, it suggests an imbalance of power (the victim finds it difficult to defend himself or herself) and some element of repetition (these things can happen frequently). These two additional criteria serve to distinguish bullying as a subset of the broader concept of aggression. Notably, two sorts of actions are labeled as not being bullying: the odd fight or quarrel between two young people of about the same strength, which is aggression, is explicitly not bullying because it fails the above two additional cri- teria. The definition also implicitly labels friendly forms of teasing as not being bullying; teasing is a rather ambiguous behavior, but in friendly teasing there would not be an intent to harm, whereas in nasty teasing there would be.\nThere is now widespread use of the Olweus ques- tionnaire, and similar survey instruments, on an in- ternational basis (Morita, Smith, Junger-Tas, Olweus, & Catalano, 1999; Smith et al., 1999). A modified ver- sion has been used in a cross-national comparative survey of five countries (Japan, England, The Nether- lands, Norway, and the United States) funded by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the Japanese Ministry of Education, Science, Sports, and Culture (Mon- busho; Junger-Tas & van Kesteren, 1999; Morita, 1999; Smith & Shu, 2000). One aim of such international co- operation is to compare the frequency and structural characteristics of bullying in different societies, to bet- ter understand and then plan interventions to reduce the harmful consequences that bullying can have.\nThe Implications of Cross-National Research on Bullying\nA difficulty facing cross-national comparisons is the comparability of terminology. Arora (1996) drew attention to the various terms cognate with bullying in English and in several other languages. The study of bullying in a number of different countries indi- cates that the word bully is not easy to translate (Genta, Menesini, Fonzi, Costabile, & Smith, 1996; Morita, 1996; O\xe2\x80\x99Connell, Pepler, & Craig, 1999; Rigby & Slee, 1991). Different terms are used both in any one\nlanguage and in different languages. The terms bully and mobbing are familiar in the Scandinavian and Germanic languages, including English (the etymol- ogy of the word bully probably coming from the Mid- dle Dutch word boele meaning first sweetheart, then fine fellow, then blusterer; Encarta World English Dic- tionary, 1999). The word bully is familiar in other English-speaking cultures such as the United States, although less widely used (Hazler, 1996); in the United States the terms victimization and peer rejec- tion are often used to denote negative actions of peers toward another young person (Asher & Coie, 1990). Words for bullying are less familiar in the Latin lan- guages; for example, the French have no direct trans- lation of the word.\nThe importance of the terms used can be illustrated within one language, English. The terms bully and bullying have been in usage for a long time, to de- scribe this kind of behavior in children at school (as in Tom Brown\xe2\x80\x99s Schooldays; Hughes, 1857/1989). The term teasing is similar but can have a milder connota- tion of verbal and possibly playful aggression. An- other term, harassment, appears similar to bullying but tends to be used for adult or adolescent rather than child behaviors, as in sexual harassment, or ra- cial harassment. Yet another term, abuse, also appears similar but tends to be restricted to the family context, as in parent\xe2\x80\x93child abuse or spousal abuse, or to adult\xe2\x80\x93 child contexts, as in physical abuse or sexual abuse. These terms have somewhat different dictionary def- initions and, more importantly, they may be under- stood differently by persons answering questionnaires.\nThis issue is also highlighted when questionnaires such as the Olweus questionnaire are translated into different languages. Frequently there is not an exact translation of the term bullying. The Japanese term most equivalent to bullying appears to be ijime, which has been the subject of a rather independent research tradition in Japan, through the 1980s and 1990s (Morita, Soeda, Soeda, & Taki, 1999). However, Morita, Soeda, et al. (1999) consider that ijime does differ somewhat from bullying, in having a less physically violent connotation, and a relatively greater emphasis on social manipulation and more female types of ag- gressive behavior. In contrast, in Italy, the Italian words prepotenza and violenza tend to imply more physical, violent actions (Fonzi et al., 1999).\nThe issue of comparability of terms is central for the accurate interpretation of national and cross-national findings. Exact matching of terms across languages is an unrealizable ideal, but it is necessary to know how comparable terms are, and, if they differ, on which dimensions or criteria (e.g., physical/psychological, direct/indirect, group/individual, and so forth) the\ndifference is primarily located. Even if a fuller explicit definition is given (as in the Olweus questionnaire), the favored term (bullying, ijime, prepotenza, and so forth) is used throughout the questionnaire, and in summaries and wider discussion; and respondents to the questionnaire may well refer to their personal def- inition of this term rather than that given early on by the researcher (Arora, 1996; Madsen, 1997).\nIn the present study\xe2\x80\x99s comparison of the meaning of different terms, the intention was not to \xe2\x80\x9cprivilege\xe2\x80\x9d any particular term or language, but rather to show the kinds of situational meanings attributed to each term. However, given a current strong position of En- glish language in scientific discourse, and the wide- spread use of the term bullying (including its co- option as, e.g., bullismo in Italian; Fonzi, 1997), there may be particular interest in comparing other lan- guage terms for their similarity/dissimilarity to the English term bullying.\nSuch information is also important for the study of developmental changes in perceptions of bullying. There is evidence for developmental differences in the ways in which pupils construe bullying (Madsen, 1997; Smith & Levan, 1995; Smith, Madsen, & Moody, 1999). Younger pupils may not distinguish between bullying and fighting, broadening the use of the term bullying to cover nasty kinds of behavior even when no imbalance of power is involved. Younger, Schwartz- man, and Ledingham (1985) compared children\xe2\x80\x99s per- ceptions of aggression, withdrawal, and likability items in Canadian children approximately 6, 9, and 12 years of age. Using multidimensional scaling (MDS) techniques, they found a shift with age from a simple evaluative dimension and low cohesiveness of clus- ters (high structure ratios in the MDS) to a more com- plex separation of clusters with an additional active\xe2\x80\x93 passive dimension, and higher within-cluster item cohesiveness (lower structure ratios).\nIt is also possible that there are gender differences in perceptions of bullying and related terms. This is an issue, given the well-established gender differ- ences found in the use of direct and indirect or phys- ical and psychological forms of aggression, including bullying (Bjo\xcc\x88rkqvist et al., 1992; Crick & Grotpeter, 1995, 1996; Rivers & Smith, 1994). Although little evi- dence has been found thus far for gender differences in the understanding of aggression and bullying (Madsen, 1997), as opposed to their use, the possibil- ity of them emerging should be investigated.\nAims of the Present Study\nThis study examined the understanding of a variety of terms cognate to bullying, in 14 countries, includ-\nSmith et al. 1121\n1122 Child Development\ning 13 major languages. Understanding was opera- tionalized in terms of applicability of a selection of 25 stick-figure cartoons that displayed situations that might or might not be bullying, based on various well-used criteria. Age differences were examined by giving the task to primary school children (8 years of age) and secondary school children (14 years of age); samples were balanced for gender to also allow for male\xe2\x80\x93female comparisons.\nMETHOD\nThe Cartoons Task\nWe first developed a series of 25 stick-figure car- toon pictures (see Table 1) that illustrated different sit- uations that might or might not be bullying, based on elements used in existing definitions of bullying (Smith, 1999). Most of the cartoons portrayed nega- tive acts; however, two prosocial cartoons (10, 18) were included. Two other nonaggressive cartoons were paired with corresponding aggressive ones: one (8) showed a negative but accidental act and was con- trasted with one (9) in which a similar act was inten- tional; the other (16) showed friendly verbal teasing and was contrasted with one (17) that depicted simi- lar teasing that upset the recipient. One cartoon (4) re- ferred to provoked aggression. The remaining car- toons covered physical forms of aggression (1\xe2\x80\x937), direct verbal aggression (11\xe2\x80\x9315), social exclusion ag- gression (19\xe2\x80\x9323), and indirect relational aggression (24, 25); however, embedded in these were compari- sons of the defining criteria of bullying, namely repe- tition and imbalance of power. Thus, repetition was made explicit in some cartoons (5, 12, 20), and imbal- ance of power in others (3, 7, 21). Themes such as rac- ism (13), sexism (22, 23), and discrimination on the basis of disability (14) or sexual orientation (15) were also included.\nThe cartoons were piloted extensively before the set was finalized. Stick figures were used so as to avoid issues of clothing, which might vary by culture, and to avoid suggesting any particular ethnic group or skin color. Thus, identical pictures were used across all cultures. Each cartoon had a caption in the native language, as listed in Table 1 for the English language version (boys). In each language, one set of cartoons had captions with typical boys\xe2\x80\x99 names in the country concerned, and a corresponding set had cap- tions with typical girls\xe2\x80\x99 names; cartoons 22 and 23 were in common to both gender sets. Examples of four cartoons (3 and 10 from the boys\xe2\x80\x99 set, 14 and 21 from the girls\xe2\x80\x99 set) are shown in Figure 1.\nThe cartoon captions were descriptive (see Table 1)\nTable 1 Captions for the 25 Cartoons (Male Version)\n1.

In each other country, a researcher translated these captions into the main native language as used by participants in the task. These captions were then back-translated into English by another person, and returned to the first author in London, who then checked them against the original versions and dis- cussed any discrepancies until these were resolved.\nAll 25 cartoons were used identically in all 14 countries, with the exception of cartoons 13 and 15. If color of skin was not an important factor in a culture, an alternate caption about saying nasty things about a child talking in a different way was used for cartoon 13. In addition, in some countries permission was not readily forthcoming from schools to use cartoon 15, which was on sexual orientation (usually with 8-year- olds, but occasionally with 14-year-olds as well); thus, the cartoon was omitted from the main cross-national analyses.\nGeneral Procedure\nResearchers in all 14 countries followed an agreed- on three-step procedure.\n  \nFigure 1 Examples of four of the cartoons: Numbers 3 and 10 from the boys\xe2\x80\x99 set, and 14 and 21 from the girls\xe2\x80\x99 set.\nStep 1: List and select terms for bullying and social ex- clusion in the relevant language. Likely terms to use in the investigation were taken from dictionaries and thesauruses, questionnaires on bullying translated into the language, and research and popular writings on the topic. Some 5 to 10 terms were then chosen, on the basis of meaning and applicability across the country/culture, to proceed to Step 2.\nStep 2: Use focus groups with children to check on usage and broad understanding of terms. At least two focus groups were held, each consisting of at least four (usu- ally more) 8-year-olds and four (usually more) 14-year- olds. The ostensible aim for the participants was to generate words that were currently used to describe antisocial/aggressive behaviors and situations at school. To engage participants in debate, a subset of the cartoons was employed as stimulus materials. For the purposes of the study, the aim was to ensure that terms selected for Step 3 were spontaneously used by some participants, and were broadly familiar to most participants.\nIt was recognized that this work could not often be done on a varied sample across different sites in a country (although some research teams did use two sites). However, dialect terms that sometimes ap- peared, but were local to a region within a country, were not selected for Step 3.\nThe intention was to end up with four to six terms for Step 3. Often, more terms were used and under- stood by 14-year-olds than 8-year-olds. In such cases, all terms were used with the 14-year-old sample, but only the subset of those terms that were understood by 8-year-olds were used with the younger sample. As an example from the English data, pilot work and focus groups with children established that relevant terms in English, besides bullying, included teasing, picking on, tormenting, harassment, and intimidation. All these terms were used and understood by 14-year-olds. However, only bullying, teasing, and picking on were readily understood by 8-year-olds, and thus only these three terms were used with this age group.\nStep 3: Sorting task using cartoons to delineate ways in\nSmith et al. 1123\n \n1124 Child Development\nwhich these terms are used. The work was carried out in school settings, with children withdrawn from class on an individual basis (for all 8-year-olds; in some countries the 14-year-old data were obtained on a class basis). Of the terms selected for investigation, each was taken in turn. Children were shown or given the cartoons, with the researcher also reading the cap- tion in the case of 8-year-olds. Gender-appropriate cartoon sets were used. For each term, children were required to either include or exclude each cartoon in their definition of the term with which they were pre- sented. This was done by sorting them in a pile under the heading: \xe2\x80\x9cthis is X\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cthis is not X\xe2\x80\x9d (where X was the term being currently considered); or, in class pre- sentation with older children, by checking a standard score sheet appropriately. The procedure was repeated until all terms were investigated. The captions were given in the order shown in Table 1. This was done to maximize consistency across cultures, and to give a \xe2\x80\x9cnarrative\xe2\x80\x9d line to the task, as children moved through physical, verbal, and more indirect/relational scenar- ios. The possible drawback of order effects was recog- nized, but pilot work suggested that a random order was more confusing for the children to follow.\nParticipants\nThe sorting task in Step 3 was given to a minimum of 20 boys and 20 girls each at 8 years and 14 years of age(totalN 1,245;n 604at8years,n 641at14 years). They were selected from schools that were deemed reasonably representative of the education system in that country; that is, they were not drawn from extreme groups in terms of academic ability, or socioeconomic status. In all cases there were nearly equal numbers of boys and girls at each age group (exactly equal unless stated). Sample sizes are shown in Table 2, together with the district of the country from which they were recruited via local schools. Table 2 also shows the number of terms used for both 8-year-olds and 14-year-olds (only one term was available from the French team; due to a misunder- standing of instructions they chose the one term most similar to bullying, from those terms used in the focus groups with French pupils).\nRESULTS\nSPSS 10.0 for Windows was used for statistical purposes.\nStructure of Responses to the Cartoons\nThe percentage of participants who included each of the 24 cartoons (cartoon 15 was excluded, see\nMethod section) as part of their \xe2\x80\x9cdefinition\xe2\x80\x9d of each term was computed. The similarity or difference be- tween any two cartoons could be assessed by com- paring their percentage profiles. This permitted an analysis of the structure of the cartoon set, over all re- spondents. To this end, MDS was conducted, using datasets from all 14 countries.1\nGenders were combined, but analyses were sepa- rated for the 8- and 14-year-olds, using the 47 terms that were common to both age groups so that the two age groups could be compared on the same set of terms. Scores were averaged for each country before aggregating (correcting for minor differences in sample size). The MDS was run on SPSS, minimizing Young\xe2\x80\x99s stress. No transformations were carried out. The Manhattan proximity measure was employed to cre- ate a single distance matrix between cartoons, the dis- tance between two items being the sum of the abso- lute differences between the values (percentages) for the items (cartoons). The matrix is square symmetric. An ordinal MDS model was specified, using Kruskal\xe2\x80\x99s (1964a, 1964b) least squares monotonic transforma- tion. The Euclidean distance model was used. The Kruskal stress values (Formula 1) for one-, two-, three-, and four-dimensional solutions, respectively, were .08, .05, .03, and .01 for 8-year-olds; and .14, .08, .03, and .02 for 14-year-olds. These low values suggested two-dimensional solutions were adequate for both age groups. The MDS solutions for each age group are shown in Figures 2 and 3.\nThe MDS solutions for the 8- and 14-year-olds, re- spectively, were similar in overall structure; both showed on Dimension 1 (horizontal axis in figures) those cartoons that were not aggressive (prosocial, friendly teasing, accidental damage) at one end (left- hand side of figures) and cartoons of increasing ag- gression toward the other end (right-hand side of fig- ures), whereas the second dimension (vertical axis in figures) opposed physical cartoons (bottom of fig- ures) and verbal and social exclusion cartoons (top of figures). The somewhat lower stress value for the 8- year-olds (.05) indicates a better fit, and a simpler structure, than for the 14-year-olds (.08). This is seen\n1 Multidimensional scaling attempts to find the structure in a set of distance measures between objects or cases. This is accom- plished by assigning items to specific locations in a conceptual space (usually two or three dimensional) such that the distances between the points in space match the given dissimilarities as closely as possible. Points are arranged so that similar items are represented by points that are close together (proximities) and dissimilar items are represented by points that are far apart. The stress value of an MDS solution shows the degree of fit within the number of dimensions used, with smaller stress values meaning a better fit.\nTable 2\nDetails of the Samples, and Number of Terms Used, in each of 14 Countries\nCountry\nAustria China\nEngland France Germany\nGreece Iceland Italy Japan\nNorway\nPortugal Slovenia Spain Thailand\nLanguage\nSouth Germanic Mandarin Chinese\nNumber of Pupils at 8 Years\n40 50\nNumber of Pupils at 14 Years\n40 50\nNumber of Terms at 8 Years\n3 2\n3 1 3\n2 5 7 3\n2\n6 2 5 3\nNumber of Terms at 14 Years\n4 7\n6 1 4\n3 6 7 5\n4\n6 6 5 3\nDistrict of Sample\nStyria (southeast) and Lower Austria (northeast) Capital city of Shandong province, eastern\ncoastal area\nLondon area\nParis area\nMunich area in southern Germany\nAthens and Ioannina in northwest Greece Reykjavik area\nCrema and Cremona, northern Italy\nTottori and Tokyo, on main island of Honshu\nTrondheim area, middle coastal region of Norway\nBraga area in north Portugal\nLjubljana area\nSeville (south Spain) and Madrid (central Spain) Rural area near Lampang in north Thailand\nSmith et al. 1125\n  English 40 40 French 40 40 German 43 (22 boys, 51 (26 boys,\n21 girls) 25 girls) Greek 40 40 Icelandic 40 40 Italian 40 40\nJapanese\nNorwegian\nPortuguese Slovenian Spanish Thai\n51 (25 boys, 26 girls) 40\n40 40 60 40\n70 (37 boys, 33 girls) 40\n40 40 60 50\n  also by comparing Figures 2 and 3; the cartoons are bunched more closely in Figure 2, and are more spread out and differentiated in Figure 3. Although older children were using the same two dimensions to classify the cartoons, a greater level of differentia- tion was apparent; for example, the social exclusion items (19, 22, 23) were more clearly separated from the verbal items in this age group compared with the 8-year-olds.\nHierarchical cluster analyses2 were conducted on the same percentage profile data as the MDS solu- tions to identify distinct groups of cartoons. Ward\xe2\x80\x99s method was used to combine clusters. The distance matrix between cartoons was based on Euclidean dis- tance. These analyses further indicated a greater ca- pacity of the 14-year-olds to differentiate meaning in the cartoons. At the same level of distinctness, the so- lution for the 8-year-olds produced only two clusters, whereas the solution for the 14-year-olds showed five clusters. The solution for the 8-year-olds distin- guished between the nonaggressive cartoons (8, 10, 16, 18) on the one hand and the aggressive cartoons (all the rest) on the other. The five clusters produced\n2 Hierarchical cluster analysis attempts to identify relatively homogeneous groups of variables, using an algorithm that starts with each variable in a separate cluster and combines clusters until only one is left. By relating this to MDS, clusters can be mapped onto the MDS configuration in an attempt to identify common dimensions. Thus, the co-occurrence of items can be examined at the same time as the underlying dimensions on which they are arranged.\nFigure 2\nture for 8-year-olds.\nMultidimensional scaling solution of cartoon struc-\n Figure 3\nture for 14-year-olds.\nMultidimensional scaling solution of cartoon struc-\n1126 Child Development\n  Figure 4 Multidimensional scaling solution of cartoon struc- ture for boys.\nby the 14-year-olds, however, were nonaggressive (8, 10, 16, 18), social exclusion (19, 20, 21, 22, 23), verbal: direct indirect (11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 24, 25; and nine placed more distantly), physical aggression (1, 4), and physical bullying (2, 3, 5, 6, 7).\nGender Differences\nAn analysis of the structure of the cartoons, in both MDS (corresponding to Figures 2 and 3) and hierar- chical cluster analysis solutions, was carried out sep- arately for boys and girls. For this purpose, data from 8- and 14-year-olds were combined, and the anal- yses were run on 45 terms used by both age groups, from 13 countries (Norway was not included because labeling by gender had been omitted in data collec- tion). The Kruskal stress values for one-, two-, three- and four-dimensional solutions, respectively, were .12, .07, .03, and .01 for males; and .09, .05, .03, and .02 for females. These low values indicated that two-dimensional solutions were adequate for both genders.\nThe MDS solutions for both genders are shown in Figures 4 and 5. The overall structures were very sim- ilar; and, as described for Figures 2 and 3, the hori- zontal axis discriminated prosocial from aggressive cartoons, and the vertical axis opposed physical (bottom of figures) and verbal (middle of figures) aggression from social exclusion (top of figures).\nTo establish the extent of similarity more objec- tively, two hierarchical cluster analyses were con- ducted, one for each gender, on the same data used in the MDS solutions above. The specifications followed were identical to those used for the earlier age com- parisons. At the level of getting a five-cluster solution as discussed above, configurations were very similar.\nFigure 5 Multidimensional scaling solution of cartoon struc- ture for girls.\nFor both genders, there were clusters of nonaggres- sive (8, 10, 16, 18), social exclusion (19, 20, 21, 22, 23), and physical aggression (1, 4); both genders also had clusters of verbal:direct indirect (11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 24, 25), and physical bullying (2, 3, 5, 6, 7), with the only difference being that cartoon 9 (nonaccidentally breaking a ruler) was included in the physical bully- ing cluster for boys, but in the verbal:direct indirect cluster for girls.\nComparison of Terms on the Cartoon Cluster Structure\nTo compare terms on the cartoon cluster structure, a similar cluster analysis to that described above was used, but was based on data for all 67 terms defined by 14-year-olds, and not just the 47 also used by the 8-year-olds. This cluster analysis produced the same five main clusters, and a plot very similar to that shown in Figure 3: a nonaggressive cluster (8, 10, 16, 18) that included two prosocial items, plus friendly teasing and accidental damage; a social exclusion cluster (19, 20, 21, 22, 23) that included the five so- cial exclusion cartoons; a verbal:direct indirect cluster (9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 24, 25) that included the verbal cartoons, plus nasty teasing, and the two in- direct verbal cartoons, together with the accidental damage cartoon (9), which was intermediate between this cluster (where it technically fell) and the phys- ical bullying cluster (see Figure 3); a physical ag- gression cluster (1, 4) that included the two physi- cal cartoons that most clearly did not fit a definition of bullying\xe2\x80\x94an even-handed dispute and a pro- voked retaliation; and a physical bullying cluster (2, 3, 5, 6, 7) that generally implied some repetition or power imbalance.\nThe above clusters were used to simplify the mean- ing profiles of the 67 terms. A mean percentage score was computed for each term on each cluster. The meaning of each term could thus be expressed in 5 percentage scores, instead of 25. The outcome is pre- sented in Table 3. The range of scores for each cluster was 0 to 100. For example (taking the fourth line in Table 3), the term angreifen was only applied in 3% of responses to the nonaggressive cartoons (i.e., aver- aged over these four cartoons individually), and only 7% of the social exclusion and 11% of the verbal bul- lying cartoons, but it was applied to 74% of the phys- ical aggression cartoons, and 83% of the physical bul- lying cartoons; this indicates that the term angreifen is used for physical aggression and bullying but not for nonphysical forms. As expected, none of the terms scored highly on the nonaggressive cluster; however, there was considerable variation in weight- ing on the other four clusters, which showed differ- ences in meaning\xe2\x80\x94sometimes obvious, sometimes more subtle.\nConceptual Structure of Terms Used in Different Languages\nFor each term, the percentage of participants who included each of the 24 cartoons as part of their \xe2\x80\x9cdef- inition\xe2\x80\x9d of that term was computed. The meaning of each term was operationalized with regard to the mean percentage for the cartoons in each of the five clusters. The similarity or difference in meaning be- tween any two terms could be assessed by comparing their percentage profiles across the five clusters. This permitted a comparison of the meaning of the terms across languages and cultures.\nTo examine similarities and differences in their meanings, MDS was first conducted on all 67 terms for the 14-year-olds. The specifications for the analy- sis were identical to those applied in the earlier MDS analyses, except that in this case, a distance matrix was computed between terms instead of between car- toons as was done in the earlier analyses. Stress values for one- to four-dimensional solutions were, respectively, .34, .18, .09, and .06. This suggests that a three-dimensional solution was needed. Examining this, the first dimension opposed the aggressive and the nonaggressive terms, the second dimension op- posed the physical and social exclusion terms, and the third dimension differentiated the verbal and social exclusion terms. Because a three-dimensional solution is difficult to visualize or portray, a hierachi- cal cluster analysis was conducted to aid the identifi- cation of subgroups of terms. The specifications for the analysis were identical to those used before, with\nthe distance matrix computed between terms. Six main groups or clusters were identified (see Figure 6). The clusters can be interpreted by referring back to Table 3, where the \xe2\x80\x9cmeaning\xe2\x80\x9d of each term (with re- gard to the cartoons) can be inferred.\nThe first cluster consisted of 19 terms, which were generally higher on the physical bullying, verbal, and social exclusion clusters than on the physical ag- gression cluster; thus, these terms tended to be clos- est to the definition of bullying, and did indeed in- clude the English term bullying, as well as the term picking on.\nThe second cluster consisted of six terms, which scored most highly on the social exclusion cluster. The third cluster had seven terms; these all scored much more highly on the verbal:direct indirect cluster than on the physical bullying or social exclu- sion clusters. The English term teasing appeared in this cluster.\nThe fourth cluster had 19 terms; these were weighted most highly on the verbal:direct indirect cluster, but moderately on the physical bullying cluster, and less on the social exclusion cluster. The English terms ha- rassment, intimidation, and tormenting appeared in this cluster.\nThe fifth cluster contained three items, which were only weighted highly on physical aggression and physical bullying. The sixth cluster had 13 items, which loaded highest on either the physical aggres- sion or the physical bullying cluster, but moderately on one or two other aggressive clusters.\nCorresponding terms from different languages were not necessarily close together; thus, although different countries did contribute different numbers of terms to the analyses (range, 1\xe2\x80\x937; see Tables 2 and 3) there was no reason to suppose that this had af- fected the cluster structure obtained. For example, the four terms used in Austria all fell in different clus- ters (Table 3, Figure 6): gemein sein in the bullying cluster, sekkieren in the verbal cluster, a\xcc\x88rgern in the ver- bal   physical cluster, and angreifen in the physical only cluster.\nFigure 6 shows that the initial bifurcation of clus- ters of terms was between the \xe2\x80\x9cphysical\xe2\x80\x9d terms (Clus- ters 5 and 6) and the rest. Clusters 5 and 6 effectively included terms corresponding to violence (such as Portuguese viole\xcc\x82ncia, Italian violenza). The next split was to separate out the bullying terms (Cluster 1) from those that referred more specifically to verbal and social exclusion (Clusters 2, 3 and 4). The third split separated social exclusionary terms in Cluster 2 (such as Portuguese rejeic\xcc\xa7a\xcc\x83o) from the verbal terms (Clusters 3 and 4). The fourth split led to the six clus- ters described above.\nSmith et al. 1127\n1128 Child Development\nTable 3 Mean Percentage of 14-Year-Olds Who Included the Cartoons in Each Cluster as Part of Their Definition of that Term\n  Austria\nA1: sekkieren A2: a\xcc\x88rgern\nA3: gemein sein A4: angreifen\nChina (romanized terms) C1: lingru\nC2: qifu\nC3: qiling\nC4: qiru C5: qiwu C6: qiya C7: wuru\nEngland\nE1: bullying\nE2: harassment E3: teasing\nE4: intimidation E5: tormenting E6: picking on\nFrance\nF1: violence\nGermany\nGE1: a\xcc\x88rgern\nGE2: angreifen\nGE3: gemein sein\nGE4: schikanieren\nGreece\nG1: kano to magha G2: miono\nG3: taleporo\nIceland\nIS1: radast a\nIS2: hrekkja\nIS3: skilja ut undan IS4: strida\nIS5: taka fyrir\nIS6: einelti\nItaly\nIT1: aggressivita\xcc\x80 IT2: fare il duro IT3: prepotenza IT4: violenza\nIT5: approffitarse IT6: cattiveria IT7: scorretto\nJapan\nJ1: ijime\nJ2: ijiwaru\nJ3: iyagarase\nJ4: fuzake\nJ5: nakamahazushi\nNorway\nN1: erting N2: mobbing N3: plaging N4: krangling\nNonaggressive Physical Aggression\n16 40 21 56 23 65\n3 74\n2 28 3 13 2 25 2 22 2 23 3 17 2 24\n4 34 10 42 15 43\n7 42 14 59 8 39\n3 56\n7 85 2 89 4 28 6 20\n8 40 10 70 13 76\n3 71 9 40 1 4\n13 41 4 31 4 11\n10 91 12 68 10 71 10 93 12 48 11 75 15 85\n4 9 8 27 8 30\n27 26 4 8\n18 29 6 17 11 35 9 88\nVerbal:Direct  Physical Bullying Indirect\n51 73 60 85 78 94 83 11\n57 71 94 85 82 72 79 80 67 89 85 55 39 84\n94 91 88 84 35 83 78 82 76 84 95 96\n83 60\n61 65 91 72 85 93 58 80\n84 70 74 85 92 85\n95 42 75 88 12 27 52 90 81 73 86 81\n96 68 80 74 92 86 96 63 82 84 96 91 94 93\n50 87 56 94 56 97 38 56 29 55\n28 67 46 70 81 77 45 22\nSocial Exclusion\n34 58 90\n7\n51 68 52 53 58 60 45\n62 49 51 46 64 67\n26\n46 30 85 55\n65 78 75\n25 60 97 64 65 75\n63 72 90 59 75 86 89\n39 56 43 19 65\n36 39 58 18\n (Continued)\nSmith et al. 1129 Table 3 MCoenatninPuerdcentage of 14-Year-Olds Who Included the Cartoons in Each Cluster as Part of Their Definition of that Term\n   Portugal\nP1: abuso P2: armar-se P3: insulto P4: provoc\xcc\xa7a\xcc\x83o P5: rejeic\xcc\xa7a\xcc\x83o P6: viole\xcc\x82ncia\nSlovenia\nSL1: nadlegovanje SL2: nasilnis\xcb\x87tvo SL3: trpinc\xcb\x87enje SL4: ustrahovanje SL5: zavrac\xcb\x87anje SL6: zlorabljanje\nSpain\nS1: maltrato S2: meterse con S3: rechazo\nS4: abuso\nS5: egoismo\nThailand\nT1: nisai mai dee T2: klang\nT3: tum raai\nNonaggressive Physical Aggression\n3 10 1 18 4 35 3 60 1 8 1 18\n13 51 6 88 7 58 4 45 7 43 4 40\n8 49 15 66 6 28 5 21 6 21\n15 77 19 32 10 38\nPhysical Bullying\n71 72 17 69 38 74\n89 96 93 79 54 84\n96 63 42 86 54\n79 64 76\nVerbal:Direct  Indirect\n55 56 58 78 54 24\n67 48 75 49 66 59\n85 86 81 75 66\n81 86 61\nSocial Exclusion\n30 75 20 44 81 16\n42 33 65 31 92 49\n65 40 96 58 94\n69 67 48\n Note: The five clusters consist of the following cartoons: nonaggressive (8, 10, 16, 18), physical aggression 6, 7), verbal:direct indirect (9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 24, 25), and social exclusion (19, 20, 21, 22, 23).\n(1, 4), physical bullying (2, 3, 5,\nDISCUSSION\nThe cartoon methodology used in the present study generally proved successful; children appeared to en- joy the task and it held their attention. This was facil- itated by the narrative line used in the sequence, be- cause often one feature was changed at a time. The danger of this technique is the possibility of order ef- fects; however, these were not apparent in the results. For example, the social exclusion cartoons near the end (19\xe2\x80\x9323) were clearly treated differently than other items, including the last two (24, 25). The two pro- social cartoons (10, 18), although separated by seven other cartoons, were scored almost identically (Fig- ures 2 and 3).\nAs predicted, the results indicated that 8-year-olds had a less differentiated understanding of terms than did the 14-year-olds. Overall, the lack of differentia- tion between the cartoons for the 8-year-olds (two clusters versus five for the 14-year-olds) suggests a relatively limited ability in this younger age group to differentiate the situations presented in the cartoons, by means of the terms presented to them. The age comparison was based on the same 47 terms. How- ever, the 14-year-olds had a wider choice of terms in\nmany countries (Table 2), and although the terms shared with 8-year-olds were usually presented first, this was not invariably done; it is conceivable that the larger number of terms available to many 14-year- olds assisted their differentiation. It is also possible that younger children might have differentiated more on a free-sorting task with the cartoons, rather than a verbal labeling task, as was used in this study. How- ever, the present finding is consistent with that of Younger et al. (1985, 1986), who also used MDS tech- niques and found a progressive differentiation in 6-, 9-, and 12-year-olds\xe2\x80\x99 perceptions of classmates in terms of aggression, likeability, and withdrawal.\nThe present study\xe2\x80\x99s findings (Figures 2 and 3) sug- gest that at 8 years, children still primarily contrast aggressive and nonaggressive scenarios, but do not distinguish so clearly between different forms of ag- gression (physical aggression, physical bullying, ver- bal aggression, and social exclusion). This is in line with the finding in a study by Smith and Levan (1995) with 6-year-olds, that bullying and fighting are not clearly distinguished in young children. Figure 2 does show some separation between physical aggression and bullying (above the horizontal axis) and verbal plus social exclusionary aggression (below the hori-\n1130 Child Development\n Figure 6\nCluster analysis of 67 terms as used by 14-year-olds.\nof bullying by 8-year-olds might be due to the fact that they experience physical bullying more than the verbal or social exclusionary forms (rather than being due to cognitive limitations). However, although physical forms are more common in younger chil- dren, verbal bullying and social exclusion are cer- tainly not infrequent at this age (Genta et al., 1996; Whitney & Smith, 1993), or even younger ages (Crick et al., 1997); thus, an explanation linked to experience is considered unlikely.\nThe 14-year-olds clearly discriminated the differ- ent cartoons in more detail. It is nevertheless interest- ing that the two indirect relational cartoons (24 and 25) did not begin to form a separate cluster, but were fully integrated with the other direct verbal aggres- sion items (11\xe2\x80\x9315). It would be interesting to see if adults separate these two clusters more clearly; re- searchers (Bjo\xcc\x88rkqvist et al., 1992; Crick et al., 1997; Crick & Grotpeter, 1995, 1996) have distinguished these as two separate kinds of aggression.\nThe age differences in the present study were gen- erally found to be consistent in the different countries, when this was explored on individual country data. The lesser differentiation of terms by younger chil- dren raises important issues in the measurement of bullying (Smith & Levan, 1995). There is a possibility that the higher reported rates of victimization often found in younger children are due to a more inclusive understanding of the term bullying, which does not delineate it as only a subset of aggression. Examining this possibility in relation to the large-scale survey studies using the Olweus questionnaire, Smith, Mad- sen, and Moody (1999) concluded that the more inclu- sive understanding of bullying by younger children (up to 8 years) was probably an important factor in the high rates of bullying and victimization often re- ported by these age groups.\nThe present study also examined gender differ- ences in the clustering of terms, by running analyses (Figures 4 and 5) separately for each gender. There was little difference in the configurations of cartoons in the MDS solutions, and the cluster analysis pro- duced almost identical cluster structure at the five- solution level (with just one cartoon, 9, being in a dif- ferent cluster for boys than for girls). We concluded that there were no large gender differences in the un- derstanding of the kinds of social situations depicted in the cartoon set. This is consistent with other studies on the definition of bullying (Madsen, 1997; Smith & Levan, 1995), which suggests that although boys and girls differ in the kinds of bullying they give and re- ceive (Lagerspetz, Bjo\xcc\x88rkqvist, & Peltonen, 1988), at any particular age they share a common understand- ing of what the terms mean. Even though boys may\nzontal axis), but this separation is not as significant at 8 years as it is at 14 years. Also, the 8-year-olds did not appear to so clearly separate physical aggression and physical bullying as did the 14-year-olds (Clusters 2 and 3), nor did they so clearly separate verbal aggres- sion and social exclusion as did the 14-year-olds (Clusters 4 and 5). This lesser discrimination of types\ndirectly experience more physical bullying, and girls may experience more indirect bullying, there is con- siderable overlap. In addition, both boys and girls are likely to observe a considerable amount of bullying involving both same-sex and opposite-sex children (O\xe2\x80\x99Connell et al., 1999).\nThe cartoon methodology allowed for the ability to compare 67 terms from 14 countries, with regard to their weighting on the five major clusters obtained from Figure 3 (in a slightly modified version embod- ying 67 not 47 terms). The results (Table 3) and the cluster analysis (Figure 6) show something of the con- ceptual structure captured in different languages, and show how closely other terms relate to the term bul- lying. Naturally, the results are limited by the choice of terms used in each country, and the number of terms available. The relatively few items in the social exclusion cluster (six items) may reflect an uninten- tional lesser emphasis on these terms in the instruc- tions given to participating teams for generating terms to use. Indeed, the English data did not include such terms as social exclusion or rejection. Thus, little attention can be given to the absence of a term in the clusters in Table 3, for a particular country or lan- guage. However, it is possible to compare profiles of those terms, which are present.\nThe English term bullying loaded highly on both physical and verbal bullying, moderately highly on social exclusion, less highly on an even-handed dis- pute or a provoked retaliation, and, of course, mini- mally on nonaggression (see Table 3). This is consis- tent with the general adult understanding of the term; bullying is different from aggression, and is generally thought to be both physical and verbal, but is not al- ways thought to include more psychological forms of behavior such as social exclusion. Boulton (1997) found that less than 50% of teachers and only one in five pupils in English schools defined psychological or emotional abuse as \xe2\x80\x9cbullying.\xe2\x80\x9d\nTable 3 might be used to help choose the most suit- able term, when translating a questionnaire such as the Olweus questionnaire into another language. Even if the questionnaire gives an extended definition near the beginning, it is usual that one term is used in most of the questions (e.g., \xe2\x80\x9cHow often have you been bullied this month?\xe2\x80\x9d), and it is correspondingly likely that children may use their natural understanding of this term (\xe2\x80\x9cbullied\xe2\x80\x9d) rather more than the longer def- inition read earlier.\nHowever, the English term bullying, as used by schoolchildren, does not match perfectly with the def- initional concept used by many researchers and now widely accepted in the scientific community; this is because the term bullying, at least in England in the\nlate 1990s, still did not fully include social exclusion. Thus the Portuguese term abuso might be taken as reasonably similar in common usage to the English term bullying, being high on physical and verbal bul- lying, lower on social exclusion, and very low on fighting. However, the Portuguese term armar-se could be seen as a better correspondent to the scientific def- inition, because it is higher on social exclusion. This imperfect correspondence between popular and sci- entific definition of terms such as bullying is an issue that researchers must remain aware of.\nTable 3 may also help in the interpretation of cross- national comparisons. For example, Genta et al. (1996) compared rates of bullying (using the Olweus questionnaire) in Italy, with those in the United King- dom reported by Whitney and Smith (1993). Gener- ally high rates of bullying were found in both central and southern Italy that were notably higher than the rates reported in the United Kingdom. In the Italian questionnaire, the term prepotenza was used for bully- ing. Table 3 shows that prepotenza does indeed load highly on physical, verbal, and social exclusionary bullying, but also on fighting (Cluster 2). Thus, the higher rates may reflect a more inclusive response in- corporating even-handed fighting, as well as bullying with an imbalance of power. Using the term prepo- tenza in questionnaires in Italy may therefore lead to an overestimation, if the findings are then referred to as yielding rates of bullying. Other Italian terms such as violenza, cattiveria, or scoretto suffer a similar problem.\nAn alternative to using global terms such as bully- ing in questionnaire surveys is to ask for information on the experience of particular acts. For example, the Life in School checklist (Arora, 1994) asks children if they have experienced acts such as being hit, threat- ened, teased, or called names. This avoids issues of children\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of the term bullying. How- ever, if researchers wish to make generalizations about the occurrence of bullying, they face the prob- lem of deciding which acts should be included as bul- lying. This amounts to a decision by the researchers, not the children. In addition, such questionnaires nor- mally do not specify that there should be an imbal- ance of power in the act experienced, so straightfor- ward fighting and aggression (rather than bullying) may be included by researchers. These drawbacks mean that there is likely to continue to be a place for questionnaires about bullying (or ijime, abuso, or whatever term is used in a particular country), and it is then important to know how children understand these terms.\nResearchers who investigate the phenomenon of bullying are involved, as are adult and child members of the community, in the process of constructing its\nSmith et al. 1131\n1132 Child Development\nmeaning in a social and historical context. Histori- cally, meanings of words change. Even the core con- cept of the term bully has changed dramatically over several centuries. More subtle changes have taken place in the past 5 years, with the incorporation of more indirect and relational forms of bullying into current definitions. In addition, the term bullying is now commonly used in the workplace and is not solely confined to the school context.\nThe current study therefore represents an histori- cal snapshot of the meaning of terms cognate to bul- lying, at the turn of the second millenium. This snap- shot is moreover limited by the particular samples of terms used, and of choice of respondents, in the 14 countries selected. However, the findings should as- sist in the design and interpretation of comparative cross-national studies of bullying at the present time and for some years to come. In addition, the findings concerning the greater discrimination of criteria at 14 years than 8 years, and the lack of gender differences in understanding and use of terms despite the gender differences in behavior, may be of considerable gener- alizability over time and in different countries.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors thank Hidefumi Arimoto, Julius K.

ATLAS DEBRA J. PEPLER York University\nABSTRACT The prevalence and nature of bullying was assessed on the basis of observations of children's interactions in the classroom. This study was based on a systemic-develop- mental model of bullying and victimization. Participants were drawn from 1 public school in metropolitan Toronto. Twenty- seven children (19 boys, 8 girls) identified by teachers as aggressiveand nonaggressive were targeted for filming. The 27 children were identified from the total number of students (A' = 190) in the 8 classrooms.There were 60 bullying episodes observed from 28 hr of video and remote audio recordings of classroom observations. Bullying occurred twice every hour in the classroom and was short in duration. The boys and girls bullied at the same rate. Peers were involved in some capacity (from actively participating to passively onlooking) in 85% of the bullying episodes. Results suggest that bullying unfolds in a peer context in the classroom and is related to the type of classroom activity and individual characteristics of children involved in bullying conflicts.\nBullying has recently become the focus of psychologi- cal research (Olweus, 1991, 1993; Pepler & Craig, 1995; Stephenson & Smith, 1989; Tattum, 1989; Ziegler & Pepler, 1993). Studies indicate that a large proportion of children are involved in bullying at school (Besag, 1989; Olweus, 199I , 1993; Perry, Kusel, & Perry, 1988; Tattum,\n1989; Ziegler & Pepler). Between 7% and 34% of school- aged children are involved in bullying occasionally during the school term in both the capacity of bullies and victims of bullying (Besag, 1989; Olweus, 1987; Perry et al.; Roland, 1989b; Stephenson & Smith; Yates & Smith, 1989; Ziegler & Pepler). The results of survey data indicate that bullying is pervasive in the school milieu (Olweus, I99 I ; Perry et al.; Stephenson & Smith; Ziegler & Pepler). To date, much of the research on bullying has relied on self- report data, teacher report data, and peer nominations, which may be of limited value in assessing situational vari- ables that influence bullying (Olweus, 1978, 1991; Perry et al.; Roland, 1989; Stephenson & Smith).\nIn contrast, we used naturalistic observations of bullying in the classroom with video cameras and remote micro- phones (Pepler & Craig, 1995). Observations in the present study comprised naturally occurring bullying interactions in\nthe classroom. Our research makes a unique contribution by assessing the prevalence and the nature of naturally occur- ring bullying interactions in the classroom.\nIn this study, we adopted a systemic-developmental model of bullying and victimization. A systemic-develop- mental framework incorporates the assessment of a wide array of factors that may contribute to the development of aggressive behavior: individual factors, interindividual interaction, social relations, and cultural and ecological conditions (Cairns & Cairns, I99 I ) . This theoretical per- spective requires an integration of individual difference, social-interactional, and ecological perspectives. Bullying behavior is an interaction that occurs between an individual bully and victim and unfolds within a social ecological con- text. The bullying interaction is influenced by a number of factors: (a) the individual characteristics of the bully and victim, (b) the dyadic interactional processes between the individual bully and victim, (c) the presence of peers and teachers, and (d) the context in which bullying behavior unfolds. Although individual characteristics of the child play an important role in the development of bullying behavior, both dyadic interactional processes between the individual bully and victim and the broader social context in which bullying occurs are equally important to our under- standing of bullying interactions (Cairns & Cairns; Coie & Jacobs, 1993).\nWith an increased understanding of the characteristics of bullies and victims, the nature of their interactions (dyadic features), and the social context in which bullying occurs, we are better equipped to address the problem of bullying within our schools and in the larger society (Cairns & Cairns, 1991; Coie & Jacobs, 1993). Within the context of the present study, we examined the prevalence and the nature of bullying i n relation to individual characteristics of bullies and victims (gender and aggressiveness) within bul- lying episodes in the classroom. We also studied the char- acteristics of the bully-victim dyad, specifically assessing\nAddress correspondence and requestsfor reprints to Debra J.

Finally, we examined the social ecological factors that comprised the frequency and nature of peer and teacher involvement and the structure within the classroom in which bullying interactions occurred.\nBullying is a form of aggressive behavior with an imbal- ance of power; the dominant person(s) intentionally and repeatedly causes distress by tormenting or harassing anoth- er less dominant person(s) (Besag, 1989; Olweus, 1991; Roland, 1989; Smith, 1991; Smith & Thompson, 1991; Stephenson & Smith, 1989; Tattum, 1989). This aggressive behavior can be expressed physically (e.g., kicking, hitting) or verbally (e.g., name calling); it can be direct or indirect (Olweus, 1978, 199I , 1993). Direct bullying refers to open attacks on the victim-kicking, pushing, hitting, teasing, taunting, mocking, and threatening and intimidating (Far- rington, 1993; Olweus, 1991). Indirect bullying refers to social isolation, social ostracism, exclusion, and nasty gos- sip (Olweus, 1991, 1993; Roland, 1989). Indirect bullying involves manipulating the social status of an individual within his or her peer group by changing the way others perceive and respond to that individual (Bjorkqvist, Oster- man, & Kaukianinen, 1992; Lagerspetz, Bjorkqvist, & Pel- tonen, 1988).\nThese forms of indirect or psychological bullying include telling false stories about others, saying bad things behind people\xe2\x80\x99s backs, telling others not to be someone\xe2\x80\x99s friend, and trying to persuade others to dislike a certain person (Bjorkqvist, Lagerspetz, & Kaukianinen, 1992a; Crick & Grotpeter, 1995; Lagerspetz et al., 1988). In the case of social exclusion and nasty gossip, the aggressor remains anonymous often by manipulating others to attack the vic- tim; it is unlikely that the aggressor is retaliated against (Bjorkqvist et al., 1992b).For more details on the definition of bullying and bullying behaviors, see Appendix A.\nThe first variilble that must be considered within a sys- temic-developmental framework for bullying is the individ- ual. The work of Olweus (1991), based within a personali- ty perspective, has been fundamental in identifying the characteristics of bullies and victims. Olweus (1993) described boys who bully as having an aggressive personal- ity style combined with physical strength. Male victims, on the other hand, were characterized as being physically weak and timid and having an anxious personality style (Olweus,\n1993). Gender is another individual factor that relates to bullying interactions. On self-report questionnaires, boys are more likely than girls to acknowledge that they have bullied others (e.g., Roland, 1989; Ziegler & Pepler, 1993). That finding is consistent with the traditional view that males are more aggressive than females (Maccoby & Jack- lin, 1974). Recently, researchers have questioned the strength of gender differences in aggression (e.g., Hyde, 1984). When forms of aggression, other than physical aggression are examined, gender differences are less pro- nounced (Bjorkqvist, Lagerspetz, & Kaukianinen, 1992; Bjorkqvist, Osterman, & Kaukianinen, 1992; Roland,\n1989). In playground observations of a wide range of bully- ing behaviors, boys and girls engaged in bullying at the same rate (Craig, 1993). There does not appear to be a gen- der difference in the prevalence of victimization (Ziegler & Pepler). There is. however, a gender difference with respect to the type of aggression one is exposed to: Girls are more likely to be victimized by indirect and subtle forms of bul- lying than boys are (Whitney & Smith, 1993). There is a need to expand our understanding of individual factors as they relate to bullying interactions.\nThe second variable that needs to be considered within the systemic-developmental framework is the dyadic rela- tionship between the bully and the victim. The most salient feature within this dyad is the power imbalance between the bully and the victim. Research on bullying highlights the im- portance of a power imbalance between an individual bully and victim; the bully always has more power than the victim, and the victim is unable to defend himself or herself under those circumstances (Besag, 1989; Olweus, I99 I , 1993; Roland, 1989). The presence of a power imbalance distin- guishes bullying from other forms of aggressive behavior (Olweus, 1993). Olweus (1993) purported that an interac- tion is not considered bullying when students of approxi- mately equal physical and psychological strength are fight- ing. The bully\xe2\x80\x99s power over the victim may derive from relative individual characteristics (e.g., strength, size) or from the alignment of others within the social context (e.g., peers aligning with the bully; Craig, 1993).\nThe third variable in the theoretical model comprises the social ecology of bullying. That extends the focus beyond the interaction between the bully and the victim to include other individuals ( e g , peers and teacher) and the structure of the social context in the classroom. Bullying affects the immediate players and also has consequences for peers who are either actively involved or who witness the interaction (Olweus, 1978; Tattum, 1989). Aggression usually arises within a group context and may be influenced by the group (DeRosier, Cillessen, Coie, & Dodge, 1994; Hartup, 1983). Observational research on bullying on the playground revealed that peers were present in 85% of the bullying episodes and only intervened to stop bullying in 11% of those episodes (Craig, 1993). Peers may inadvertently rein- force the behavior by not reprimanding the bully, or they may be drawn into the interaction to participate actively (Craig, 1993; Olweus, 1978; Tattum, 1989). On the play- ground, peers were actively involved in two thirds of the bullying episodes (Craig, 1993), suggesting that peers may be pressured to get involved in the interaction for fear that they too may be victimized (Tattum, 1989).Further, peers who witness bullying may experience considerable discom- fort (Ziegler & Pepler, 1993). A survey assessing the level of bullying in Toronto schools indicated that 61% of stu- dents sampled reported that witnessing bullying is unpleas- ant; approximately 33% of peers reported that they could\njoin in and bully another student (Ziegler & Pepler). Peer involvement may be a salient factor that perpetuates and\n 88\nThe Journal of Educational Research\nsustains bullying interactions whether or not peers become activeparticipants.\nFrom a social ecological perspective, the assessment of bullying must also include the role of the teacher in bullying interactions. Surveys indicate that teachers are generally unaware of bullying and may do very little to intercede (Besag, 1989; Olweus, 1991; Smith, 1991; Ziegler & Pepler, 1993).Ziegler and Pepler found that 47% of victimized pri- mary school students reported that they had told a teacher. Victims of peer abuse may not be inclined to report attacks to their teacher because they fear reprisal from their aggres- sors or they blame themselves (Smith; Besag).Twenty-eight percent of victimized primary students reported that they had not told a teacher or a parent about being victimized at school (Ziegler & Pepler). Smith referred to bullying as the \xe2\x80\x9csilent nightmare\xe2\x80\x9d because there is a code of secrecy where- by victimized students and witnesses to bullying do not report the act. Yates and Smith (1989) found that only 15 out of 51 students who had been bullied told their teachers or school counselors about the incident. Even when teachers are aware of bullying, they may do very little to intercede.\nSelf-report questionnaires revealed that approximately 40% of students in the primary grades responded that teach- ers intervene to stop bullying only \xe2\x80\x9conce in a while or almost never\xe2\x80\x9d (Olweus, 1993), suggesting that teachers may do little to intervene. Besag (1989) suggested that teachers or adults in the school community may not know how to solve the problem. Also, bullying is a covert activity that is kept from the view of adults (Smith, 1991).As a result, it is difficult for adults to achieve a comprehensive understand- ing of the factors that influence the incidence and nature of bullying behavior.\nFinally, according to the theoretical model, the structure of the social context may be critical in examining bullying. The school playground is the location where bullying is most likely to occur, followed by the classroom and hall- ways (Olweus, 1993; Stephenson & Smith, 1989; Whitney & Smith, 1993; Ziegler & Pepler, 1993). Bullying tends to take place in relatively unsupervised areas such as the play- ground; teachers and adults may have difficulty understand- ing the extent of the problem (Craig & Pepler, 1997; Olweus, 1993). Craig and Pepler\xe2\x80\x99s (1996) playground observations revealed that adults were in close proximity to only 17% of the bullying episodes. In the Toronto survey, 50% of students and 39% of teachers acknowledged that bullying occurs in the classroom (Ziegler & Pepler). In Eng- land, 30% of elementary and middle school students report- ed being bullied in the classroom (Whitney & Smith). The presence of the teacher in the classroom may do little to deter children from bullying.\nGiven that the intensity of teacher supervision may vary by the structure of the learning activity within the class- room, this ecological factor may also relate to the incidence of bullying. In the present study, classroom structure refers to the amount of teacher supervision or teacher-student interaction. Teacher-led tasks, by definition, are highly\nsupervised with a great deal of teacher-student interaction or teacher directive (Houston-Stein, Friedrick-Cofer, & Susman, 1977). In contrast, group and solitary tasks allow students to work more independently with less direct super- vision than teacher-led tasks. Children in less structured classrooms were more aggressive than those in highly struc- tured classrooms (Houston-Stein et al.). In this study, we examined three types of structure: teacher-led tasks, group tasks, and solitary tasks. The structure of the learning activ- ity in the classroom has been shown to influence children\xe2\x80\x99s behavior (Houston-Stein et al.).\nIn summary, the theoretical model suggests that a wide array of variables influence bullying behavior. To date, empirical work on bullying has relied exclusively on self-, peer-, and teacher-report methods (Olweus, 1978, 1993; Perry et al., 1988; Roland, 1989; Stephenson & Smith, 1989).There are no naturalistic observations of bullying in the classroom to verify those reports. Although the methods indicate the occurrence of bullying, they may be of limited value in assessing the confluence of individual, dyadic interactional, and social ecological factors that influence bullying interactions in the classroom. From a theoretical perspective, bullying must be studied not only as an indi- vidual characteristic but also as a dyadic interactional process that generally occurs within the context of the peer group and the broader social context in which it unfolds (Craig, 1993; Olweus, 1991, 1993). Observations of natu- rally occurring bullying interactions may provide insights beyond those of self-report, validate some aspects of self- reports, and extend o u r understanding of behavior patterns that may not be apparent through self-reports.\nIn this study, we examined bullying in the classroom by observingchildren\xe2\x80\x99sclassroom interactions.Observationsof naturally occurring bullying interactions with video cameras and remote microphones provide a research tool to gain access into a world not normally privy to adults (Pepler & Craig, 1995). That observational research permits an assess- ment of individual characteristics of bullies and victims, fea- tures of the dyadic interaction between the bully and the vic- tim, and social ecological factors such as peer and teacher involvement and the structure of the environment in which bullying behavior occurs. Our use of naturalistic observations allowed us to see bullying behavior in a natural setting (for a more detailed review of the method see Pepler & Craig); external validity for the observations is relatively high.\nOur primary objective in the present study was to exam- ine the prevalence and nature of bullying interactions in the classroom. A secondary objective of the present study was to describe the individual characteristics of children involved in bullying interactions, dyadic features of the interaction, and social ecological factors related to bullying within the classroom.\nMethod\nOur research is an extension of a naturalistic study on peer relations of aggressive and nonaggressive children\n November/Decemher 1998 [Vol. 92(No. 2)]\n89\nobserved on the playground and in the classroom. Survey and observational data were collected on teacher-identified aggressive, nonaggressive, and comparison children. The previous study focused on the frequency of prosocial and antisocial behavior patterns on the playground and in the classroom to assess the effectiveness of a social skills train- ing program (Pepler, Craig, & Roberts, 1998; Roberts, Pep- ler, & Craig, 1998). In the present study, we focused specif- ically on the nature of bullying and victimization within the classroom context. In addition, we coded bullying from the videotaped observations of children\xe2\x80\x99s interactions in the classroom.\nParticipants\nParticipants in the present study included all children who were observed in bullying interactionson 28 hr of videotape of classroom observations drawn from the previous study. Participants comprised students from one public school in metropolitan Toronto; they were from low- to middle- income families and ethnically diverse backgrounds.\nThe focal children filmed in the previous peer relations study included 17 aggressive children ( I 2 boys and 5 girls) aged 6-12 and 17 nonaggressive children who were nomi- nated by teachers and matched on age, gender, and ethnici- ty. Observations were filmed in eight classrooms-five pri- mary classrooms (Grades 1-3) and three junior classrooms (Grades 4-6). The average number of children per class- room was 24 and ranged from 17 to 32. There were 190 children (98 boys and 92 girls) in the eight classrooms in which the focal children were filmed. Each focal child was filmed in the classroom for 1 hr.\nThe sample in the present study included all focal chil- dren in the peer relations study who were observed in a bul- lying episode in the classroom. Within this sampling frame, we coded all bullying episodes in which the focal children were involved as a bully, victim, or peer actively participat- ing in the episode or passively watching it. In this study, we observed that 27 (19 boys and 8 girls) of the 34 focal chil- dren in the classroom were either bullies or victims in bul- lying interactions. We observed one additional child who was a bully-victim when a focal child was a peer participant in the bullying episode. Therefore, the sample for the pres- ent study was 28 children (20 boys and 8 girls). In this study, the opportunity sample comprised all children in the peer relations study (190) who interacted with the focal children and who were observed in bullying interactions in the classroom. but who were not identified as focal children.\nObservation Procedures, Categories, and Ratings\nThe video camera was set up overlooking the classroom and was operated by a trained video technician who was present in the classroom for all of the filming. During film- ing each focal child wore a remote microphone and a pock- et-sized wireless transmitter that hung in a pouch around his\nor her neck. The remote microphone and transmitter record- ed both the focal child\xe2\x80\x99s speech and the speech of peers in proximity to the focal child. The receiver was connected directly into the camera so that the sound images were recorded simultaneously onto the videotape (Pepler & Craig, 1995). All focal children were aware that they were being filmed. That strategy for observational research has been described as being advantageous for examining covert social interactions (Asher & Gabriel). Wireless transmis- sion permits observers to capture children\xe2\x80\x99s covert verbal and nonverbal behaviors while not being proximal to the interaction and thereby limiting participants\xe2\x80\x99 reactivity to the camera (Asher & Gabriel, 1993). The behavioral pat- terns observed with both a video camera and a remote microphone (Pepler & Craig, 1995) were similar to those observed on the playground with only a video camera (Serbin, Marchessault, McAffer, Peters, & Schwartzman,\n1993) and in the classroom (Coie & Dodge, 1988). We believe that the cost, in terms of intrusiveness, of using a remote microphone are outweighed by the benefits of acquiring a verbal record, particularly for the study of covert behaviors such as bullying.\nThe technician videotaped 28 hr of observations in the classroom-I5 hr in the winter and 13 hr in the spring. The number of hours spent filming boys (19 hr) was approxi- mately twice that for girls (9 hr), corresponding to their rep- resentation in the sample. The discrepancy in the number of hours spent filming boys and girls may be related to the cri- teria used to identify aggressive and nonaggressive children in the peer relations study. Aggressive male and female chil- dren were identified originally for a social skills training program on the basis of criteria that typify male aggressive, disruptive, and noncompliant behavior (e.g., hits and kicks other children; Bjorkqvist, Lagerspetz. & Kaukianinen,\n1992). Aggressive female behavior may differ from male aggressive behavior (Bjorkqvist et al., 1992a; Crick & Grot- peter, 1995; Lagerspetz et al., 1988).Aggressive girls in the present study may be underrepresented. In all of the classes in which observations were filmed, the teacher was female.\nThere were two phases of coding for the present study. First, bullying episodes were identified by two female observers who were blind to the group membership (aggres- sive and nonaggressive) of the children. The criteria for identification of bullying episodes included a power imbal- ance, intent to harm, and victim distress. (For more details of the identification criteria see Appendix A.) Bullying episodes were identified from the classroom observations with an interrater reliability kappa coefficient of .81. Sec- ond, bullying episodes were coded, by one male and one female observer (the first author and a researcher) to exam- ine the nature and prevalence of bullying interactions in the classroom.\nWe developed the coding scheme on the basis of the sys- temic-developmental framework. In other words, individual characteristics, features of the dyadic interactions, and the social ecological variables were all coded. (See Appendix A\n 90\nThe Journal of Educational Research\nfor definitions of coding categories.) The nature of bullying interactions was examined by coding the type of bullying (verbal and physical) and type of aggression (direct and indirect) for each bullying episode. We identified individual characteristics for all bullies and victims, including gender and aggression group. Features of the dyadic interaction focusing on the power imbalance were coded. The variables for assessing power imbalance were ratings of height and weight differential. For this study, the differential or relative height and weight were of interest, rather than actual height and weight. The ratings were based on the relative heights and weights as observed on the videotape, which could be coded reliably. (Discrete heights and weights were not included because they were unreliable.) To assess the social ecological factors that influence bullying interactions, the coders translated peer intervention, peer involvement (rang- ing from passive onlooking to active participation), and teacher presence and interventions for each bullying inter- action. The coders also assessed classroom structure, a meas- ure of the ecological factors in the classroom context. Three types of classroom activity structure were coded-teacher- led, group, and solitary tasks.\nOf the 70 bullying episodes initially identified, an addition- al pair of coders classified 68 episodes. The two episodes not identified by both groups were dropped from the analysis. Reliability assessments were conducted for 47% of the tapes. The average percentage agreements using Scott\xe2\x80\x99s (1955) cor- rection ranged from 76 to 100. This index of interrater agree- ment takes chance agreement into account when calculating percentage agreement (Scott, 1955).In the present study, all categories had a percentage agreement of 76 or above so no variables were discarded in the contextual coding.\nAfter observing each episode, the coders completed a global rating scale to assess subjective impressions of the episode. Coders assessed participants\xe2\x80\x99 reactivity to the cam- era as a potential threat to the naturalistic element of the observations. By coding the frequency with which children oriented to the camera, the coders rated reactivity of bullies, victims, peers, and adults on a 5-point scale ranging from playing up to the camera a lot to not playing up to the cam- era at all. Global ratings indicated that bullies and victims were reactive to the camera in 5% of the bullying episodes. Teachers were not judged to be reactive to the camera in any of the bullying episodes. In 2% of the episodes, peers were rated as reactive to the filming. In general, children were seldom judged to be reactive to the camera; one may assume that the observed interactions had relatively high ecological validity.\nResults\nWe organized the results according to the systemic-devel- opmental framework. Results are reported in terms of indi- vidual characteristics of bullies and victims, features of the dyadic interaction, and social ecological factors that influ- ence bullying interactions in the classroom.\nPrevalence of Bullying Interactions\nWe observed each focal child for 30 min at two intervals within 2-5 days during the winter and again in the spring. There were 68 episodes of bullying on 28 hr of videotape, for an average of 2.4 bullying episodes per hour. Eight episodes (11%) were uncodeable and therefore dropped from the analyses. An episode was considered to be uncodeable when (a) the bullying interaction was inaudible but the children were visible or (b) the bullying was audible but the children were not visible in the camera frame (e.g., behind a shelving unit or out in the hallway). Fifty-four percent of the bullying episodes were observed in the winter and 45% were observed in the spring. The respective rates were 3.6 and 3.5 bullying episodes per hour. A binomial test revealed no significant dif- ference in the frequency of bullying episodes during the win- ter and spring observations (Z = .73, p = .23). There were no seasonal effects so all results were collapsed over time.\nThe Nature of Bullying Interactions\nEach bullying episode was timed from the beginning of the bullying interaction until the bully or victim disengaged from the interaction. The mean duration of bullying epi- sodes was 26 s (SD= 35.4 s) with a range from 2 to 227 s.\nThe type of aggression (verbal, physical, or verbal and physical) was coded for each bullying episode. Verbal aggression (e.g., name-calling) was observed in 53% of the episodes, physical aggression (e.g., hitting, kicking, push- ing) was observed in 30%, and a combination of verbal and physical aggression was observed in 17% of the episodes. In the classroom, the boys and girls bullied at the same rate, .5 and .4 episodes per hour, respectively. A chi-square analysis revealed no significant gender differences with respect to the type of aggression displayed in the bullying episodes, ~ ~ (N2=,60) = .92,p = .63.\nSixty-five percent of the episodes comprised direct bully- ing (face-to-face confrontation), 30% comprised indirect bullying (manipulation of the peer group), and 5% of the episodes comprised both direct and indirect bullying. A weapon was defined as an object used for attack or in defense of an attack. In two episodes an object was observed during the bullying incident. A bully used a pen to destroy another student\xe2\x80\x99s work; in the other case, the bully hit another student. Victims were not observed using objects in defense in any of the bullying episodes.\nOverall, there was more direct than indirect physical bul- lying. Twenty-eight percent of the bullying episodes corn- prised direct physical bullying; only 2% of the bullying episodes comprised indirect physical bullying (destroying someone\xe2\x80\x99s schoolwork). In 23% of the episodes, we observed direct verbal bullying; in 28% of the bullying episodes, we observed indirect verbal bullying. A chi- square analysis revealed no association between gender and type of bullying, ~ ~ (N2=,60) = 1.4,p = SO.(Examples of bullying episodes are presented in Appendix B.)\n NovemberDecember 1998 [Vol. 92(No. 2)]\n91\nThe coders categorized gossiping and social exclusion as distinct forms of indirect bullying because they differ from other forms of overt bullying (verbal and physical) and they involve relational issues (Crick & Grotpeter, 1995).Spread- ing false rumors or telling persons not to be another child\xe2\x80\x99s friend are examples of verbal indirect gossip and social exclusion, respectively. Those forms of relational aggres- sion involve intentional manipulation of peer relationships to damage another child\xe2\x80\x99s friendships and to purposefully create feelings of insecurity (Crick & Grotpeter). Gossiping and social exclusion were coded in 22% and 13% of bully- ing episodes, respectively. In 5 of the 13 episodes that involved gossip, the coders observed a female bully; in 8 of the 13 episodes that involved gossip, the coders observed a male bully. A chi-square analysis revealed a nonsignificant relationship between gender of the bully and gossip as a meansofbullying,x2(I, N=60)=.02,p=38.In7ofthe 8 episodes that involved social exclusion, the bully was male; in 1 of the episodes that involved social exclusion, the bully was female. A chi-square test for significance was not conducted because of the low number of participants in each cell.\nIndividual Cliuructeristics of Bullies and Victims\nForty-two children were observed in bullying interac- tions as either bullies, or victims, both representing 22% of the 190 students from the eight classrooms. In the class- room, 14 children were observed bullying other children, 17 children were being victimized, and I 1 children were both bullying and being victimized. Those children were catego- rized as bully-victims because they were bullies in one interaction and victims in another interaction.\nSex cfbullies arid victims. The analysis examining the sex representation of bullies, victims, and bully-victims revealed that of the 14 bullies, 8 were male and 6 were female.Ofthe I7victims,12weremale,4werefemale,and the sex of 1 of the victims could not be determined from the videotaped observations. That information could not be pro- vided by the teacher because confidentiality was assured for all the children filmed. Nine of the 1 1 bully-victims were male and 2 were female. The representation of boys and girls coded in bullying episodes in the classroom may have been influenced by the fact that there were more boys than girls in the targeted sample. To assess gender differences in frequency of bullying and victimization, we controlled for hours of observations of boys ( 19 hr) and girls (9 hr) as a proportion of time filmed. Boys were victimized more fre- quently than girls in the classroom. Boys and girls were vic- timized at a rate of 2.1 and 1.6 episodes per hour, respec- tively. There were no differences associated with the frequency of bullying. Boys and girls were equally likely to bully at a rate of approximately two episodes per hour.\nGroup membership. In the previous study, regarding peer relations of aggressive and nonaggressive children, students were assigned to different groups on the basis of whether\nthey were identified by teachers ss being aggressive or nonaggressive. In the present study, we examined group membership (aggressive, nonaggressive, or opportunity sample) of bullies, victims, and bully-victims. Of the 14 bullies, 8 children were in the aggressive sample and 1 child was in the nonaggressive sample. The remaining 5 children observed as bullies in the classroom were in the opportuni- ty sample. Of the 17 children observed as victims, 2 were from the aggressive group, 2 were from the nonaggressive group, and 13 were from the opportunity sample. Finally, 4 of the bully-victims were from the aggressive sample, 1 bully-victim was from the nonaggressive sample, and 6 bully-victims were from the opportunity sample. The per- centages of aggressive children involved in bullying episodes are reported in Table 1.\nAggressive children were significantly more likely to be involved in bullying episodes as bullies than were nonag- gressive children in the classroom ( Z = 3.8, p < .OOl). The coders observed 12 of the 14 aggressive children bullying and 2 ( I bully-victim) of the 14 nonaggressive children bullying.\nBully-Victim Dyadic Interactional Features\nDifferential height and weight between the bully and vic- tim were coded for each episode. Those categories provid- ed an indicator of the power imbalance between the bully and the victim. The categories were not a measure of actu- al height and weight but rather a relative estimate of height and weight of individual bullies and victims on a per episode basis. Bullies were coded as being taller than vic- tims in 37% of the bullying episodes. In 18% of the episodes, bullies were coded as being the same height as victims; in 12% of the episodes, bullies were coded as being shorter than victims. In 33% of the bullying episodes the height differential could not be determined because a large proportion of bullying episodes involved indirect bullying in which the victim was not in the camera frame.\nBullies were coded as being heavier than victims in 38% Table l.-Group Membership of Bullies, Victims, and Bully-\nVictims\nGroup\nBully\nSample Agg.

In 25% of the episodes, bullies were judged to be the same weight as victims; in 9% of the episodes, bullies were coded as being lighter than victims. In 28% of the episodes, differential weight was uncodeable. For bullying episodes in which there was indirect bullying, differential weight between the bully and the victim could not be determined.\nSocial Ecological Factors in Bullying Episodes\nPeer involvement. Peers participated in a variety of roles in 85% of the bullying episodes ranging from active involvement (participating in the bullying by hitting or ver- bally abusing the victim) to passive onlooking (observing the incident). Peers were observed as actively participating in the bullying interaction in 32% of the episodes. They were observed in joint activity (playing or working with those involved in the incident) in 52% of the bullying episodes. Peers in parallel activity (playing or working in close proximity to those involved in the incident but not in the same activity) were observed in 27% of the bullying episodes. Finally, in 13% of the episodes, peers were onlook- ers to the bullying interaction. (Frequency data of the nature of peer involvement in bullying episodes are reported in Table 2.) Percentages do not equal 100% because the fre- quencies reflect roles that numerous peers could assume in bullying episodes.\nPeer intervention. Peer interventions were coded as socially appropriate or socially inappropriate. The peer\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to help the victim(s) in a prosocial manner was coded as socially appropriate (e.g., informing and involving an adult or talking directly to the bully or victim). A social- ly inappropriate intervention was coded when a peer attempted to stop the bullying by using aggressive tactics (e.g., by threatening or physically assaulting the bully). Ineffective or socially inappropriate peer interventions were\nnot coded in any of the bullying episodes. Peers were pres- ent (i.e., observed in the camera frame) in 5 1 of the 60 bul- lying episodes. In 10% of the bullying episodes, peers inter- venedtostopthebullying.Peerswerejudgedtobeawareof the bullying interaction in 43 of the episodes in which they were present in the camera frame. Peer awareness of the bullying interaction was judged on the basis of the number of episodes in which peers were present in that particular capacity. (Frequency data of peer awareness of bullying episodes are shown in Table 2.) When peer intervention was considered as a proportion of time that peers were aware of the bullying incident, they intervened 14% of the time. As expected,given the ratio of boys to girls in the targeted sam- ple, twice as many of the prosocial interveners were males as females, 67% and 33%, respectively.\nTeacher intervention. Teachers intervened in 11 (18%) bullying episodes. Often children bully when the teacher\xe2\x80\x99s back is turned or when the teacher is on the other side of the classroom. Teachers were observed in the camera frame in an additional 19 episodes; therefore, they intervened in 37% of the episodes during which they were in close proximity (i.e., observed in the camera frame).\nTeachers were observed in the camera frame in 30 of the 60 episodes. They were rated by the coders as being aware of the bullying interaction in 15 of the 30 episodes in which they were present in the camera frame. Teachers were rated as unaware of bullying in 13 of the episodes; their aware- ness of bullying could not be determined in two of the episodes. In summary, teachers were aware of bullying inci- dents approximately 50% of the time when they were in close proximity to the interaction (i.e., in the camera frame). They intervened in 11 (73%) of the 15 episodes in which they were judged to be aware of bullying interactions.\nIn the classroom, there was no overall difference in the number of bullying episodes in which teachers and peers intervened (Z = -I .3, p = .19). Of the 60 bullying episodes, teachers intervened in 11 episodes and peers intervened in 6 episodes. Our findings on the frequency of intervention as a function of how often teachers and peers were proximal to the bullying interactions showed that teachers intervened significantly more than peers did (Z = 2.7, p < .05). Peers were observed in 5 1 of the bullying episodes and intervened in 6 of them; teachers were observed in 29 of the bullying episodes and intervened in 1 1 of them.\nStructure of the classroom. One objective of this study was to describe the structure of the classroom and learning activities during which bullying occurred (e.g., teacher-led tasks, group tasks, and solitary tasks). Coders identified the type of teaching method used in the classroom when the bullying interactions occurred. A chi-square analysis of the expected frequencies of bullying based on the total time filmed in each of the categories revealed a significant asso- ciation with classroom activity, ~ ~ (N2=,60) = 199.37,p < .OO1). Sixty-five percent of bullying episodes occurred when children were involved in solitary tasks. Twenty-three percent of bullying episodes occurred when children were\nTable 2.-Nature Peer role\nActive\nof Peer Involvement in Bullying Episodes\nEpisodes\nEpisodes peer(s) aware\nn 19 19\n% 32 100 In joint activity\nn 31 29\n% 52 94 Parallel\nn 16 1\no/o 2 1 44 Onlooker\nn87\n% 13 88 Intervener\nn66 96 effective 10 100\n NovemberlDecember 1998 [Vol. 92(No. 2)]\n93\nengaged in group tasks, and 12% of episodes occurred when children were engaged in teacher-led tasks. The results suggest that children are bullying and being disrup- tive in the classroom when they are not with the teacher. Therefore, aggressive children may need consistent and per- sistent teacher supervision, support, and monitoring to remain on task and to refrain from disrupting others in the classroom.\nDiscussion\nThis research is a descriptive study of the prevalence and nature of bullying behavior in the classroom. On the basis of a systemic-developmental framework, we examined the individual characteristics of bullies and victims. dyadic interactional features, and social ecological factors related to bullying and victimization. The results of the present study indicate that (a) bullying is pervasive in the classroom, (b) teachers are generally unaware of bullying, and (c) the peer group is reluctant to intervene to stop bullying. The results of the present study are discussed in terms of the sys- temic-developmental framework and intervention approach- es for dealing with bullying problems in the school milieu.\nAccording to the systemic-developmental model, bully- ing is an interaction between an individual bully and victim that unfolds in a social context.A recognition of individual characteristics of bullies and victims is important in expanding our understanding of bullying interactions. From the individual perspective, we assessed gender differences associated with the frequency of bullying. In the classroom observations, boys and girls were equally likely to bully. That finding is contrary to research from self- and teacher reports that reveals that boys are more likely to bully than girls (Olweus, 1978, 1991, 1993;Roland, 1989;Stephenson & Smith, 1989).Inthe Toronto Board of Education survey, 23% of male students and only 8% of female students acknowledged that they had bullied other students more than once or twice per semester (Ziegler & Pepler, 1993). The finding of the present study is consistent with similar observational research of bullying on the playground where no gender differences were observed (Craig, 1993).\nIn our classroom observations, boys were observed as vic- tims more frequently than girls were. That gender difference is consistent with some research (Olweus, 1991, 1993; Rigby & Slee, 1991;Stephenson& Smith, 1989),but incon- sistent with the Toronto Board of Education survey in which equal numbers of boys and girls reported being victimized (Ziegler & Pepler, 1993).The observational data need to be interpreted with caution because the proportion of time spent filming boys was greater than that for girls and, therefore, boys may be overrepresented as both bullies and victims.\nThe second individual characteristicassessed in the pres- ent study was aggressiveness. In our classroom observa- tions, aggressiveness and bullying behavior were associat- ed-aggressive children were more likely to bully than nonaggressive children. That finding is consistent with\nother research (Olweus, 1987, 1993; Stephenson & Smith, 1989). Olweus (1978) described bullies as having an aggressive personality pattern that predisposes them to respond aggressively. By bullying, those children use their aggression to assert power and dominance. Involvement in bullying raises concerns for the long-term perspectives for bullies. Aggression and antisocial behavior is relatively sta- ble over time (Huesmann, Eron, Lefiowitz, & Walder, 1984; Loeber, 1982). Similar to other aggressive children, bullies may be at risk for school failure (Patterson, 1986; Patterson, Debaryshe, & Ramsey, 1989), maladjustment, and criminal behavior (Huesmann et al., 1984; Olweus, 1991). An examination of the continuity between adoles- cent and adult bullying revealed that bullying at age 14 pre- dicts bullying at age 32 (Famngton, 1993).Olweus (1991), in a follow-up study of school bullies, found that 60% of boys identified as bullies in Grades 6-9 had at least one criminal conviction by age 24. Thirty-five to 40% of the school-aged bullies had three or more court convictions by age 24, compared with 10% of the control children\n(Olweus, 1991).\nIn the present study, equal numbers of aggressive and\nnonaggressive children were observed as victims in the classroom. The heterogeneous group of victims is consis- tent with other studies (Olweus, 1991; Stephenson & Smith, 1989).The results of the present study highlight the differ- ent subgroups of victims. Stereotypically, victims are depicted as passive and weak children who acquiesce to an aggressor\xe2\x80\x99s demands and display signs of vulnerability by crying or withdrawing (Olweus, 1978; Patterson, Littman, & Bricker, 1967; Perry et a]., 1988); however, victims can also be aggressive. Olweus (1991) made a distinction between passive and provocative victims. Provocative vic- tims differ from passive victims in that they usually provoke an attack, are easily provoked, may retaliate when attacked, and often complain about being attacked (Olweus, 1993; Perry et al.; Stephenson & Smith, 1989). Perry et al. made a similar distinction between low-aggressive and high-aggres- sive victims; some highly victimized children were nominat- ed as the most aggressive children, whereas other highly vic- timized children were never nominated as behaving aggressively.\nIn the present classroom observations, 1 1 of the 17 chil- dren observed as victims were also observed as bullies. The dynamics of victimization may be very different for victims and bully-victims. The results of the present study support the current intervention strategy of identifying bullies and victims in the early school years to provide opportunities for prevention and intervention of problems associated with bullying and victimization at school (e.g., Pepler, Craig, Ziegler, & Charach, 1993; Sharp, Arora, Smith, & Whitney,\n1994).The present study indicates that some children may be at greater risk for involvement in bullying and victimiza- tion. Schools must be proactive in identifying those children and supporting their educational progress and social and emotional development. To date, a number of question-\n 94\nThe Journal of Educational Research\nnaires have been designed that are useful for the identifica- tion of children at risk for bullying and victimization (e.g., Garrity, Jens, Porter, Sager, & Short-Camilli, 1994; Olweus,\n1989; Pepler et al., 1993; Sharp et al., 1994).\nThe second variable within the systemic-developmental model that must be considered is the dyadic interactional\nfeatures that influence bullying interactions. Assessment of the dyadic interactional features of bullying revealed the expected power differential. When it was possible to code differential height and weight, bullies in the classroom were often rated as taller and heavier than their victims, which is consistent with research indicating that bullies are physical- ly strong (i.e., big), whereas victims are physically weak and thin (Olweus, 1991; Stephenson & Smith, 1989). Those findings support the notion of a power imbalance between the bully and the victim. The results should be interpreted cautiously given that a large proportion of episodes involved indirect bullying in which the victim was not in the camera frame and thereby height and weight differential could not be determined. It is important to realize that the power imbalance in bullying may not be limited to physical size. It may be manifested in the tone of voice, physical stance of the bully, or the number of children engaged as bullies. In addition, the power differential may derive from the support of peers who are involved in the majority of epi- sodes in the classroom. Although it is often difficult for teachers to recognize those involved in bullying (given the covertness of the behavior), the results of the present study suggest that adults may play an important role by shifting the power away from the bully and supporting the victim. It is important to recognize that victimized children cannot solve bullying conflicts alone. Children who are victimized have trouble defending themselves (Olweus, 1991, 1993; Besag, 1989) and need adults to intervene. By intervening in bullying conflicts, adults shift the power away from the bully.\nThe systemic-developmental model points to the impor- tance of children\xe2\x80\x99s interactions with others. Peer and teacher involvement in bullying interactions highlight the social ecological factors that influence bullying behavior at school. In the present study, we examined the role of peers and teachers in bullying episodes in the classroom. Peers, in the classroom context, were present in the majority of bul- lying episodes. Peer group processes play an important role in supporting bullying behavior in the classroom. Olweus ( 1993) highlighted four processes that may influence peers\xe2\x80\x99 behavior in bullying interactions: modeling and reinforce- ment, social contagion, diffusion of responsibility, and social reputation of bullies and victims. Bullying interac- tions are not only influenced by the peer context, but bully- ing also has consequences for the peer group (Olweus,\n1993;Tattum, 1989;Ziegler & Pepler, 1993).It is important to consider the consequences that witnessing bullying has for peers in the classroom. Peers who witness bullying con- flicts may also be at risk because watching aggressive con- flicts may lead to discomfort and anxiety (El-Sheik, Cum- mings, & Goetch, 1989; Tattum, 1989; Ziegler & Pepler).\nFurther, peers may be drawn into the interaction for fear of being the next victim (Olweus, 1978, 1993; Tattum, 1989). Researchers should examine peer group dynamics and processes in reinforcing and maintaining bullying and the consequences that bullying has on the social and academic development of peers in the classroom.\nIn the present study, peers often were present during bul- lying episodes, but they rarely intervened to stop the bully- ing. Lack of peer intervention in bullying episodes may reflect peers\xe2\x80\x99 absence of strategies rather than an attitude of apathy. Children may not intervene to stop bullying because they are unsure how to help. In the Toronto survey, 33% of the students reported that they did nothing, but thought they should do something (Pepler et al., 1994; Ziegler & Pepler, 1993). Alternatively, peers may be staying on task in the classroom and therefore refraining from intervening in bul- lying episodes. Also, children may hesitate to report bully- ing if they are not confident about gaining teacher support (Besag, 1989). Nineteen percent of students in the Toronto survey indicated that teachers \xe2\x80\x9calmost never intervened,\xe2\x80\x9d whereas less than half of the victims of bullying indicated that they had told a teacher about the incident (Ziegler & Pepler). Many current interventions emphasize that students need to feel that it is safe to tell teachers and be assured that teachers will follow up the report and intervene (Craig & Pepler, 1996; Olweus, 1993; Sharp & Smith, 1993).\nOn the basis of a systemic-developmental model, teach- ers may play a role in the nature and prevalence of bullying interactions in the classroom. In the present study, teachers intervened in I I (18%) of the 60 bullying episodes in the classroom. When teachers were judged to be aware of bul- lying, they were more likely to intervene in bullying episodes. Nevertheless, teachers did not consistently inter- vene in bullying episodes during the classroom observa- tions. The results suggest that when teachers are aware of bullying in the classroom they tend to intervene, but often they are not aware of the covert activity. Teachers\xe2\x80\x99 lack of awareness is consistent with survey data in which there is a discrepancy between teacher and student reports. In the Toronto survey, 7 I % of teachers and only 25% of students indicated that teachers almost always intervened to stop bullying (Ziegler & Pepler, 1993).That discrepancy reflects the fact that peers are present (actively participating or pas- sively watching) during the majority of bullying episodes, whereas teachers are in close proximity in only a small number of bullying episodes. Teachers\xe2\x80\x99 lack of awareness reflects the covert nature of bullying behavior: Students bully when teachers are not there to see it. Teachers need to develop an awareness of the complexity of the problem in order to identify bullying in their classrooms. This enables them to be more vigilant and responsive to bullying prob- lems which, in turn, may give children more confidence to seek teachers\xe2\x80\x99 assistance when bullying occurs.\nAlthough peers were more frequently involved in bullying episodes than teachers were, only a small number of peers who witnessed the interaction intervened on the victim\xe2\x80\x99s\n NovembedDecember 1998 [Vol. 92(No. 2)]\n95\nbehalf. Peers intervened less frequently than teachers did. Teachers may be more inclined to intervene because they per- ceive classroom management as their responsibility. Peers do not seem to be inclined to help when another peer is being taunted in the classroom. The present study suggests that in addition to being part of the problem, peers are also part of the solution. From a systemic-developmental perspective, intervention approaches must also incorporate peers.\nFindings from the present study indicate that peers are often aware of bullying, provide an audience for it, but do not intervene. Therefore, interventions to reduce bullying prob- lems should not be limited to children who are at high risk for involvement in bullying problems, but should comprise a preventive agenda aimed at all students. A component of the intervention must be aimed at peers in several ways. First, schools must strive to increase children\xe2\x80\x99s sensitivity to vic- timized children and cultivate an ethos of peer support. Rigby andSlee(199I)examinedtheattitudesamongAustralianstu- dents toward victimized children. The majority of children were supportive of victims, but there was a developmental trend whereby sympathy for the victims decreased with age (Rigby & Slee). That trend suggests that an early intervention aimed at developing student attitudes against bullying and against viewing the victim negatively may be an effective approach to the prevention of bullying in schools. Through classroom activities such as role play, story telling, and drama, students may develop an awareness of the perspective of the victim (Cowie & Sharp, 1994; Pepler, Craig, & Ziegler et al., 1993). When students begin to experience the role of victim, they may begin to empathize and support the victims (Pepler,Craig,&Ziegleretal., 1993).\nThe second approach for intervention with peers involves lessons on the definition of bullying, providing strategies, and a language or script for intervening. Providing children with a language to stop bullying empowers children to use their voices and to take action against bullying. Within the Norwegian intervention, Olweus (199 1) outlined three class rules against bullying for peers to follow: \xe2\x80\x9cWe shall not bully other students, we shall try to help students who are being bullied, and we shall make a point to include students who become easily left out\xe2\x80\x9d (p. 445). (In Norway, a nationwide intervention program to reduce bullying incidents in schools included student lessons on the definition of bully- ing behavior.) Pepler et al. (1993) suggested that peers should be made aware of how they may inadvertently sup- port bullying by joining in or by not intervening to stop bul- lying. With an increased understanding of how peers are part of the problem of bullying, they may be likely to inter- vene (Pepler, Craig, & Ziegler et al., 1993).\nOn the basis of the systemic-developmental model, we examined the structure of the classroom, the context in which bullying unfolds. Examination of the social context in which bullying occurs highlights the role of ecological factors in bullying interactions. In the classroom observa- tions, bullying most frequently occurred when children were involved in solitary activities. As expected, bullying\nwas less likely to take place in front of the teacher. The structure of the classroom has been shown to influence chil- dren\xe2\x80\x99s behavior (Housten-Stein et al., 1977). Classroom observations of a Head Start program revealed that children in less structured classrooms (i.e., less student-teacher interaction or less teacher directive) tend to be more aggres- sive than children in highly structured classrooms (Housten-Stein et al.). The classroom context interacts with individual child characteristics. Some children may be more likely to engage in off-task and disruptive behavior than other children when not directly supervised by the teacher (Coie & Dodge, 1988). In the classroom, aggressive chil- dren may need considerable teacher support to remain on task and to learn. Aggressive children have been observed engaging in more off-task behavior and requiring more teacher attention than nonaggressive children (Roberts, Pepler, & Craig, 1998). Bullying interactions may interfere with learning for bullies, victims, and peers. The bully is off task and disruptive, and, therefore, not available for the task of learning. As a result, bullies may not develop adequate academic skills and may experience academic failure (Pat- terson, 1986). The victim may be anxious and fearful, there- by unable to attend to academic tasks. In the present study, aggressive children were more likely to bully than nonag- gressive children. Also, bullying was likely to occur when aggressive children were not interacting with the teacher or under close supervision.\nAggressive children may not possess the academic or attentional skills to apply themselves successfully to work and learn independently in the classroom (Patterson et al.,\n1989). Those children are likely to engage in bullying, which may interfere with their academic progress and that of their peers. The results of the present study suggest that classroom structure (teacher-direction) may play an impor- tant role in providing opportunity for individual children to engage in bullying behavior. That finding has implications for classroom and lesson planning. Other classroom factors, not assessed in this study, may influence bullying behavior in that context (e.g., teacher philosophy, multiage class- rooms). Mooij ( 1993) suggested that differential classroom instructional processes may increase the likelihood of bul- lying interactions in the classroom setting. Students tend to be influenced by teachers\xe2\x80\x99 instructional and management strategies (Mooij). Future research assessing bullying beha- vior in different classroom settings may provide additional insight into the nature of bullying in that context.\nTo summarize, our observations of bullying interactions in the classroom highlight the challenges for school staff to identify and respond to bullying. We recognize the difficul- ty for teachers to monitor a large group of students; more- over, there are also certain features of bullying that make it difficult to identify. First, bullying episodes in the class- room are brief. Second, bullying is most likely to occur when students are involved in solitary tasks, not directly in front of the teacher during teacher-led tasks. Third, teachers may not be aware of bullying conflicts because of children\xe2\x80\x99s\n 96\nThe Journal of Educational Research\n(victims and witnesses) reluctance to report incidents to teachers (Smith, 1991;Yates & Smith, 1989).Finally, in this study, the majority of bullying in the classroom was verbal. Because verbal bullying can be done quietly and covertly, children are able to avoid detection and punishment.\nBullying is usually associated with direct and physical attacks (Craig, 1993; Olweus, 1991); however, the findings of this observational study suggest that in the classroom verbal displays of bullying are more common than physical displays. The covert nature of bullying compounds teach- ers\xe2\x80\x99 difficulty to detect bullying. Teachers are unlikely to hear whispered attacks, threats, or harassment even when the noise level of the classroom is held to a minimum. In our study, classroom bullying involved both direct verbal attacks and indirect gossip and exclusion. That is consistent with children\xe2\x80\x99s reports of being victims of gossip in junior and secondary schools (Whitney & Smith, 1993). The use of remote microphones in this study allowed us to observe some gossip and social exclusionary behaviors both at their inception and after the effect was recognized. Teachers are often not afforded this opportunity. In the present study, however, that type of bullying may have been underrepre- sented because the instigator may have remained anony- mous from the researcher as well. The challenges of detect- ing bullying in the classroom suggest that raising teachers\xe2\x80\x99 awareness about bullying may be important to increase the frequency of teacher intervention in bullying interactions. Raising teacher awareness, however, is only part of the solution to reducing bullying problems. Findings from the present study indicate that bullying problems in schools are determined by multiple factors: individual differences, dyadic features of the interaction between the bully and the victim, and social ecological variables. Therefore, schools must adopt a systemic perspective for prevention and inter- vention of bullying problems.\nResearch indicates that a systemic approach to interven- tion in bullying is effective in reducing bullying (e.g., Olweus, 1991; Pepler et al., 1994). A comprehensive sys- temic approach to intervention in bullying should be direct- ed at the community and family, school, classroom, teacher, and student (Mooij, 1993; Sharp & Smith, 1993; Pepler, Craig, & Ziegler et al., 1993;Tattum, 1993).Olweus (1991) reported a 50% reduction in bullying in Norwegian schools over 2 years as a result of a nationwide intervention pro- gram. Within the Toronto intervention project, children\xe2\x80\x99s reports of being bullied were reduced up to 50% over 2 years (Pepler & Atlas, 1996). In addition, at one school in which a systemic approach was implemented, there was a 50% reduction in the observed frequency of aggression on the playground and in the classroom after a 30-month peri- od (Pepler & Atlas). In the present study, we highlight the importance of a systemic approach for intervention in bul- lying problems by outlining a number of different variables that influence bullying behavior in the classroom.\nUsing our research, we believe that bullying in schools represents part of the larger problem of violence in our soci-\nety. The pervasiveness of bullying in schools may reflect the institutionalizationof bullying behavior (Askew, 1989).On the basis of research in boys\xe2\x80\x99 schools, Askew suggested that values of a school often reflect the values of the larger soci- ety, which in some schools may support traditional stereo- types of masculinity and competitiveness. Reducing vio- lence in schools requires a whole curriculum approach in which students are encouraged to work together coopera- tively and to solve conflicts constructively (Cowie & Sharp, 1994). Deutsch (1993) outlined a curriculum program for educating children based on a philosophy that facilitates cooperative, interdependent learning and constructive con- flict resolution. Herbert ( 1993) purported that the combina- tion of a cognitive and affective curriculum is of critical importance in providing a safe environment in which stu- dents can learn. The primary aim of an affective curriculum is to foster the social and personal development of individual students (Herbert). An affective or antibullying curriculum can change students\xe2\x80\x99 attitude about bullying and increase helping and empathic behavior (Pepler, Craig, & Ziegler et al., 1993). That can be achieved through drama activities and role play aimed at introducing a language for interven- tion, raising empathy, and increasing sensitivity toward vic- timized children (Pepler, Craig, & Ziegler et al., 1993).\nThe present study must be considered in the context of its limitations. First, a small sample was used in this study. Second, participants were observed only in the classroom of one school, which limits generalizability because school climate or classroom climate may be related to bullying problems (Stephenson & Smith, 1989). For example, schools that have a clear policy against bullying appear to have a lower incidence of bullying problems (Stephenson & Smith). School climate data were not available; therefore, the extent to which school climate influenced bullying problems in the present study could not be addressed.\nTo conclude, the present study comprises a preliminary investigation of bullying in the classroom with a method that provides access to a world usually not privy to adults. Observations of naturally occurring bullying interactions are an effective method for investigating and understanding bullying in the classroom. Future research should incorpo- rate the use of naturalistic observations and self- and teacher reports to gain a broader understanding of the phe- nomenon of bullying. A comprehensive account of the dynamics of bullying interactions and ecological variables related to bullying can strengthen the efforts to reduce such problems. One must recognize the seriousness of bullying in the school milieu because children who are involved in bullying conflicts may be at risk for future maladjustment. Providing a safe environment will cultivate a positive atmosphere for learning and set the stage for encouraging and fostering further development.\nNOTES\nThis research was supported by a grant from the Ontario Mental Health Foundation.\n November/December 1998 [Vol. 92(No. 2)]\n97\nWe thank the City of York School Board and the teachers and children who participated in this research.

Orbit, 24. 29-3 1.\nCoding Definitions\n\xe2\x80\x9cA person is being bullied when he or she is exposed, repeatedly and over time, to negative actions on the part of one or more persons.\xe2\x80\x9d (Olweus, 1991. p. 41 1)\nIt is not within the parameters of the present study to examine the repeat- ed nature of bullying behavior.\nBullying is defined as a form of social interaction in which there is an implied imbalance of power or strength in the interaction. Bullies are always more powerful than victims. The victim has difficulty defending himself or herself against the person(s) who is harassing. This power imbalance may be demonstrated through physical size, physical stance, tone of voice, or the number of children. In some cases, more than one child may bully another child.\nNegative actions refer to behavior that is intended to inflict harm, injury, pain, or discomfort upon another individual. Negative actions can have both a physical and verbal component and can manifest itself in physical attacks or verbal contact or gesture (i.e., making faces or rude gestures).\nNegative intent is difficult to quantify because we cannot see what one is thinking. However, negative intent may be exhibited through facial expression of verbalizations of intent.\nType of bullying: Direct and indirect. Direct bullying involves open attacks on the victim and may be either verbal or physical. Indirect bul- lying is less visible and more subtle than direct bullying. It is also nega- tive actions in an asymmetrical power relationship but takes the form of social isolation, exclusion, and ostracism from a group. Another form of indirect bullying is aggression directed toward a victim who is not pres- ent. An example is gossip.\nType of aggression: Physical and verbal. Physical aggression involves hitting, kicking, spitting on, pushing or shoving, and threatening ges- tures. Verbal attacks refer to teasing, name calling, taunting, and gossip.\nBully: The person(s) who initiates the aggressive action. The bullying interaction is not one of mutuality. The aggressive behavior is not invited by both parties involved in the interaction.\nVictim: The person(s) who is subjected to the aggressive actions (physi- cal or verbal) of another more dominant individual. A more dominant individual is defined by the power differential that is determined by such things as differential size, tone of voice, stance, or demeanour.\nPeer active involvement:Children who join in the episode physically or verbally abusing the victim. Examples include hitting victim, laughing at bully\xe2\x80\x99s actions, and verbal insults. They are drawn into the episode but do not initiate the attack nor share equally in the responsibility. Examples are children who laugh while a victim is humiliated and kick a child while the bully is beating him or her up.\nPeer in joint activity: Peers who are not actively involved in the bully- ing but are involved in the episode as a result of their interaction with either the bully or the victim. An example is children playing a game with the victim when he or she is bullied. Whether aware or unaware, peers in joint activity are considered part of the episode. Indicate if the peers in joint activity are aware or unaware of the bullying episode.\nPeer onlooker: A child who is not involved in any way with bully, vic- tim, or activity. Onlookers are in close proximity and clearly watching the episode for a minimum of 5 s. They can begin to watch at any time dur- ing the episode but must sustain an interest for a minimum of 5 s.\nPeer in parallel activity: Children who are in close proximity to anoth- er child or children and engaged in similar activities. However, there is little if no active interaction between the target child and the other chil- dren around him or her.\nPeer intervener:A peer who attempts to help the victim either by phys- ically or verbally terminating the bully-victim interaction in a prosocial manner. The peer may or may not be successful in the attempt; this is documented as either effective or ineffective.\nTeacher-led activities: Situations in which the teacher uses a directive approach and plays an active role in engaging the students in constructive activities. An example of teacher-led tasks would be when the students sit in front of the teacher or when the teacher interacts with the children (indi- vidually or in a group) giving instructions about a particular activity.\nSolitary activities:Children who engage in constructive activities alone. These children work in close proximity with other children but do not engage them. This is a nondirective method in which children select activities and move freely about the classroom.\nGroup activities: Children (two or more) who are actively working together on a task. These children are interacting with each other. Group classroom tasks are categorized between the two extremes of the types of structured classrooms.\nAPPENDIX A\nDefinitions and Criteria for Coding Bullying Episodes\n Novemberrnecember 1998 [Vol. 92(No. 2)]\n99\nEpisode 1\nDuration: 227 s\nQpe of aggression: Verbal and physical Qpe of bullying: Direct and indirect Learning activity: Solitary task\nIn the following bullying episode there was I female bully, 2 female peers in parallel activity, and 1 female victim.\nThree of the 4 girls were working at a table and the fourth (the victim) joins them at the table.

These processes were examined from a social learning perspective, allowing us to consider the effects of various types of reinforcement among bullies, victims, and peers. Fifty-three segments of video tape were examined. Each segment contained a peer group (two or more peers) that viewed bullying on the school playground. Peers were coded for actively joining or passively reinforcing the bully, and for actively intervening on behalf of the victim. On average, four peers viewed the schoolyard bullying, with a range from two to 14 peers. Averaged across all episodes, peers spent 54% of their time reinforcing bullies by passively watching, 21% of their time actively modelling bullies, and 25% of their time intervening on behalf of victims. Older boys (grades 4\xc2\xb16) were more likely to actively join with the bully than were younger boys (grades 1\xc2\xb13) and older girls. Both younger and older girls were more likely to intervene on behalf of victims than were older boys. The results were interpreted as con\xc2\xaerming peers' central roles in the processes that unfold during playground bullying episodes. We discuss the results in terms of the challenges posed to peer-led interventions. Peers' anti-bullying initiatives must be reinforced by simultaneous whole-school interventions.\n5 1999 The Association for Professionals in Services for Adolescents\nIntroduction\nIn this paper we examine the potential roles that peers play in bullying on the school playground. To date, studies of children's aggressive behavior, and bullying in particular, have been limited by a focus on the individual child. Researchers have often overlooked the fact that, like other forms of aggression, bullying occurs within a social context. As Cairns and Cairns (1991) note, the social behaviors of individuals and dyads unfold in the context of larger social settings which in \xcc\x84uence the interactions among individuals. To examine the systematic processes that unfold during bullying, we investigated bullying episodes on the school playground using the peer group as the unit of analysis. An understanding of the dynamic social processes will provide direction for broad systemic interventions to address problems of bullying at school.\nIt should be noted that the observational data reported in this paper were collected from elementary school children (ranging in age from 5 to 12 years). While the majority of this age group might be considered too young for the scope of a journal dealing with adolescence, researchers have found that considerable continuity exists between aggressive behavior during childhood and adolescence (Eron, 1987; Farrington, 1993). For peers, involvement in bullying during pre-adolescence may evolve and coalesce into gang activity with aggressive peers during adolescence (Cairns et al., 1997). Thus, it makes sense to look at bullying and\nReprint requests and correspondence should be addressed to Dr D.

Craig\nrelated peer processes as possible precursors of later antisocial and problematic behavior patterns.\nBullying\nBullying is de\xc2\xaened as negative actions which may be physical or verbal, have hostile intent, are repeated over time, and involve a power differential. It may involve one or more perpetrators and recipients (Farrington, 1993). Bullying may also be indirect rather than direct, and this type of aggression often involves peers. For example, indirect bullying might involve subtle social manipulation such as gossip, spreading of rumours, and exclusion (Lagerspetz et al., 1988), or aversive levels of competition and social comparison (Besag, 1989). Power differentials in the bully\xc2\xb1victim relationship can accrue through many means\xc3\x90 one is having a group of supportive peers backing the aggressor.\nThe problem of bullying is pervasive. In a series of recent surveys of almost 5000 Canadian elementary and middle school children (aged 5 to 14), 38% reported being bullied at least ``once or twice'' during the term; and 15% reported being bullied ``more than once or twice'' during the term. The prevalence of perpetration is almost as high: 29% reported bullying others ``once or twice'' during the term and 6% reported bullying others ``more than once or twice'' during the term (O'Connell et al., 1997).\nThe problem of bullying is systemic, extending beyond the bully and victim. Like other forms of aggression, bullying unfolds in a set of social contexts: the dyad, the peer group, the playground setting, and the school environment. The focus of the present analyses is on the peer context in which bullying unfolds.\nPeer context and bullying\nWhen asked about bullying and victimization, children's responses are somewhat ambiguous. On one hand, children seem concerned about bullying: 83% of Canadian children aged 5 to 14 stated that bullying made them feel either ``a bit'' or ``quite'' unpleasant; 41% indicated that they ``try to help'' the victim when they observe bullying; and 11% indicated that other peers ``almost always'' tried to stop bullying when they saw it. On the other hand, 31% of students admitted that they ``could join in bullying someone they don't like''. With age, children were less likely to say they would offer support for victims (O'Connell et al., 1997).\nRigby and Slee (1992) reported similar \xc2\xaendings from their survey of 685 Australian children. Although the majority of children of all ages reported support for victims, this support was signi\xc2\xaecantly greater from children under the age of 12 than from older children. There was a substantial minority of children who had little or no sympathy for victims (19% of boys, 14% of girls). Factor analysis revealed that those who were not supportive of victims tended to reject weakness in children, and to enjoy the spectacle of bullying. In contrast, a third factor comprised items indicating the desire to support victims.\nThus, children's reports re \xcc\x84ect an awareness of bullying episodes and a stated interest in helping victims, however, reported levels of pro-social intervention seem to overestimate actual behavior. Craig and Pepler (1997) examined coded playground observations and found that peers were involved, in some capacity, in 85% of bullying episodes. Peers intervened in 11% of bullying episodes. This relative lack of intervention by peers is likely to reinforce bullies, who may interpret peers' behaviors as condoning bullying.\nThere may be many reasons for the discrepancies between children's stated intentions and their observed behaviors. It may be that social desirability in \xcc\x84uences questionnaire responses. Children know that adults expect them to support each other; however, it may be dif\xc2\xaecult to\nPeer involvement in bullying 439\nfollow through with this intention on the school playground. Another possibility is that children would like to protect victims, but are discouraged from intervening by peer processes that tend to maintain the status quo. The social psychological research into bystander behavior might provide insight regarding children's inaction when faced with playground bullying. One factor related to inaction of a bystander is diffusion of responsibility, \xc2\xaerst identi\xc2\xaeed by Darley and LatanA\xcc\x82e (1968). The experiments by Darley and his colleagues (Darley and LatanA\xcc\x82e 1968; LatanA\xcc\x82e and Darley, 1968; Darley et al., 1973) demonstrated that participants were less willing to become involved in seemingly dangerous situations if they were led to believe that many peers were participating in the experiment. They were also less likely to become involved if other observers (confederates) behaved nonchalantly. In the former case, responsibility was thought to be diffused among each observer to the point of individual inaction. In the latter case, the ambiguous nature of the emergency raised the participants' concerns about disapproval for reacting inappropriately to the situation.\nThese experiments were designed to elicit pro-social behavior, and might be viewed as analogous to the problem of bullying in a playground setting. In playground bullying, peers are frequently present and may diffuse responsibility, thereby reducing the impetus to intervene.\nThe power differential that bullies enjoy, coupled with peers' concerns for self- preservation, may also limit pro-social interventions. When children intervene they risk becoming the next victims. Thus, members of the peer group might acquiesce to bullying out of concerns for their own safety. A \xc2\xaenal possibility is that children lack a clear understanding of the process of bullying and a set of effective strategies to counteract bullying.\nTheoretical perspective\nWithin the present study, the peer processes that surround bullying episodes were examined from a social learning perspective of modeling and reinforcement. Bandura (1977) identi\xc2\xaeed three conditions that in \xcc\x84uence the likelihood of modeling. Children are more likely to imitate a model when: the model is a powerful \xc2\xaegure; the model is rewarded rather than punished for the behavior; and the model shares similar characteristics with the child. In the case of bullying, these conditions are often present. Peers who are present during a bullying episode have the opportunity to observe a powerful \xc2\xaegure (the bully). Our observations indicate that bullies are seldom punished for their aggressive behavior: peers and teachers were observed intervening in only 11% and 4% of episodes, respectively (Craig and Pepler, 1997). Given these conditions, bullies may in \xcc\x84uence peers to become involved in bullying as active participants.\nIn the context of bullying, reinforcement can be provided in several directions. For the present paper, we are interested in the reinforcement provided by peers to the bully, and the support provided by peers to the victim. Patterson et al. (1967), using naturalistic observations of children's play, highlighted social learning processes during aggressive exchanges. They described the nursery school as a training ground for aggression. The school playground may also be a context in which children are trained by their peers to become bullies. Peers may actively or passively reinforce the aggressive behaviors of bullies through their attention and engagement. In contrast, peers may also shape the behaviors of victims either by intervening in or ignoring the bullying behaviors.\nIn summary, the social learning processes of modeling and reinforcement may operate to shape bullying on the school playground. In the following sections, we consider the research related to these social learning processes in bullying from the perspective of the in \xcc\x84uence of\n440 P. O'Connell, D. Pepler and W. Craig\nthe bully on peers, the peers on the bully, and the peers on the victim. For this paper, we are speci\xc2\xaecally interested in how peer behaviors may in \xcc\x84uence the persistence or desistance of bullying behaviors.\nModelling: the in \xcc\x84uence of the bully on peers\nThere are several ways in which bullies may in \xcc\x84uence the behaviors of peers. First, by engaging in aggressive behaviors, bullies may attract the attention of peers who come to observe the bullying interaction. In our earlier research, we observed peers to be present in 85% of bullying episodes on the school playground (Craig and Pepler, 1997).\nBullies who are ``successful'' (i.e. are not negatively sanctioned for their actions) model for peers that aggression can be performed without fear of consequences. Bystanding peers may be more likely to act out these impulses after viewing a successful act of a aggression by a powerful peer (i.e. the playground bully). Evidence for peer modeling on the playground comes from our earlier observations in which peers were actively involved in bullying in 48% of the episodes (Craig and Pepler, 1995).\nAnother effect of repeated exposure to aggressive interactions on peers is desensitization to the negative aspects of this form of aggression. Although there is no research speci\xc2\xaecally examining desensitization to bullying, research on exposure to television violence in a laboratory context indicates that young adults become less aroused by subsequent scenes of real-life violence (Thomas, 1977). Corroborating evidence for desensitization related to repeated exposure to bullying comes from the work of Rigby and Slee (1992) who found that with age, children become less concerned and empathic for victims of bullying. The disinhibiting effects of peers' viewing of aggression might promote imitation in which bullying spreads throughout the peer group, through a social contagion process. Klaczynski and Cummings (1989) demonstrated that elementary school-aged boys, particularly those who are prone to aggressive behavior, are more likely to act out these impulses after viewing a successful act of aggression by a powerful model. We are concerned that similar processes may occur on the school playground during bullying episodes.\nReinforcement: peer effects on bullies\nWhen bullying occurs on the school playground, peers may reinforce the bullies' aggression through their attention. Global ratings of peer behaviors indicated that peers reinforce the bullies' behaviors, in some way, in 81% of bullying episodes (Craig and Pepler, 1995). In addition, peers were coded as being more respectful and friendly to bullies than to victims. These observations suggest that peers align with and reinforce the bully. These peer behaviors may serve to prolong bullying episodes.\nIntervention: peer support for victims\nGiven the many conditions that would seem to discourage peers' engaging in pro-social behaviors, it is important to consider what conditions might encourage peers to intervene on behalf of victims. One possibility is that children with high social standing might be relatively immune from the peer pressures that maintain the bully's power differential and dominance. Ginsburg and Miller (1981) examined third-child intervention into playground \xc2\xaeghting by dyads of 8- to 11-year-old boys, using hidden video-recording equipment. Only a relatively small number of boys were interveners; these children held positions of high peer group social status, as rated by naive observers during non-con \xcc\x84ict portions of the video tapes. Salmivalli\nPeer involvement in bullying 441\net al. (1996) report similar \xc2\xaendings from their recent questionnaire data obtained from Finnish sixth grade students. Children who had high sociometric status in their classroom (i.e. were group leaders, or were relatively popular with classmates) were more likely to report that they would intervene to help a victim of bullying behavior. Taken together, these \xc2\xaendings suggest that social roles are well established on the school playground, and that only peers with higher than average social status may have enough in \xcc\x84uence to successfully intervene on behalf of victims.\nThus, social roles play an important role in in \xcc\x84uencing the balance of power on the school playground. One socially in \xcc\x84uential child might singlehandedly shift a power differential by siding with a victim. Another possibility, however, is that several peers might collectively have enough social in \xcc\x84uence to shift the power differential in favor of the victim, and away from the bully.\nIn summary, the critical social learning processes that are likely to occur during bullying episodes involve peer modeling of the bully's aggression, social reinforcement of the bully by peers, and, likely less frequently, peer interventions to support the victim.\nGender and peer responses to bullying\nTo date, the majority of research into children's aggressive behavior has focused on boys (Bjoerkqvist and Niemelae, 1992). Boys tend to have extensive, relatively unintimate playgroups, therefore the con \xcc\x84ictual behavior of boys is more likely to involve salient behaviors such as direct physical aggression, yelling, and assertions of status and dominance. In contrast, girls' playgroups tend to be more intimate (Maccoby and Jacklin, 1974). Girls may, therefore, be more likely to use indirect aggression\xc3\x90hostile acts where the perpetrator remains anonymous (Lagerspetz et al., 1988). Crick and Grotpeter (1995) found that this type of relational aggression is signi\xc2\xaecantly more likely to occur among girls, while direct physical and verbal aggression are more likely among boys.\nAge and peer responses to bullying\nThe propensity to use various types of aggression varies not only by gender but also by age. Bjoerkqvist et al. (1992) suggest that physical, verbal, and indirect relational aggression are developmental phases that partly follow and partly overlap each other. Similarly, Boulton (1993) traces a developmental progression from overt to more covert forms of playground aggression.\nGender and age differences in peer responding to playground bullying were examined in the present study.\nObjectives\nIn the present study, peer involvement in bullying was examined using a samples of naturalistic video-taped playground data (Pepler and Craig, 1995). The peer processes that were examined included: the bully's in \xcc\x84uence on the peer group as assessed through modeling, peer reinforcement of bullying, and the extent of peer support for the victim through pro-social interventions. Speci\xc2\xaec questions were as follows. (1) What percentage of the video-taped bullying interactions occur in the context of a peer group (de\xc2\xaened as two or more peers who ``onlook'' for \xc2\xaeve or more seconds)? (2) To what extent do peers model the bully's behaviors by actively joining the bully in abusing the victim? (3) To what extent do\n442 P. O'Connell, D. Pepler and W. Craig\npeers passively watch the bullying episode? And (4) to what extent do peers behave in a way that supports the victim?\nMethod\nParticipants\nParticipants were drawn from an ongoing study of bullying and victimization at two Toronto area elementary schools. As part of the larger study, children from grades one to six (aged 5 to 12 years) provided self-report information on bullying, victimization, and school climate. Participants also completed nominations of peers. All parents gave informed consent, while children gave assent prior to their participation in the study.\nEach year, a subsample of approximately 120 children was drawn from the larger sample for the purposes of video-taping. This observation sample was strati\xc2\xaeed in order to include approximately equal numbers of boys and girls in each of four categories: bullies, victims, bully/victims, and comparison children. Categories were determined by two or more agreements on self, peer, and teacher nominations of bully/victim status (see below). Other peers who were video-taped while playing with members of the focal sample were included in the coding. Observations of the focal children and peers who may or may not have been in the focal sample provide the data for the analyses presented in this paper.\nMeasures\nThe video-taped subsample was derived from the following measures, completed by all children with consent in the participating classrooms. Children in the younger grades (grades 1\xc2\xb13) were individually administrated measures, while those in the older grades (grades 4\xc2\xb16) received classroom administration.\nSelf-nominations were derived from a Bully/Victim Questionnaire, based on Olweus (1989). Two items (``How often have you bullied in the past six weeks?'' and ``How often have you bullied in the last \xc2\xaeve days?'') were combined to determine self-nominations for bullying. Four items (``How often have you been bullied during the past six weeks?'', ``How often have you been bullied in the last \xc2\xaeve days?'', ``How often do you spend recess alone?'', and ``How often does it happen that other kids won't let you join in what they're doing?'') were combined to determine victimization status. Scores were summed and standardized within class and gender, and 0 75 or higher standard score on bullying or victimization was taken as a self-nomination. A 0 75 or higher standard score on both bullying and victimization was considered a bully/victim self-nomination.\nPeer nominations for each student were obtained through the Modi\xc2\xaeed Peer Nomination Inventory (MPNI), using a ``class play'' format (Masten et al., 1985; Perry et al., 1988). Students were asked to pretend their class was putting on a play, and to nominate classmates who could ``best play the part of'' a given behavior descriptor. The descriptor items on the MPNI contained seven aggression, seven victimization, and distractor items. Peer nominations were summed and standardized within class and gender. Children who received a 0 75 or higher standard score on bullying or victimization were considered as peer nominated for the respective category. A 0 75 or higher score on both bullying and victimization was considered a bully/victim peer nomination.\nPeer involvement in bullying 443\nTeacher nominations were assessed using a Nomination Form. Teachers were asked to nominate any children in the class who \xc2\xaetted behavior descriptors which de\xc2\xaened bullies, victims, and bully/victims.\nObservation procedure\nFocal children were asked to wear a waist pouch containing a wireless FM transmitter (for details, see Pepler and Craig, 1995). In order to decrease the salience of the transmitter, all children in the focal child's classroom were asked to wear a placebo pouch which was outwardly identical to the wireless microphone pouch. All children who wore the pouches assented to the procedure. Participants were asked to ``play as you normally do'' while wearing the pouches. Approximately 3% of the children refused to wear the pouches over the course of \xc2\xaelming.\nFilming was done by trained research assistants. Video cameras and microphone receivers were placed at strategic points on the playground which allowed for the greatest \xc2\xaelming range with minimal moving of the camera. Video-taping at each collection period took place over a 2-week period, thus allowing students time to acclimatize to the \xc2\xaelming process. Each target child was \xc2\xaelmed for a period of approximately 10 min at each observation phase during unstructured free play at recess or lunchtime.\nA total of 120 h of video and remote audio recordings of playground behavior were collected over a 3-year period, from a sample of approximately 120 children each year. These data comprise six collection periods, during the winter and spring of each of the three school years. The same children were followed over time whenever possible, however sampling with replacement was used as children became unavailable for the study (e.g. they left the school to attend junior high school, moved away, or were assigned to a classroom that was not a part of the study).\nData coding\nIn the \xc2\xaerst stage of coding, the 120 h of video tape were viewed to identify segments with aggressive behaviors. This process identi\xc2\xaeed episodes with evenly matched aggressive exchanges as well as bullying (a detailed description of the coding scheme is available in O'Connell, 1999). In the second stage, episodes with peers were identi\xc2\xaeed according to the following criteria: (1) the aggression involved a power differential, and thus quali\xc2\xaeed as bullying; (2) the bullying segments contained at least four actors (a bully, victim, and two or more peers); and (3) the taped segments were technically adequate (segments were eliminated if picture or sound quality was poor).\nThis two-stage data screening process resulted in a sample of 57 segments of playground bullying within the context of a peer group (two or more peers). These tape segments were of suf\xc2\xaeciently high quality to be analysed. Codes, their de\xc2\xaenitions, and reliability are summarized in Table 1.\nFrequency of bullying in a group context\nOur initial screening of playground aggression identi\xc2\xaeed 185 video-taped segments that contained bullying (i.e. aggression plus a power differential). Ninety-nine of the 185 bullying segments (53 5% of all bullying episodes) were included in the present research because they contained a peer group (two or more peers). Thus, at least two peers were found to be involved in slightly more than half of playground bullying episodes.\n444\nP. O'Connell, D. Pepler and W. Craig\nTable 1\nEvent code\nBully attacks\nPeer actively joins bully Peer passively joins bully\nOf the 99 video-taped playground bullying segments, 57 segments were of suf\xc2\xaeciently high quality to conduct \xc2\xaene-grained analyses. The remaining 42 segments were eliminated because of poor sound or picture quality.\nNon-independence of segments\nThe 57 segments selected for detailed analysis were examined for the identities of the bullies. We were able to identify four segments where a bully was present for a second time (i.e. four bullies who bullied in two video tape episodes each). Random selection was used to eliminate one of the two segments for each of the over-represented bullies. This resulted in a \xc2\xaenal sample of 53 segments that were used in the present analysis.\nCoding of peer behaviors\nFor analyses of the time spent by peers actively modeling or passively attending to the bully, or actively intervening on behalf of the victim, we coded the duration of these behaviors for each peer independently. These times were then expressed as a percentage of the total bullying segment length. The average of these \xc2\xaegures was calculated, across all segments combined, as a global indicator of the processes of modeling and reinforcement during peer involvement in bullying episodes. In cases where peers were present for only a portion of the entire video-tape episode, peers' activities were calculated as a proportion relative to the amount of time that they were present in the video-taped bullying segment.\nReliability\nInitial screening of the tapes, for all types of aggressive behavior, was done by two trained undergraduate researchers. One-quarter of the tapes were coded by both raters, in order to establish inter-rater agreement. Per cent agreement averaged 0 84. This \xc2\xaegure surpasses the minimum acceptable level for per cent agreement of 0 80 (Bakeman and Quera, 1995).\nStage two involved coding segments that contained bullying. Bullying was de\xc2\xaened as any instances of aggression where the aggressor, or aggressors, had a power differential over the victim or victims. Inter-rater agreement for this coding was 0 82.\nStage three involved detailed coding of those segments that contained bullying interchanges in a group context. The agreement between independent video tape raters was calculated for 23% of the data. Cohen's kappa statistic (1960)\xc3\x90a formula that corrects for chance agreement among raters\xc3\x90was used for the coding of events. Kappas, averaged across all categories and episodes, were 0 67.

This is followed by descriptive data that examine bullying and peer involvement. Finally, the analyses related to speci\xc2\xaec questions are presented.\nAlthough they were not a focus of the present study, school effects were assessed and one signi\xc2\xaecant difference is reported. In cases where there were no school differences, we collapsed over this variable.\nDescriptive statistics\nNumber of peers present. Across the 53 coded video tape segments, the average number of peers involved was four. The number of peers present ranged from two to 14. The minimum number of peers present (two) was determined by the inclusion criteria for video taped segments.\nNumber of peers present by gender. The mean number of peers present, and the gender of the peer group, was examined by categorizing each of the 53 segments as boys only, girls only, and mixed gender (de\xc2\xaened as having less than an 80% representation of one gender). A crosstabulation of these data is presented in Table 2.\nPlaygroups that were made up of girls only were smaller than both boys, and mixed playgroups (mean=2 5 peers). There were no girls' playgroups that contained both younger and older students. Boys' playgroups were slightly larger than girls' groups (mean=3 3 peers). Mixed play groups comprised the largest type of peer group (mean=5 3 peers).\nTable 2 Description of video-taped episodes* (n = 53): mean number of peers involved, by peer-group gender and grade level\n  Younger (grades 1\xc2\xb13) (n S.D.)\n3c2 (15, 1c8) 2c7 (4, 0c5) 4c4 (11, 1c5)\nGrade level Older\n(grades 4\xc2\xb16)\n3c6 (7, 2c5) 2c0 (2, 0c0) 5c3 (9, 2c8)\nMixed\n3c0 (1, \xc2\xb1) \xc3\x90\n8c3 (4, 3c9)\n7c2 (5, 4c1)\nTotal\n3c3 (23, 1c9) 2c5 (6, 0c5) 5c4 (24, 2c8)\n4c2 (53, 2c5)\n    3c6 (30, 1c7)\n4c3 (18, 2c7)\n \n446 P. O'Connell, D. Pepler and W. Craig\nDuration. The average duration of the coded episodes was 79 4 seconds, with a range from 7 seconds to 720 seconds. At school A the segments averaged 51 1 seconds (ranging from 7 to 128 seconds); at school B the segments averaged 111 1 seconds (with a range from 15 to 720 seconds). Video taped segments were signi\xc2\xaecantly longer at school B than at school A (t (51)=U2 09, pS0 05). The greater duration of bullying at school B may be related to the extreme length of one segment (720 seconds); the next longest segment was 151 seconds.\nNumber of peers present and duration. One index of peer in \xcc\x84uence on bullying is the relationship between the number of peers present and the length of the bullying episode. The overall Pearson product-moment correlation for both schools was r=0 23 (pS0 05), indicating a signi\xc2\xaecant positive relationship between number of peers present and duration of the bullying episode.\nPeers' modeling of bullying. Peers actively reinforced the bully by physically or verbally joining in the aggression for 20 7% of the time in each bullying episode.\nPeers' passive reinforcement of bullying. The amount of time peers spent in passively reinforcing the bully by watching without joining in was, on average, 53 9% of the time in each bullying segment.\nPeers' intervention for victims. Peers actively supported the victim by intervening, distracting the bully, or otherwise discouraging the aggression, for 25 4% of the time in each bullying episode.\nEffect of gender and grade level on peers' use of time. How peers spent their time during bullying episodes was further examined using three ANOVAs. Each ANOVA used school (A, B), peer gender (boy, girl), and grade level (younger, older) as independent variables, while the three dependent variables were time spent in ``modeling the bully'', ``passively reinforcing the bully'', and ``supporting the victim''. The variables ``modeling the bully'' and ``supporting the victim'' were negatively skewed and were square-root and log transformed to improve the shape of their distributions.\nThe ANOVA on modeling the bully revealed a two-way interaction for gender and grade level, F(1, 210)=6 5, pS0 02. Post-hoc analyses revealed that older boys were signi\xc2\xaecantly more likely to join with the bully than younger boys or older girls. In contrast, the analyses of variance using passive reinforcement of the bully as the dependent variable was non- signi\xc2\xaecant. There were no discernible differences based on school, peer gender, or grade level. Finally, the ANOVA on time spent in supporting the victim revealed a two-way interaction for gender and grade level, F(1, 210)=4 7, pS0 04. Post-hoc analyses revealed that both younger and older girls were signi\xc2\xaecantly more likely to support the victim than older boys. These data are shown in Figure 1.\nDiscussion\nThe present study con\xc2\xaerms peers' central roles in the processes that unfold during playground bullying episodes. Peer presence is positively related to the persistence of bullying episodes, and peers are most likely to behave in ways that reinforce bullying behaviors. Our\nPeer involvement in bullying 447\n Figure 1. Peer time spent in joining bully (   ) and supporting the victim (   ), by grade level and gender.\nanalyses allowed us to consider the various directions of in \xcc\x84uence present during bullying episodes. These processes are considered below, with implications for intervention.\nThe in \xcc\x84uence of the bully on peers\nBullies had a direct effect on peers: peers spent more than one-\xc2\xaefth of their time (21%) in actively joining with the bully to abuse the victim. This relatively high frequency of actively reinforcing the bully can be understood if we acknowledge that the playground context is ripe for modeling (Bandura, 1977): the bully is powerful, teachers and peers seldom intervene, and peers can share in the bully's status and power by becoming accomplices.\nOur data highlight the ambivalence that peers may have towards bullying. Recall that 83% of children in our surveys stated that bullying made them feel either ``a bit'' or ``quite'' unpleasant, while 31% of students admitted that they ``could join in bullying someone they don't like'' (O'Connell et al., 1977). Our \xc2\xaendings are congruent with those of Salmivalli et al. (1996), who found that sixth grade children underestimated their own participation in active bullying relative to peers' estimates of their behaviors.\nIn the current research, older boys spent signi\xc2\xaecantly more time in joining with the bully. This \xc2\xaending corresponds with those of Rigby and Slee (1992) who found signi\xc2\xaecantly less support for victims from older children in their study.\nIn summary, playground bullying behaviors appear to have a high potential for drawing peers into actively assisting the bully.\nWhile anti-bullying interventions need to set clear consequences for those who bully, we believe that attention on only the individual bully is inadequate. Based on the potential in \xcc\x84uence that the bully has on peers, a larger goal of intervention is to reduce the bully's in \xcc\x84uence on the audience and help peers perceive the inappropriateness of aggression.\nOne intervention that could help to decrease peers' modeling of bullying is to sensitize children to the group processes that operate during playground bullying. Bullying can be framed as a problem on the playground that involves all children, regardless of their role.\n448 P. O'Connell, D. Pepler and W. Craig\nUsing this strategy, children's awareness can be heightened regarding how their reaction to bullying affects the problem. For example, children could be made aware of the group processes of arousal and disinhibition by exploring how these processes lead students to do things that they wouldn't normally do, or even approve of.\nThe strategy of raising peers' awareness of group processes is evident in existing anti- bullying methods, such as the No Blame Approach (Maines and Robinson, 1992) and the Method of Shared Concern (Pikas, 1989). These approaches address the problem of bullying by making the peer group culpable, and stressing that the group can in \xcc\x84uence bullying episodes. One important aspect of these approaches is the use of the group to heighten empathy toward the victim. By combining an educational approach (i.e. teaching students about group dynamics) with existing group problem solving approaches, students can understand the process of victimization both cognitively and emotionally. In this way, they can become more aware and active in reducing bullying problems among peers.\nPeer attention to the bully\nChildren who simply watch bullying will often contend that they ``aren't doing anything''. In our observations, we found that peers reinforced bullying 54% of the time by passively attending to the episode and not helping the victim. The message for the bully, therefore, is positive: their aggressive behavior draws an attentive audience of peers who comprise a silent majority. Hazler (1996) describes the audience for school bullies as those who ``F F F recognize what is happening yet do not know enough about their roles, emotional reactions, and responsibilities to take viable actions'' (p. 12).\nOur observations draw attention to the importance of including the entire peer group in anti-bullying interventions. While it might be intuitive to focus on the most active participants in bullying episodes (i.e. the bully, victim, and active joiners or interveners), we know now that peers spend a large proportion of their time passively observing during playground bullying. Through their passive observations they are inadvertently reinforcing the bully and giving the message that they approve of his or her actions.\nExisting interventions, for example the Method of Shared Concern (Pikas, 1989), do place an emphasis on the larger peer group, with the message being that children are responsible for helping each other feeling safe and comfortable at school.\nGiven that 83% of children in our Canadian surveys stated that bullying made them feel either ``a bit'' or ``quite'' unpleasant, we would recommend intervention strategies in which peers are taught to attend to their discomfort. A heightened awareness of the negative aspects of bullying might lead peers to spend less time passively viewing, and perhaps increase their active opposition to bullying. When the peer group stops being an audience, the bully's attempts to gain dominance go unnoticed, therefore, the peers' reinforcement of the bully is removed.\nPeer intervention\nPeers spent one-quarter of their time (25%) intervening on behalf of victims during bullying episodes. Our observations of actual amounts of intervention contrast considerably with the questionnaire reports, where fully 41% of students indicated that they ``try to help'' the victim when they observe bullying. The data from the present analyses reveal the relatively small proportion of time that peers actually spent in aiding the victim. Taken together, the questionnaire and observational data suggest that many peers have a positive orientation to intervene, however they hesitate to do so for a variety of reasons.\nPeer involvement in bullying 449\nHawkins et al. (1998) examined how peers intervened using video-taped data drawn from the same sample as the present study. They found that peer interventions were equally likely to be made by boys or girls, and were evenly divided between aggressive and non-aggressive intervening. Interventions directed at the bully were more likely to be aggressive, while interventions directed at the victim were more likely to be non-aggressive. Three-quarters of the peer interventions were effective in stopping bullying. This study con\xc2\xaerms that peers can be effective interveners, while simultaneously raising concerns about some of the intervention strategies that they use.\nSeveral factors need to be considered in developing peer intervention strategies to counter bullying. First, children must be given a mandate to help change entrenched patterns of bully, victim, and peer behaviors. Second, children need strategies in order to intervene effectively. It is important that their interventions not be hostile or aggressive, because these may elicit a counter attack and place the intervener at risk of becoming the next victim. Children will only have the con\xc2\xaedence to intervene when this behavior is promoted in the context of a whole-school anti-bullying initiative. Whole school approaches to countering bullying involve all members of the school community (students, teachers, parents, and administrators) in the development of clear rules and consequences that discourage all forms of aggression (Sharp and Thompson, 1994). With a whole-school policy, children know that adults will follow through and protect interveners when bullying occurs. Whole-school anti- bullying policies should be initiated during elementary school and continue to support students throughout all levels of the school system.\nThe interventions targeting peer processes will need to vary according to developmental level. For example, strategies such as ``Ha Ha, So?'' are appropriate for very young children (Garrity et al., 1994), ``Peacemakers'' is geared towards children in middle grades (Johnson and Johnson, 1996), and peer counseling strategies might best be used by middle and upper level children (Cowie, 1994). Regardless of developmental level, it is essential to recognize the central role that peers have in the maintenance and course of playground bullying, and to promote interventions that effect change at the peer group level.\nLimitations\nAlthough the observational data provide insights into peer processes that are not available through questionnaires, we recognize that there are also limitations to the research. First, the data presented here are largely descriptive. A \xc2\xaene-grained examination of the data, involving sequential analysis of peers' playground behaviors, is presently being conducted and will be reported in a subsequent paper. This strategy will provide more information on the nature of in \xcc\x84uences among the peers, bully, and victim.\nThe observational methodology is also limited. First, some children were self-conscious about wearing microphones: this was particularly true of older children, suggesting that the methodology is more appropriate for younger children. A related concern was that the methodology allowed us to capture overt forms of bullying; indirect bullying was less likely to be identi\xc2\xaeed. Although we observed indirect bullying, it was not coded for the present analysis if the victim was not visible.\nThe level of precision required by the coding scheme allowed us to examine only 57 out of 99 segments for technical reasons. Despite this limitation, our impression is that there was no systematic bias in the type of segment that was eliminated.\nFinally, some non-independence existed in the data because four of the 57 episodes contained a bully who was also involved as a bully in another episode. Duplicate episodes\n450 P. O'Connell, D. Pepler and W. Craig\nwere randomly removed from the analyses, resulting in a \xc2\xaenal sample of 53 video tape segments. We chose to eliminate these episodes because the bully is the central, initiating \xc2\xaegure in bullying episodes. There may have been further non-independence due to peers appearing in more than one segment of video tape. With the quality of \xc2\xaelming, however, it was not possible to identify all peers present during bullying episodes.\nDespite these limitations, the observational data that were coded remain a valuable source of naturalistic information about peer group involvement in bullying episodes, and represent an important step beyond relying on self-reports and other questionnaire data.\nConclusion\nIn summary, our analyses of the observational data con\xc2\xaerm that peers are substantially involved in playground bullying, whether as active participants or as bystanders who are unable or unwilling to act pro-socially. During bullying episodes, 75% of peers' time is spent in ways that may provide positive reinforcement to the bully and do not help the victim.\nEffective interventions that involve the peer group will need to have two components. First, it is important to raise peers' awareness of individual responsibility and increase empathy for the victim. Second, it is necessary to provide effective intervention strategies for children, and to encourage them to withstand the dynamics of the peer group. In combination, these strategies might mobilize the silent majority to act against playground bullying.\nInterventions targeting the peer group in anti-bullying programs must be reinforced by simultaneous broader systemic initiatives. Whole-school approaches which involve students, teachers, school administrators, and parents might successfully challenge existing social conditions that tolerate, and inadvertently promote, bullying and victimization within the peer context.\nAcknowledgements\nWe are indebted to the Toronto Board of Education administrators for their support of this project.

With the advent of modern forms of communication, children are now able to harass their peers with mobile phones and e-mails, a behaviour known as cyberbullying. To determine the relationship between school bullying and cyberbullying, 432 students from grades 7\xe2\x80\x939 in Canadian schools were surveyed about their experiences of bullying. The results indicated that students who were bullied in cyberspace were also likely to bully their peers in cyberspace (r = 0.46, p < 0.001) and be bullied at school (56%). In addition, students who were bullied in cyberspace only, and students bullied both in cyberspace and at school, experienced difficulties at school such as low marks, poor concentration, and absenteeism. These results suggest that bullying that occurs either at or outside school can have an impact on school learning.\nThe Relationship Between Cyberbullying and School Bullying\nSchool bullying became the focus of research in the 1970s; however, a new form of bullying known as cyberbullying (or cyber-harassment) is now becoming known in the 21st century (Beran & Li, 2005). Rather than bully a peer only at school, students are beginning to use technology such as home computers and mobile phones to bully their peers. Few studies on cyberbullying have been published, and its similarity to school bullying is unknown. This study examines whether students involved in school bullying are also involved in cyberbullying, and if these types of bullying are related to academic difficulties at school.\n16\n   \nTHE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CYBERBULLYING AND SCHOOL BULLYING\nRelated Literature\nSchool and cyberbullying\nBullying has traditionally been considered to be a school problem. It usually occurs before an audience of peers and on the school playground (Craig & Pepler, 1997; Olweus, 1993). Although bullying has traditionally been equated with physical harassment, researchers now consider bullying to be exposure, repeatedly and over time, to negative actions on the part of one or more students (Olweus, 2003). These negative actions are considered intentional, whereby individuals inflict or attempt to inflict, injury or discomfort upon someone else (Olweus, 2003). Bullying takes a wide range of forms including hitting, pushing, holding, hostile gesturing, threatening, humiliating, degrading, teasing, name-calling, put-downs, sarcasm, taunting, staring, sticking out the tongue, eye rolling, silent treatment, manipulating friendship and ostracising (Beran, 2006; Ma, 2001).\nA new method of bullying has emerged, known as cyberbullying. This form of aggression involves the use of information and communication technology such as mobile phones, video cameras, e-mails, and web pages to post or send harassing or embarrassing messages to another person (Ybarra & Mitchell, 2004). Different types of cyberbullying have been reported ranging from flaming to cyberstalking. There are seven different categories of common cyberbullying (Willard, 2004):\nFlaming: Sending angry, rude, vulgar messages about a person to an online group or to that person via email or other text messaging.\nOnline harassment: Repeatedly sending offensive messages via email or other text messaging to a person.\nCyberstalking: Online harassment that includes threats of harm or is excessively intimidating.\nDenigration (put-downs): Sending harmful, untrue, or cruel statements about a person to other people or posting such material online.\nMasquerade: Pretending to be someone else and sending or posting material that makes that person look bad.\nOuting: Sending or posting material about a person that contains sensitive, private, or embarrassing information, including forwarding private messages or images.\nExclusion: Cruelly excluding someone from an online group. (Cyberbullying Survey Section, \xc2\xb68)\nFor example, a 15 year-old boy in Quebec, Canada became an unwilling \xe2\x80\x98celebrity when a film he made of himself emulating a Star Wars fight scene was posted on the internet by some classmates. Millions downloaded the two-minute clip ... He was so humiliated he sought counselling [and dropped out of school], and his family has launched a lawsuit against his tormentors\xe2\x80\x99 (Snider & Borel, 2004). In Japan, mobile phone pictures of an overweight boy, which were taken in the locker room, were\n17\n \nTANYA BERAN AND QING LI\ndistributed to many of his peers (Paulson, 2003). Internet use alone has been increasing by 100% per year (Nua Internet Surveys, 2002). In schools, 98% of elementary and 99% of secondary students in Canada have computers with internet connections (Statistics Canada, 2004). Given that about 60% of these students can access the internet outside class time (Statistics Canada, 2004), it is possible that a portion of the time spent on the internet is used to send harassing messages. Thus, in addition to enhancing student learning and interactions with peers, technology may be used to target and victimise peers.\nStudies indicate that 14% to 27% of students experience school bullying (Fekkes et al., 2005; Whitney & Smith, 1993). Preliminary studies suggest that cyberbullying occurs at a similar rate. In a survey of students in grades 7\xe2\x80\x939, we found that about one quarter of students reported being bullied through the use of technology (Beran & Li, 2005). Also, in Canada, survey results show that one quarter of young Canadian internet users received messages expressing hate for others (Mnet, 2001). Similarly, in Britain, 25% of adolescents between 11 and 19 years-of-age reported being cyberbullied (National Children\xe2\x80\x99s Home, 2002). Further, the 2004 i-SAFE survey of 1500 grade 4\xe2\x80\x938 students in the USA (i-SAFE, 2004) and a study conducted by Kennedy in the UK (Kennedy, 2005) showed the same trend. Considering that student use of technology is often unsupervised, fewer consequences may result from bullying peers by using technology than when at school.\nRather than consider cyberbullying as a separate phenomenon we propose that it has become another form of bullying. Bullying behaviours may be directed at a target (e.g., hitting, kicking, name calling, swearing) or involve the peer group to indirectly target another student (e.g., gossiping, excluding) (Bjorkqvist, Lagerspetz, & Kaukiainen, 1992). Cyberbullying is another indirect form whereby the aggressor does not harass in a face-to-face interaction, but rather through an interface (computer screen, phone). Just as school bullying behaviours are likely to be witnessed by peers, harassing messages posted on-line are in a public domain and can be viewed by acquaintances and strangers. For these reasons, it seems likely that bullying at school is related to bullying on-line. Indeed, according to ecological systems theory, peers play a role in maintaining and exacerbating bullying. By extension, the public audience in cyberspace may serve the same role as schoolyard bystanders.\nThe link between school bullying and cyberbullying can be conceptualised using social rank theory. This theory posits that the peer group becomes established as a hierarchy whereby some students use aggression to dominate their peers as a means of gaining prestige, power, and access to resources (Espelage & Swearer, 2003; Pellegrini & Long, 2002). When peers submit to these dominant initiations by crying or feeling intimidated, power and control are exerted over them, which may be maintained over the long term (Sharp, Thompson, & Arora, 2000). Consequently, a child who submits to attacks at school may be at risk of experiencing additional bullying in cyberspace, which can persist over time and in settings outside the school. It is also possible that children\n18\n \nTHE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CYBERBULLYING AND SCHOOL BULLYING\nwho are bullied at school may attempt to retaliate through technology. This form of bullying may be less anxiety-provoking than face-to-face attacks, so victimised children may resort to this behaviour as a means of self-protection. Indeed, they may engage in bullying particularly if they are severely affected by it.\nTo more precisely describe children\xe2\x80\x99s involvement in bullying at school and via technology we can examine their behaviours. Previous research indicates that children who are bullied are also likely to bully others. In a review of the research on bullying at school, Espelage and Swearer (2003) challenged the perception that children can be dichotomously classified as either bullies or victims. They argued that children may bully their peers, and at other times also be bullied by their peers. In its most extreme form, being bullied can lead to homicide. Vossekuil and colleagues (Vossekuil et al., 2002) reported that 71% of students who shot their schoolmates had been bullied. It is, therefore, possible that children who are bullied in cyberspace may also bully others in cyberspace. Moreover, children who are bullied at school are also likely to be bullied on- line.\nEffects of bullying\nPrevious research has shown that children who are bullied at school suffer several maladaptive outcomes. Internalising problems include anxiety, loneliness, sadness, over- compliance, and insecurity (Frost, 1991; Hawker & Boulton, 2000; Olweus, 1989). In addition to these internalising behaviours, children who are bullied may display externalising problems such as impulsiveness and hyperactivity (Camodeca et al., 2003; Johnson et al., 2002). Some school problems have also been reported, but there are few studies on them. Reid (1985) reported that victimised children are likely to avoid school, resulting in absenteeism, and Mellor (1990) indicated poor concentration on schoolwork. These behaviours may explain reports of lower intelligence and academic achievement (Roland, 1987).\nSome emerging studies on cyberbullying suggest that children who are targeted by it display similar negative behaviours. Some published research provides anecdotal insights into children\xe2\x80\x99s experiences (e.g., Keith & Martin, 2005). Some preliminary studies have also documented various behaviours related to cyberbullying including frustration, anger, and sadness (Beran & Li, 2005; Patchin & Hinduja, 2006). Indeed, Patchin and Hinduja (2006) reported that about a third of the children who had been cyberbullied felt they were negatively affected in some way. Also, in a national sample of American youth aged 10\xe2\x80\x9317 years, 30% reported feeling extremely upset and 24% frightened as a result of receiving harassing on-line messages (Finkelhor et al., 2000). Moreover, Ybarra (2004) found that frequent internet users were likely to experience depressive symptoms. Further information about the ways in which children in Canada are affected by cyberbullying is needed, and it is not known if students who experience cyberbullying have similar problems to students who are bullied at school.\n19\n \nTANYA BERAN AND QING LI\nAlthough many teachers and administrators now recognise the problem of cyber bullying, they may not be aware of individual incidents, just as parents are not always aware of their children\xe2\x80\x99s activities on-line (Media Awareness Network, 2001). However, school districts have begun including cyber-harassment in school policy (e.g., Ontario Public School Boards\xe2\x80\x99 Association, 2007). To inform policy, researchers must examine systematically the nature of cyberbullying. Bullying occurs through electronic communication, yet it is unclear how it works among peers. As bullying becomes recognised as an important problem, researchers must uncover information about its occurrence to inform and support educators and parents. That children who are bullied may form supportive relationships with people over the internet who may encourage them to retaliate with aggression towards their aggressors, suggests that school bullying may be related to the use of technology (Markward et al., 2002). Moreover, cyberbullying may be of particular concern if educators and parents are less conversant with technology than students themselves. Thus, researchers, parents, teachers, administrators and students must gain a better understanding of cyberbullying to ensure safe and appropriate applications for technology. This study will extend our understanding of cyberbullying by examining its relationship with school bullying among adolescents. In particular, we asked the following questions:\n1. To what extent are bullying others in cyberspace and being bullied in cyberspace related?\n2. Are students who are bullied at school likely to be bullied in cyberspace?\n3. Are students who experience both forms of bullying (cyberbullying and school bullying) as likely to have difficulty functioning at school as students who experience cyberbullying only?\nMethod\nData for this sample were collected as part of a larger study (Beran & Li, 2005). Administrators from nine junior high schools in middle class, ethnically diverse communities in Calgary were contacted and gave permission for the research. Participants included 432 students (193 boys and 239 girls) in grades 7\xe2\x80\x939 (ages 12\xe2\x80\x9315) who completed a self-report survey. Only those adolescents with signed parental consent were permitted to participate. A research assistant gave questionnaires to students in class and told them that they were not obliged to complete the questionnaire and not to state their names to ensure anonymity. Approximately 15 minutes was required to complete the questionnaire.\nMeasures\nTo determine whether students experienced cyberbullying they were first read the standard definition of bullying developed by Olweus (1996) that is frequently used in research:\n20\n \nTHE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CYBERBULLYING AND SCHOOL BULLYING\nHarassment occurs when a student, or several students, says mean and hurtful things or makes fun of another student or calls him or her mean and hurtful names, completely ignores or excludes him or her from their group of friends or leaves him or her out of things on purpose, tells lies or spreads false rumors about him or her, sends mean notes and tries to make other students dislike him or her, and other hurtful things like that. When we talk about harassment, these things happen repeatedly, and it is difficult for the student being harassed to defend himself or herself. We also call it harassment, when a student is teased repeatedly in a mean and hurtful way. But we don\xe2\x80\x99t call it harassment when the teasing is done in a friendly and playful way. Also, it is not harassment when two students of about equal strength or power argue or fight.\nThen they were asked, \xe2\x80\x98Have harassing behaviours involving technology been directed towards you?\xe2\x80\x99 To determine the relationship between cyberbullying and school bullying, students were asked \xe2\x80\x98Do the people who harassed you by using technology also harass you in other ways (not using technology)?\xe2\x80\x99 Students were then asked: \xe2\x80\x98Do you use technology to harass others?\xe2\x80\x99 Students responded to these three questions on a 5- point response scale from \xe2\x80\x98never\xe2\x80\x99 to \xe2\x80\x98almost every day\xe2\x80\x99 with higher scores indicating a higher frequency of bullying. See Appendix 1 for details of the survey. Self reported experiences of bullying are often used in research and are considered to be a valid method for determining the frequency of bullying (Espelage & Swearer, 2003).\nTo determine whether bullying is related to difficulties at school, students were asked if they missed school, had difficulty concentrating, or if their marks dropped because of bullying. Responses were indicated on the same 5-point response scale from \xe2\x80\x98never\xe2\x80\x99 to \xe2\x80\x98almost every day\xe2\x80\x99, and a higher score indicated more difficulty. This self- reporting method has been used in other studies on bullying (e.g., Hawker & Boulton, 1996; Sharp, 1995; Sharp et al., 2000) and provides a glimpse into a child\xe2\x80\x99s experience of cyberbullying and its perceived effect.\nResults\nThe number of students who had been involved in bullying was first examined. As shown in Table 1, 182 students (42%) had never experienced cyberbullying, whereas 248 students (58%) had experienced it once or twice, or more often. Fewer students (n = 109, 26%) reported bullying others in cyberspace once or twice, or more often. Also, more than a third of students (n = 159, 37%) reported being bullied both in cyberspace and at school once or twice, or more often. To examine differences in reports of being bullied and bullying others, responses to the three bullying questions were re-coded to never, once/twice, or a few times or more. Chi-square results showed no significant gender or grade differences.\n21\n  \nTANYA BERAN AND QING LI\nTable 1: Frequency of cyberbullying and school bullying (n = 432)\n   Frequency of each response\n   Never Once/twice Few Many Almost Total* times times every day\n   Bullied in cyberspace 182 148 81 15 4 430\n Bullied others in 318 94 6 6 3 427 cyberspace\n Bullied in cyberspace 268 92 32 24 11 427 and at school\n Note. *The totals do not add up to 432 due to missing values.\nTo explore the relationships among the various experiences of bullying, Spearman\xe2\x80\x99s rho coefficients for ordinal data were calculated using the original 5- point response scale. As shown in Table 2, students who were bullied in cyberspace were also likely to bully others in cyberspace and be bullied at school. Also, children who were bullied both in cyberspace and at school were likely to bully others in cyberspace.\nTable 2: Spearman\xe2\x80\x99s rho for the relationship between experiences of bullying and school functioning (n = 432)\n  Measures Bullied in Bullied cyberspace others in\ncyberspace\nBullied in Missed Marks Poor cyberspace school dropped concentration\nand at school\n  Bullied in -- cyberspace\n Bullied others 0.46* -- in cyberspace\n Bullied in 0.52* 0.32* -- cyberspace\nand at school\n22\nTHE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CYBERBULLYING AND SCHOOL BULLYING\n*p < 0.001\nTable 2 also shows how cyberbullying is related to school functioning. Students who were cyberbullied were likely to miss school, obtain low marks, and have poor concentration. These difficulties were also reported by students who experienced both cyberbullying and school bullying. Moreover, schooling problems are moderately correlated\xe2\x80\x94students who had difficulty concentrating also gained low marks and were more likely to skip school. For those students who admitted bullying others in cyberspace, no difficulties at school other than poor concentration were reported. It was not possible to re-code responses to determine gender or grade differences, as cell sizes were too small.\nDiscussion\nTechnology is intended to create rich learning environments and introduce children to new ideas, develop new skills, and expand their perspectives (Bailey & Cotlar, 1994). Many parents may also buy their children mobile phones to help ensure their safety. However, technology when used to harass someone, can inflict harm and reduce school functioning for some children. Indeed, more than half of the students in our sample had experienced some cyberbullying, and more than a quarter of students reported bullying others in cyberspace at least once. Also, more than a third had been bullied both in cyberspace and at school. These forms of bullying are interrelated\xe2\x80\x94children who were bullied in cyberspace were also likely to bully others in cyberspace and be bullied at school. Moreover, children who were bullied in cyberspace, as well as children bullied both in cyberspace and at school, were likely to function poorly at school. To a lesser extent, children who engaged in cyberbullying had difficulty with school work.\nStudents who are bullied through technology are likely to use technology to bully others. It is possible that children who are bullied retaliate against the aggressor by returning angry statements (flames) and sending harassing messages. It is also plausible, however, that children known to have harassed others using technology are targeted by other children to get even to protect their friends. Each incident may then fuel further assaults by students directly involved, as well by their peers. When people feel angry for being wrongfully attacked they may respond aggressively (Geen, 1998). Another explanation for retaliation against bullying is that the retaliation may serve to protect the\n23\n  Missed school 0.17* 0.08 0.20* --\n Marks 0.22* 0.07 0.20* 0.46* -- dropped\n Poor 0.43* 0.18* 0.37* 0.28* 0.48* -- concentration\n \nTANYA BERAN AND QING LI\ntargeted student from feelings of embarrassment, sadness and powerlessness (Beattie, 2005). In other words, a child who is bullied may \xe2\x80\x98bully back\xe2\x80\x99 to counteract negative emotions about having been bullied.\nConsidering that more than a third of the children in our sample who were bullied in cyberspace were also bullied at school, it is possible that bullying moves between the school grounds and cyberspace. For example, a student may be targeted at school and then later that day sent harassing messages at his or her home. Then, they may be further harassed at school the following day. Given that our results also show that students bullied at school and via technology are likely to bully others in cyberspace, incidents of bullying may be complex. Perhaps a student who had been bullied at school comes to see bullying as a means of fitting in with the peer group by following the group\xe2\x80\x99s social rules, and will, therefore, begin to bully others in cyberspace. As a result, this person may be subsequently targeted by threatening messages left on her or his desk or mobile phone. In other words, with the ready availability of technology, bullying may involve many students at school, at home, and at almost any other time and place in a child\xe2\x80\x99s life where technology is accessible.\nThe frequency of students experiencing cyberbullying a few times or more often is comparable to that of school bullying. In general, many reports of school bullying show that about a quarter or less of students are bullied at least sometimes at school (McEachern et al., 2005). Similarly, almost a quarter of the students in our sample stated they had been bullied through the internet, e-mails, mobile phones, and so on at least a few times. Most (34%) of the students in the sample were bullied only once or twice. Similarly, of those students who engaged in cyberbullying, most stated that they did it only once or twice. Perhaps when learning the capabilities of technology, students test what they are able to do with it by engaging in aggressive behaviours. However, fear of being caught may restrain them. It is also likely that students are reluctant to report more frequent acts of being bullied and of bullying others for fear of having their use of technology curtailed, despite reassurances of confidentiality for the research.\nStudents may engage in cyberbullying for several reasons: the source of the bullying is difficult to detect as messages can be sent without personal identification; a child who sends a harassing message has time to construct and carefully prepare the message to maximise the harm it causes; in traditional school bullying it may be hard to create hurtful messages during the day; and there may be little fear of physical or verbal retaliation as it is difficult to identify the sender, and the victim and sender are usually physically remote from each other.\nStudents who were bullied either in cyberspace or at school were likely to report difficulties at school. They were less likely to attend school, could not concentrate on their school work and gained lower marks than students who were not bullied. These results are consistent with research showing a negative effect on students who are bullied at school (Juvonen et al., 2000; Kochenderfer & Ladd, 1996). Thus, regardless of the\n24\n \nTHE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CYBERBULLYING AND SCHOOL BULLYING\nform of bullying (school or technologically based), students are likely to be harmed. Perhaps sadness and hurt feelings about the attack distract students from their work and reduce their motivation to attend school, both resulting in low grades. The converse is also possible. Difficulty with schoolwork may mean that students are ostracised by their peers, making them targets for teasing, ridicule and bullying. Moreover, children who engage in cyber-harassment may be preoccupied with thoughts of targeting their peers, reducing concentration on schoolwork. These results underscore the significance of cyberbullying.\nThe results of this study suggest a connection between school bullying and cyberbullying. An important implication is that bullying is a multifaceted phenomenon involving various behaviours at differing times, possibly involving many people. Considering that the majority of bullying occurs before peer witnesses, their role in maintaining or exacerbating bullying must also be considered to be a key component in prevention and intervention programs. Cyberbullying intervention programs, therefore, should be developed in conjunction with anti-bullying programs. This concurs with the limited number of existing intervention strategies proposed (Trolley et al., 2006) in the literature. These stress the importance of a holistic approach to address cyberbullying. Further, it suggests that addressing cyberbullying in the schools requires collaborative efforts among school officials, parents, and the broader society (Trolley et al., 2006).\nLimitations of the study\nDespite providing one of the first glimpses of the impact of cyberbullying on children in Canadian schools, this study has limitations. Although the sample was randomly selected, few students returned consent forms, meaning that the findings are difficult to generalise. At the time the survey was conducted, few students had access to video mobile phones. With the introduction of new technology, cyberbullying may increase; this requires further investigation. In this survey, students were not asked how they were bullied at school or whether they bullied others at school\xe2\x80\x94this should be considered in later research.\nRecommendations for further research\nLittle research has focused on cyberbullying and intervention strategies have not yet been evaluated. When considering the impact of cyberbullying, it is important to examine whether this experience preceded socio-emotional behaviours, so that causality can be taken into account. Student reports on cyberbullying are valid for understanding the child\xe2\x80\x99s perspective, and our results using this method are similar to other methods used to study the effects of bullying. In addition, parents and teachers may be less aware of cyberbullying than are children themselves. Nevertheless, additional reporting sources can be included in future research to compare children\xe2\x80\x99s and adults\xe2\x80\x99 perspectives.\n25\n \nTANYA BERAN AND QING LI\nOther areas for further study include using school measures such as attendance records and grades to understand how children experience bullying. Also, direct and indirect bullying should be compared separately with cyberbullying. Our exploration of cyberbullying required qualitative methods to determine the nature and possible causes of this new phenomenon. The sample in this study was limited to students in grades 7\xe2\x80\x939 in Canadian schools who were willing to participate and no grade differences were found in reports of cyberbullying. It is suggested that the age range be expanded to include younger and older students and that gender differences by simultaneously examined.\nGiven that many students who are bullied in cyberspace both bully others in cyberspace and are bullied at school suggests that \xe2\x80\x98bullying has gone digital\xe2\x80\x99. Researchers must examine all forms of bullying to develop a complete understanding of how and why students harass their peers. This study\xe2\x80\x99s findings lead to many questions yet to be answered in the research. As we learn more about the direction, severity and context of these behaviours, we will be able to develop and evaluate strategies to manage it. At present, parents and educators must be aware that cyberbullying and school bullying are harmful to children and may impede their learning at school.\n 26\nTHE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CYBERBULLYING AND SCHOOL BULLYING\nReferences\nBailey EK & Cotlar M, 1994, \xe2\x80\x98Teaching via the internet\xe2\x80\x99.

When we talk about harassment, these things happen repeatedly, and it is difficult for the student being harassed to defend himself or herself. We also call it harassment, when a student is teased repeatedly in a mean and hurtful way. But we don\xe2\x80\x99t call it harassment when the teasing is done in a friendly and playful way. Also, it is not harassment when two students of about equal strength or power argue or fight.\n1) Have you heard of students using technology to harass other students (for example, the Internet, computers, cell phones, answering machines, video cameras)?

The study tested the effectiveness of MRSDT in reducing substance use among high school students.\nMethods: Cluster randomized trial included 36 high schools and more than 4,700 9th through 12th grade students. After baseline data collection in spring 2007, about half the schools were randomly assigned to a treatment group that was permitted to implement MRSDT immediately, and the remaining half were assigned to a control group that delayed MRSDT until after follow-up data collection was completed 1 year later, in spring 2008. Data from self-administered student questionnaires were used to compare rates of substance use in treatment and control schools at follow-up.\nResults: Students subject to MRSDT by their districts reported less substances use in past 30 days compared with students in schools without MRSDT. The program had no detectable spillover effects on the substance use of students not subject to testing. We found no evidence of unintentional negative effects on students\xe2\x80\x99 future intentions to use substances, the proportion of students who participated in activities subject to drug testing, or on students\xe2\x80\x99 attitudes toward school and perceived consequences of substance use.\nConclusions: MRSDT shows promise in reducing illicit substance use among high school students.

The most recent national estimates indicate that 14% of U.S. public school districts conducted ran- dom drug testing during the 2004 \xe2\x80\x932005 school year [1]. Two U.S. Supreme Court decisions have upheld the use of MRSDT for students participating in athletics and in other extracurricular activities [2,3].\nMRSDT may reduce student substance use in one or more of three ways. First, the threat of testing alone may cause students to stop using substances. Such deterrent effects are most likely to occur when students are directly subject to testing (e.g., during the school sports seasons) and for the specific substances cov- ered by the school\xe2\x80\x99s drug testing policy. Second, school staff can identify students who test positive for drugs and refer them to counseling services. The opportunity for such detection effects is\n 1054-139X/$ - see front matter   2012 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

Third, MRSDT may have spillover effects on students who are not di- rectly subject to testing, as they observe and are influenced by the behavior of their peers.\nThe few previous studies of MRSDT offer little definitive evi- dence on the effectiveness of these programs. Quasi-experimental studies of MRSDT programs conducted in New Jersey, Indiana, and Oregon high schools have found a link between MRSDT and lower substance use [4 \xe2\x80\x93 6]. However, national surveys have found no statistically significant differences in substance use between schools with and without drug testing programs [7,8]. A previous experimental study of MRSDT produced mixed results\xe2\x80\x94reduced past-year substance use at two of the four follow-up periods, but showed no effect on past-month use [9]. Some research suggests that MRSDT may have unin- tended negative consequences on students\xe2\x80\x99 attitudes toward school, sports and activities participation, and other risk fac- tors for future substance use [6,9].\nThe present study sought to add to prior research by ad- dressing three questions: (1) Does MRSDT reduce substance use among students who are subject to testing? (2) Are there spillover effects on other students? (3) Does MRSDT have unintended negative effects on students\xe2\x80\x99 attitudes or activity participation?\nMethods\nParticipants\nA total of 4,720 9th through 12th grade students from 36 high schools participated in the study (All student sample sizes are rounded to the nearest 10 in accordance with National Center for Education Statistics publication policy). The schools received grants to implement MRSDT from a competitive discretionary federal grant program administered by the U.S. Department of Education\xe2\x80\x99s Office of Safe and Drug Free Schools, which awarded grants to schools for MRSDT between 2005 and 2008. School districts awarded grants in 2006 were required to participate in the study as a condition of their grant awards. The districts were located in seven states, primarily in the South and Midwest.\nStudy design\nThe study was designed as a cluster randomized trial with staggered implementation of the intervention. Because MRSDT programs are implemented schoolwide, with expectations of spillover to students not directly covered by the MRSDT pro- gram, we randomly assigned schools rather than individual stu- dents. After we collected baseline data in spring 2007, 20 schools were randomly assigned to a treatment group that was permit- ted to begin implementing MRSDT immediately, and 16 schools were assigned to a control group that had to delay announcing, promoting, or implementing MRSDT until after the follow-up survey was completed in spring 2008. Impacts were calculated during the 1-year period of staggered implementation. The study was approved by the Portland State University Human Subjects Research Review Committee.\nRandom assignment was conducted separately within 15 blocks of two to four schools. Blocks were formed, first, by group- ing schools within the seven grantee school districts and, second, by grouping schools with similar characteristics within the three largest districts. The study was powered to detect impacts simi-\nlar to those reported in previous studies of MRSDT [6]. The final analytical sample of 4,720 students and 36 schools yielded min- imum detectable impacts of 7.2 percentage points on a dichoto- mous substance use outcome with 30% prevalence among the control group [10].\nIntervention\nEach participating school district began by specifying a list of sports and other extracurricular activities it planned to cover under its testing policy. In treatment schools, participation in these covered activities was then restricted to students provid- ing written consent to MRSDT, and these consenting students were subject to random drug testing periodically throughout the school year.\nThe OSDFS grant program required all districts to follow a basic set of testing procedures: administering tests to a mini- mum of 50% of eligible students, testing for a minimum of five required substances (marijuana, amphetamines, cocaine, meth- amphetamines, and opiates), establishing safeguards to main- tain the confidentiality of the drug test results, subjecting any positive tests to review by a certified medical-review officer, and referring students with positive drug test results to treatment services. Although not explicitly required by the grant program, all districts contracted with an outside drug testing company to administer the tests.\nOther implementation decisions were left to the discretion of the individual grantees. The frequency of drug testing ranged across schools from four times per year to five or six times per month. Three districts tested for alcohol in addition to drugs. Five districts tested both student athletes and participants in compet- itive extracurricular activities (e.g., marching band and choir); two districts limited MRSDT to student athletes. In four districts, students who participated in covered activities were subject to testing all year, whereas in the three other districts, students who participated in covered activities were subject to testing only while participating in the activity. During the period of the grant awards, the amount of OSDFS funding received ranged across districts from $18 to $120 per enrolled student.\nAcross the seven grantee districts, 3,480 drug tests were con- ducted during the study\xe2\x80\x99s 1-year evaluation period. Of these tests, 40 positive drug tests were reported. Positive drug tests were most common for marijuana (20/40 positive drug tests). The rate of positive drug tests\xe2\x80\x94 40 of 3,480 tests\xe2\x80\x94was lower than the rate at which students reported using substances, which is consistent with reports in the literature [11].\nSchools assigned to both the treatment and control groups were permitted to continue implementing other substance use prevention efforts they had in place before the study. Staff in 74% of treatment schools and 68% of control schools reported offering substance use prevention assemblies, 100% of treatment schools and 63% of control schools reported offering substance use pre- vention curricula, and 16% of treatment schools and 25% of con- trol schools reported offering behavioral or therapeutic counsel- ing for students. Therefore, the study measured the effects of MRSDT as a supplement to these other substance use prevention efforts.\nData collection\nData were collected from students through questionnaires administered at baseline in spring 2007 and follow-up in spring\nS. James-Burdumy et al. / Journal of Adolescent Health 50 (2012) 172\xe2\x80\x93178 173\n174 S. James-Burdumy et al. / Journal of Adolescent Health 50 (2012) 172\xe2\x80\x93178\n2008. Responses to the questionnaires were confidential and linked across baseline and follow-up surveys using anonymous study ID numbers. For the baseline survey, we drew a stratified random sample of 9th through 11th grade students in each par- ticipating school. Students from this sample who remained in study schools were reinterviewed for the follow-up survey in spring 2008 as 10th through 12th graders. The study did not have resources to track students who moved out of study districts. For the spring 2008 follow-up survey, we also drew a stratified random sample of new 9th grade students who entered study schools for the 2007\xe2\x80\x932008 school year. Thus, the final analytical sample represents 9th through 12th grade students at the time of the spring 2008 follow-up survey.\nPrimary outcome\nTo measure substance use, we asked students on the baseline and follow-up surveys how frequently they used each of 10 different substances (alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, cocaine, etc.) over three reference periods: the past 30 days, the past 6 months, and ever in their lifetimes. We modeled the questions after sim- ilar items on the national Monitoring the Future Survey. We used responses to these items to create binary composite measures (yes/no) of the following: use of any substance; use of any sub- stance excluding alcohol and tobacco; and use of any substance that was covered under the drug testing policy of the student\xe2\x80\x99s district. We constructed separate measures for past 30-day and 6-month use.\nSecondary outcomes\nPerceived consequences of substance use. To test for unintended negative consequences on students\xe2\x80\x99 attitudes toward substance use, we included measures of both perceived negative and per- ceived positive consequences of substance use. Both scales were derived from a prior study on MRSDT [6] and had high internal reliability (for both scales, the alpha coefficient for the follow-up survey was .85). For the measure of perceived negative conse- quences, we asked students whether they agreed or disagreed with statements, such as \xe2\x80\x9cUsing illegal drugs leads to serious health problems\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cIf I used drugs, I would get into trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d For the measure of perceived positive consequences, we used different statements\xe2\x80\x94for example, \xe2\x80\x9cUsing illegal drugs or alco- hol makes it easier to be part of a group\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cUsing illegal drugs or drinking is cool.\xe2\x80\x9d\nParticipation in covered activities. To test for possible effects on student participation rates in activities subject to testing, we measured covered-activity participation with a binary indicator of whether the student participated in a covered activity any time during the 2007\xe2\x80\x932008 school year.\nSchool connectedness. To test for possible unintended negative effects on students\xe2\x80\x99 attitudes toward school, we included a 16- item scale measuring students\xe2\x80\x99 connection to school. The scale was developed in a prior study on school connection [12] and has high internal reliability (the alpha coefficient on the follow-up\nsurvey was .89). For this measure, we asked students whether they agreed or disagreed with statements, such as \xe2\x80\x9cI feel like I belong at this school\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cAdults at this school listen to student concerns.\xe2\x80\x9d\nStatistical methods\nTo test for baseline differences between the treatment and control groups, we conducted descriptive analyses of baseline data, using two-tailed t tests adjusted for the clustering of stu- dents within schools. We included any measures showing statis- tically significant baseline differences as covariates in the impact analysis.\nTo measure the impacts of MRSDT on student substance use and other dichotomous outcomes, we estimated multivariate logistic regression models that included a binary indicator of treatment status, random assignment block indicator variables, and any demographic or outcome measures that showed statis- tically significant baseline differences. We adjusted the standard errors for the clustering of students within schools, using the generalized estimating equations approach. We constructed weights to adjust for random assignment, sampling, consent, and nonresponse probabilities. We grouped students by the schools they attended at the time they were sampled, which yielded \xe2\x80\x9cintent-to-treat\xe2\x80\x9d estimates of the program\xe2\x80\x99s impact. For continuous outcomes, we estimated comparable linear regression models.\nWe conducted the analyses separately for two analysis sam- ples. First, to answer our primary research question of whether MRSDT affects the substance use and attitudes of students who are subject to testing, we limited the analysis to students who participated in athletics or other extracurricular activities cov- ered by their district\xe2\x80\x99s testing program during the 2007\xe2\x80\x932008 school year. For example, in districts where football and soccer were covered activities, we examined treatment-control differ- ences in substance use reported by football and soccer players. Second, to examine our secondary question of whether MRSDT has spillover effects on other students in the school, we limited the analysis to students who did not participate in covered activ- ities during the 2007\xe2\x80\x932008 school year.\nTo control for multiple hypothesis testing, we adjusted p values from the regression models to control the familywise error rate at 5%. The adjustment is based on the multivariate t-distribution and takes into account correlations among test statistics [13]. We applied the adjustment separately for each analysis sample (activity participants or nonparticipants) and for each group of related outcome measures (self-reported sub- stance use, intention to use substances, perceived consequences of substance use, covered-activity participation, or connection to school).\nResults\nFlow of study participants\nConsent and survey response rates were generally similar for the treatment and control groups (Table 1). Among the students originally sampled for the study, 82% of the treatment group and 80% of the control group were still enrolled in study schools at the time of follow-up.

We achieved a 90% survey response rate among consenting students (92% for the treatment group vs. 89% for the control group). Among those students who completed a follow-up survey, baseline data were available for 52% of the treatment group and 46% of the control group. No schools dropped out of the study after random assignment.\nBaseline characteristics\nThe random assignment of schools yielded treatment and control groups that were similar at baseline (Table 2). For the sample of students who participated in activities covered by their district\xe2\x80\x99s MRSDT policy during the 2007\xe2\x80\x932008 school year, we observed one statistically significant difference among the 27 variables examined: students in the treatment group were less likely to be 16 years old than students in the control group. We found no statistically significant baseline differences for the sam- ple of students who did not participate in covered activities [10].\nImpacts on substance use for covered-activity participants\nStudents subject to MRSDT reported less substance use than comparable students in high schools without MRSDT (Table 3). In particular, covered-activity participants in treatment schools were significantly less likely than comparable students in control schools without MRSDT to report any past 30-day use of substances cov- ered by their district\xe2\x80\x99s MRSDT policy (effect size    .21). Rates of self-reported substance use were also lower for covered-activity participants in treatment schools than for those in control schools on the other five substance use measures, although these differences were not statistically significant after accounting for multiple hypothesis testing.\nSpillover effects\nMRSDT had no statistically significant spillover effects on the retrospective substance use reported by students not participat- ing in covered activities (Table 4). For nonparticipants, we found no statistically significant differences in self-reported substance use between the treatment and control schools.\nUnintentional negative effects\nWe found no evidence of unintentional negative conse- quences on any secondary outcome measure. For the measures of intentions to use substances, activity participants in the treat- ment schools were just as likely as those in the control schools to say they intended to use substances in the next year (Table 3). Thirty-four percent of students subject to MRSDT reported that they \xe2\x80\x9cdefinitely will\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cprobably will\xe2\x80\x9d use substances in the next 12 months, compared with 33% of comparable students in schools without MRSDT. Results were similar for the sample of nonparticipants (Table 4).\nWe found no statistically significant program impacts on stu- dents\xe2\x80\x99 attitudes toward school or perceived consequences of substance use. For covered-activity participants, students in the treatment and control groups reported similar scores on the school connectedness scale and two measures of perceived con- sequences of substance use (Table 3). We found similar results for the sample of nonparticipants (Table 4).\nWe found no evidence that MRSDT affected participation rates in athletics and other extracurricular activities covered by drug testing. At follow-up, 53% of students in treatment schools reported participating in an activity covered by MRSDT, com- pared with 54% of students in high schools without MRSDT (not shown). This difference was not statistically significant.\nDiscussion\nMRSDT shows promise in curbing illicit substance use among high school students.

However, the lack of impacts on all second- ary outcomes runs counter to prior research findings that random drug testing may have unintentional negative conse- quences on students\xe2\x80\x99 attitudes toward school and other risk factors for future substance use [6,9]. This discrepant finding could reflect differences in the study samples or features of the particular MRSDT programs studied. For example, in the one prior experimental study of MRSDT [9], the testing program was limited to student athletes (and did not include partici- pants in other extracurricular activities), testing was con- ducted on a more uniform biweekly schedule, the testing was conducted by study personnel (not outside contractors), and the tests were analyzed for a consistent set of nine substances across study schools.\nThe pattern of our results provides some suggestive evidence about how MRSDT may affect student substance use. We found no support for the hypothesis that MRSDT works primarily by identifying and treating students with substance use prob- lems, as the percentage of positive tests (about 1%) was much smaller than the estimated program impact (about 5 percent- age points). Similarly, we found no support for the hypothesis\nthat MRSDT has spillover effects on students who are not subject to testing. Thus, the findings are most consistent with the explanation that MRSDT deters substance use through the threat of testing.\nLimitations\nThe generalizability of the study findings is limited in three ways. First, the impacts for this study were measured for a 1-year period and may not represent longer term effects. Second, the consent rate for the study was   60%, and so findings may not generalize to all sampled students or to the overall student body. It is possible that the students who denied consent for the study were at greater risk for substance use, and the effects of MRSDT on these nonconsenting students remain unknown. Third, be- cause this study focused on a select sample of districts that applied for and received OSDFS grants, the findings may not generalize to all high schools nationwide.\nWe found no evidence of bias from our reliance on self- reported substance use measures. Recent evidence comparing survey data with biological tests indicates that adolescents un- derreport their use of illicit substances on self-reported surveys [14]. However, such underreporting cannot explain the pattern\nTable 3\nImpacts of MRSDT for participants in covered activities\nof our results unless the level of underreporting was higher for students in the treatment than in the control schools. In addi- tional analyses not reported in this article, we found no such evidence of treatment-control differences in the level of under- reporting [10].\nIn addition, we did not find evidence of bias from limiting our main analysis sample to the subgroup of students who partici- pated in covered activities. If MRSDT affects the proportion or types of students who participate in covered activities (e.g., by making drug users less likely to participate or nonusers more likely to participate), these groups might not be comparable across the treatment and control schools. However, the results of the study found that MRSDT did not affect the participation rate in athletics and in other extracurricular activities. Moreover, in a\nTable 4\nImpacts of MRSDT for nonparticipants\nseparate set of analyses, we also estimated impacts for student subgroups defined by students\xe2\x80\x99 participation in activities the year before random assignment (2006 \xe2\x80\x932007 school year), which could not have been affected by MRSDT. The results of these analyses show impacts similar to those reported in the present study for students who participated in covered activities during the 2007\xe2\x80\x932008 school year [10].\nFinally, although we found no evidence of unintentional neg- ative consequences on rates of activity participation or students\xe2\x80\x99 attitudes toward school and perceived consequences of sub- stance use, we were unable to test for other possible negative consequences (e.g., students increasing their use of nontested substances or consuming diuretics or other chemicals to falsify their test results).\nS.

James-Burdumy et al. / Journal of Adolescent Health 50 (2012) 172\xe2\x80\x93178\nDirections for future research\nOur findings suggest three important directions for future research. First, studies should examine whether our findings generalize to national samples of schools and longer term follow-up periods. In looking at the long-term effects, of partic- ular importance is understanding whether changes in student behavior are limited to the period of drug testing or carry over to periods when students are not directly subject to testing (e.g., during summer break or after graduation). Second, studies should more directly explore the mechanisms through which MRSDT may influence student behaviors, focusing especially on possible deterrent effects. Studies should also explore in greater detail the possible unintended negative consequences of MRSDT. Finally, benefit-cost analyses are needed to determine whether MRSDT is cost-effective relative to other substance use preven- tion programs, and to help school and district officials in deciding whether to pursue MRSDT in their local communities.\nReferences\n[1] Ringwalt C, Vincus AA, Ennett ST, et al.

One option relates to the use of drug testing to detect drug use. Drug detection allows for the advantages afforded by early and brief interventions. However, to date, little rigorous or systematic atten- tion has been directed to an examination of drug testing as it might be applied within a school setting. To address this, the National Centre for Education and Training on Addiction (NCETA) undertook a comprehensive and critical review of relevant issues involved in school drug testing and an examination of potential impacts and implications.\nThe review involved issues related to (i) prevention and drug education, including the protective and enhancing roles schools can play; (ii) drug testing in various contexts; (iii) the efficacy and accu- racy of drug testing; (iv) the costs of implementation; (v) ethical and\n\xe2\x88\x97 Corresponding author at: Flinders University, National Centre for Education and Training, Bedford Park, SA5042, Australia.

Such strategies have been applied in workplaces, sporting arenas, prisons and more latterly school settings. They are predicated on a belief in their efficacy in reducing drug-related harm, a need to \xe2\x80\x98send the right\xe2\x80\x99 message to potential users and to reassure the community at large that \xe2\x80\x98something is being done.\xe2\x80\x99 Rigorous examination is required of purported benefits of drug testing in schools.\nMethods: A comprehensive examination was made of testing efficacy and accuracy. Australian legal and ethical issues, encompassing duty of care, rights of the child and privacy determinations, were juxtaposed with that of the United States of America.\nResults: Evidence examined indicates no compelling case for the application of drug testing and that caution should be applied when considering drug testing as a drug detection and prevention strategy in the school setting.\nConclusion: While this review did not support school drug testing, there are alternative evidence-based strategies that schools can implement to prevent drug-related problems among student populations.\n   Crown Copyright \xc2\xa9 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The review was undertaken from a public health perspective and involved assessing patterns and prevalence of use, identifying associated risk and protective factors, and monitoring the impact of interventions known to reduce risk factors and enhance pro- tective factors (Hawkins, Catalano, & Arthur, 2002). Full results of the review, the methodology applied and key theoretical issues are presented elsewhere (Roche et al., 2008).\nThe current paper focuses on three select aspects of the review: (1) the efficacy of drug testing to deter use, (2) the accuracy of tests used and (3) the ethical and legal implications of testing Aus- tralian school-aged children. A brief examination of evidence-based alternatives to school drug testing is also provided.\nThe rationale for school drug testing\nDrug testing is sometimes viewed as an appealing strategy to deal with drug use among school-age children as it is assumed to deter initiation of drug use and encourage cessation; detect users in order to refer them to treatment/counselling; reduce drug-related harm by improving young people\xe2\x80\x99s physical and psychological well- being and in doing so reduce truancy and behavioural problems and improve educational outcomes. What drug testing does not pur- port to do is to provide a measure of intoxication or impairment; determine the quantity, frequency or context of drug use; distin- guish between experimental, occasional or one-off users and those\n   0955-3959/$ \xe2\x80\x93 see front matter.

Applied to drug testing, deterrence theory assumes the individual weighs up the rewards and costs of being detected by a drug test before making a choice to use or not use drugs. However, there are several problems with this assump- tion. Perceptions of drug use detection differ by age and gender, with younger people, especially males, least likely to believe that they will get caught using drugs (Marlowe, Festinger, Foltz, Lee, & Patapis, 2005). It is also possible that offenders will succumb to the \xe2\x80\x98gambler\xe2\x80\x99s fallacy\xe2\x80\x99, believing that they would be very unlikely, or unlucky, to be caught again. Some research evidence suggests that the least experienced and/or most impulsive individuals (i.e., young people) are more likely to hold this belief (Pogarsky & Piquero, 2003). According to deterrence theory, sanctions are seen as a nec- essary component to ensure that a testing program has a deterrent effect (Schaub, 2004); the guiding principle being that sanctions discourage offenders from repeating the infraction. However, impo- sition of sanctions in the school setting may be counterproductive if they further exacerbate risk factors, such as low self-esteem, poor academic performance, or lack of commitment to school\xe2\x80\x94factors known to be associated with drug use (Hawkins et al., 2002). Key assumptions underpinning various rationales for school drug testing and their limitations were highlighted in a recent United Kingdom report (McKeganey, 2005) (see Table 1).\nThe effectiveness of school drug testing in deterring drug use\nEvidence of the effectiveness of school drug testing programs to deter use is scarce, generally limited in scope and poor in quality. An extensive search of peer-reviewed and grey literature revealed a large literature on drug testing programs for school-aged children, the overwhelming majority of which comprised anecdotal evidence and journalistic comment. Few studies have specifically examined the effectiveness of drug testing programs in deterring or reduc- ing drug use among school students and none has been conducted\nLimitations\nSurveillance alone is inadequate unless accompanied by\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Social consensus about what defines deviant behaviour.\nDrug testing will reduce drug use only if young people believe they will experience stigma or negative consequences of their drug use if discovered. Individuals with pro-drug attitudes and little respect for societal norms are less likely to reduce drug use and may view a positive drug test as status. \xe2\x80\xa2 Capacity to apply negative sanctions or punishment.\nWithout a negative sanction (e.g., exclusion, punishment from parents), drug testing is unlikely to deter future use. For example, athletes may view exclusion from competition as undesirable, but schoolchildren may welcome exclusion from classes.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Capacity to handle concealment (e.g., masking).\nIndividuals may use masking agents, avoid providing a sample (e.g., absence from school if they\nexpect to be tested), or switch to less detectable, and potentially more harmful, drugs or alcohol.\nTeenage drug use does not lead inevitably to problematic drug use.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 While screening is sensible for health issues that predictably lead to deterioration (e.g., cancers),\nthis is not so for teenage drug use.

Young people may also\nselect their friends on the basis of similar interests, including drug-using behaviour.\nrigorously in a controlled, unbiased manner. Table 2 provides a sum- mary of available studies. The main criterion for inclusion in Table 2 was the use of behavioural measures of drug use as the key outcome variable, and included studies were critically appraised according to levels of evidence (NHMRC, 1999) and criteria for methodological quality (EPOC, 2002). Studies that only focused on attitudes, per- ceptions or beliefs of students, parents and teachers were excluded as such studies say little about the effectiveness of drug testing in deterring actual use.\nAll five studies presented in Table 2 used a self-report cross- sectional survey design, which has inherent limitations such as underestimating levels of use. To illustrate this point, the propor- tion of teenagers self-reporting illicit drug use in the US National Household Survey on Drug Abuse (NHSDA) did not correlate with objective measures, such as the proportion of teenagers in drug overdose deaths or drug-related hospital emergency treatments (Males, 2005).\nOne study in Table 2, widely cited as providing evidence of drug testing effectiveness in deterring use, was conducted at a New Jer- sey high school between 1997 and 2000 (Brady, 2004). More than 500 students were surveyed on three separate occasions (prior to the drug testing program commencing, during the program, and after the program was suspended). Overall, there was a decline in self-reported use when the drug testing program was in place, with a subsequent increase in use when the program was suspended. While these data appear to indicate that drug testing was success- ful in reducing and/or deterring drug use, caution should be applied as the study was limited by lack of comparable control data; failure to control for additional elements to drug testing which included a written drug policy, drug education, student counselling and assis- tance; and no statistical analyses were performed to determine if reductions in use were significant.\nIn a comparison of two schools, one with and one without a drug testing program, McKinney (2004) concluded that the school with drug testing had lower levels of drug-related expulsions and suspensions; lower cannabis use; higher graduation rates; and that students felt safer, were more disapproving of cannabis use; and less likely to use inhalants, tranquillisers or amphetamines com-\n  A.M.

However, the author provided no indication of how comparable the drug testing and non-drug testing schools were with respect to other potential confounding characteristics, such as socioeconomic status, ethnic- ity and gender, school size and location\xe2\x80\x94factors known to impact on the prevalence of drug use by school children (Hawkins et al., 2002; Masten, 2004; Spooner, Hall, & Lynskey, 2001; Wilkinson & Marmot, 2003).\nA post hoc survey of nine US schools which used drug test- ing (DuPont, Campbell, & Mazza, 2002) revealed only limited data pertaining to the effectiveness of drug testing in deterring use. None of the schools conducted formal evaluations, yet reduc- tions in the number of positive tests for a variety of substances were reported. Since the survey results only included schools that described their programs as \xe2\x80\x9csuccessful\xe2\x80\x9d it is not surprising that the authors concluded that drug testing programs were success- ful. No control schools were included in the survey to determine whether other components of the program (e.g., drug education, parental/community support) contributed to reduce drug use. For example, evidence from a survey of school students in Victoria (Australia) and Washington (US) showed significant associations between strong abstinence or harm minimisation drug educa- tion messages (without drug testing programs) and reduced drug or alcohol use (Evans-Whipp, Bond, Toumbourou, & Catalano, 2007).\nStudent athletes in two Oregon high schools, one with and one without a drug testing program, were surveyed at the beginning and end of the school year (Goldberg et al., 2003). Results indi- cated the proportion of student athletes reporting illicit drug use in the 30 days prior to testing decreased in the drug testing school, whereas 30-day use for control athletes (without a drug testing program) increased significantly (p < 0.05). While drug testing may have reduced reported use of illicit drugs in student athletes in the school conducting drug testing, risk factors for drug use, includ- ing norms of use, belief in lower risk of drugs and poorer attitudes towards school increased significantly in the same group (p < 0.05).\nFurther to these issues, Goldberg et al.\xe2\x80\x99s (2003) study con- tained ethical and methodological limitations including punitive outcomes for students who refused to participate in the testing research; a high study dropout rate (>40%); small sample size and self-selection to the intervention group. In addition, students in both schools knew whether they would be tested (or not) at least 3 months before testing began. Thus, baseline data may not be a true indication of pre-intervention drug use.\nIn one of the largest studies, Yamaguchi, Johnston, and O\xe2\x80\x99Malley (2003a; 2003b) examined the association between drug testing and self-reported drug use in over 75,000 Grades 8, 10 and 12 children from 1998 to 2001. Between these years, approximately 18% of all US schools surveyed (74/410 secondary schools) reported implement- ing drug testing (Yamaguchi, Johnston, & O\xe2\x80\x99Malley, 2003c). Results showed that the presence of drug testing was not associated with the prevalence or frequency of cannabis or other illicit drug use in schools (Grades 8, 10 and 12). A follow-up study containing 1 year of additional data in a larger sample of schools confirmed the lack of effect shown in the initial study (Yamaguchi, Johnston, & O\xe2\x80\x99Malley, 2003b).\nHowever, due to the cross-sectional study design of Yamaguchi et al.\xe2\x80\x99s surveys (2003a, 2003b, 2003c), causal effects cannot be determined. A key limitation was that the surveys failed to dis- tinguish between schools that conducted regular random tests and those that tested only occasionally. In addition, it was unclear how well the testing program had been implemented (e.g., appropriate collection of materials, adequate supervision of tests, and strategies to minimise opportunities for cheating).\nIn summary, evaluations of school drug testing programs show poor evidence of effectiveness in deterring use and are based on\nmethodologically flawed research, with a high likelihood of bias leading to an overestimation of any positive effect. Currently, there are no empirical effectiveness data from independent, unbiased and rigorous studies on which to base a case to support drug testing in schools. That is, there is insufficient evidence to indicate that drug detection programs deter the initiation of, or encourage cessation of, drug use in school children.\nThe accuracy of drug testing in detecting drug use\nBeyond the question of whether drug testing achieves its prin- cipal goal of deterring use, there is also a range of important considerations regarding the accuracy of the actual testing tech- niques used. There are four main drug testing strategies that can be utilised to detect drug use among school-aged children: (1) testing the entire school population on a periodic basis, (2) testing spe- cific groups, such students aged 16\xe2\x80\x9318 years old who have been identified as being at greater risk of drug-related harm (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2005), (3) random testing of a predetermined proportion of the total school population, and (4) testing for cause when there is physical or other evidence of drug use. Each of these strategies raises specific issues concerning detec- tion accuracy. For example, testing the whole school population may be the most effective method of detecting use in the school population, but may not prove cost-effective and may result in an unpleasant experience for large numbers of non-drug using students. Similarly, testing for cause may exclude a significant pro- portion of drug using students who do not exhibit any signs of drug use.\nDrug testing is a two-stage process. The first stage is an initial screen of a biological specimen to detect the presence of a drug. Biological specimens can be urine, saliva, hair and sweat; how- ever, urine and saliva are most commonly used. The advantages and disadvantages of testing using different biological specimens are outlined elsewhere (Roche et al., 2008). The initial screen is then followed by a confirmatory test to assess (confirm) the accuracy of any initial positive results from the screening test. Consistent with Australian standards, initial positive screens must be confirmed by a validated analytical procedure using mass spectrometry techniques (Standards Australia, 2001, 2006). To carry out this two-stage pro- cess, two methods of drug testing are available (1) on-site analysis using Point of Collection Test (POCT) devices and (2) laboratory analysis.\nAs most POCT devices use immunoassay techniques and are less reliable and accurate than laboratory analysis, they are useful as ini- tial screening tests only. However, laboratory testing can be utilised for both initial screening and confirmatory testing. Apart from this fundamental difference, POCT devices and laboratory testing each have unique advantages and disadvantages as a method for detect- ing drug use among school-aged children (for details see Roche et al., 2008).\nThe implementation of drug testing to detect drug use among school-aged children requires close examination of a range of fac- tors. A key factor is the detection efficacy of the currently available tests. The ability of any test to accurately detect drug use is deter- mined by three criteria: sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of any test can vary greatly and is dependent on various conditions and circumstances. Eval- uations of the effectiveness of various test devices have generally established minimum acceptable levels for different drug testing settings as: \xe2\x89\xa590% sensitivity, \xe2\x89\xa590% specificity, and \xe2\x89\xa595% accuracy (Verstraete & Puddu, 2000).\nConsideration needs to be given to whether these minimum acceptable levels are appropriate for the testing of children in school settings. For instance, a specificity level of 90% that accepts a false positive error rate of 10%, or one in ten, may be unacceptable in the\nschool setting. If tests with a specificity level of 90% are acceptable, mechanisms may need to be in place to deal with the consequences of false positives. Falsely accusing a child of illicit drug use may have serious legal, social and psychological sequelae.\nThe issue of minimum acceptable levels of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy aside, evidence concerning the effectiveness of the most commonly utilised POCT devices (urine and saliva) in detect- ing drug use is mixed. While some studies have concluded that urine and saliva devices are effective (Crouch et al., 2005; Moody, Fang, Andrenyak, Monti, & Jones, 2006; Peace, Tarnai, & Poklis, 2000; Walsh, Flegel, Crouch, Cangianelli, & Baudys, 2003; Walsh et al., 2007), others have cautioned against the use of these devices, particularly in clinical settings (George & Braithwaite, 1995, 2002). Three main issues of concern with POCT devices are (1) wide vari- ability in the accuracy and reliability of different devices (Peace et al., 2000; Verstraete & Puddu, 2000; Walsh et al., 2003), (2) lim- ited ability of saliva POCT devices to detect cannabis use (Crouch et al., 2005; Walsh et al., 2003), and (3) the ease of use and the degree of difficulty in interpreting POCT test results which varies widely between devices (Gronholm & Lillsunde, 2001; Verstraete & Puddu, 2000; Verstraete & Raes, 2006).\nThere is also evidence to indicate that the reliability and accuracy of laboratory analysis can vary between laboratories (Lu & Taylor, 2006; Montagna, Polettini, Stramesi, Groppi, & Vignali, 2002; Riley, Lu, & Taylor, 2000) and according to the methods of analysis utilised by individual laboratories (Baptista et al., 2002; Eichhorst, Etter, Lepage, & Lehotay, 2004). For example, in one US study (Riley et al., 2000), the same 931 urine samples were submitted to two indepen- dent laboratories for analysis. Of these samples, a total of 52 (5.6%) resulted in a different analysis outcome from the two laboratories. Thirty-eight were found to be positive at the first laboratory and negative at the second. Fourteen were found to be negative at the first laboratory and positive at the second (Riley et al., 2000). The researchers concluded that differential results between the two lab- oratories might have largely been due to differences in procedural and operational factors.\nA more recent US study identified that a significant proportion of tests within the same laboratory can be susceptible to misinter- pretation (Levy, Sherritt, Vaughan, Germak, & Knight, 2007). Levy et al. examined 710 urinalysis results obtained from 110 adoles- cent patients in a hospital substance abuse program and found re-analysis indicated 40 samples originally classified as negative were too dilute to accurately interpret (i.e., they may have been adulterated) and 45 tests originally classified as positive for illicit drug use were due to the licit use of prescribed medication (Levy et al., 2007). This is an error rate of 12%.\nIn summary, available research indicates that drug testing can detect drug use. However, for POCT devices the risk of false pos- itives is relatively high depending on the type of device used, the target drug, and the expertise of the person conducting the test. This risk is reduced, but not eliminated, by laboratory con- firmation of positive POCT tests. The acceptability of this risk needs to be assessed against the consequences of a school- aged child being falsely accused of using illicit drugs. These may include the child being incorrectly labelled a \xe2\x80\x98drug user\xe2\x80\x99, ostracised by their peers, experiencing decreased self-esteem, or it may result in a negative impact on student\xe2\x80\x93teacher or child\xe2\x80\x93parent relationships.\nNegative outcomes associated with school drug testing\nExisting research concerning the effectiveness of testing has focused primarily on measuring reductions in the number of positive drug tests or self-reported drug use. Few studies evalu- ating the effectiveness of drug testing have measured changes in other outcomes that may be impacted by drug use, or potentially\nadverse effects of implementing a drug testing program. Only one qualitative study was identified that specifically assessed the broader impact of drug testing in schools. Coombs and Coombs (1991) examined the impact of drug testing on students\xe2\x80\x99 morale and psychological well-being after the introduction of mandatory drug testing of American college athletes. Data collected from 500 survey questionnaires and 57 in-depth interviews showed that most athletes (71.4%) were untroubled by the drug testing experience, with some reporting other benefits, such as increased awareness and knowledge about drug harms, or changes in drug- associated behaviour. The remainder, however, found it stressful, embarrassing, humiliating or upsetting. Some feared they might be wrongly identified and disqualified from competition for using cold or asthma medication or other over-the-counter medicines; others felt degraded and humiliated by the experience, or offended by implied suspicion. For some, the prospect of drug testing led them to change the times or types of drugs they consumed to avoid detec- tion, rather than reduce overall use. Drug testing in schools may also foster a culture of resistance where students take pride in beat- ing the test or boast about testing positive. The Internet provides readily available information about how to mask drug use to avoid detection.\nSimilarly, several negative outcomes which are risk factors for increased substance use were associated with the drug testing program implemented in Goldberg et al.\xe2\x80\x99s study (2003) (Table 2). Compared with their peers in the control school, student athletes in the drug testing school believed that random drug testing pro- vided fewer benefits; there were fewer negative consequences of random drug testing; that authority figures were more tolerant of drug use; had greater preference for risky drug use behaviour; and had poorer attitudes towards the school.\nIn a national consultation of 1700 Catholic secondary schools in Australia, the Jesuit Social Services examined how schools responded to incidents of illicit drug use by students (Norden, 2005). The Keeping Them Connected report concluded that, rather than reducing drug use by students, random drug testing, which was implemented in a number of schools, forced the problem underground, reflected a breakdown in trust and communication and made it harder for schools to handle. The messages received by students in drug testing schools were reported as \xe2\x80\x98don\xe2\x80\x99t allow your continuing drug behaviour to be detected by school authori- ties; and if you or another student has problems in relation to illicit drug use, don\xe2\x80\x99t approach school authorities for assistance\xe2\x80\x99 (Norden, 2005, p. 7). Thus, \xe2\x80\x98the approach was seen to be effective in protecting the school\xe2\x80\x99s reputation as being \xe2\x80\x9ctough on drugs\xe2\x80\x9d, but questionable with respect to the school\xe2\x80\x99s duty of care for the student concerned\xe2\x80\x99 (Norden, 2005, p. 7).\nDespite drug testing in American schools being variously described by advocates as proactive, preventive and non-punitive, disciplinary measures often follow a positive school drug test. This may be premised on the idea that for a random drug testing regime to be efficacious it \xe2\x80\x98would have to contain some additional element of punishment\xe2\x80\x99 (McKeganey, 2005, p. 5). Schools with drug testing programs have adopted a variety of policies, which often include a range of sanctions, in the event of a student returning a posi- tive drug test result. Sanctions may range from a \xe2\x80\x98zero tolerance\xe2\x80\x99 policy, with exclusion from extracurricular activities, suspension or expulsion from school, to a non-punitive response, with educa- tion, counselling and support for students. The former may prove counterproductive.\nOut-of-school suspensions and expulsions give rise to another set of problems for students, schools and parents, namely safety concerns related to lack of professional support and adult supervision during the suspension period and discontinuity of education (Taras, 2003). For example, poor academic achiev- ers are over-represented among substance users (Cox, Zhang,\nA.M. Roche et al. / International Journal of Drug Policy 20 (2009) 521\xe2\x80\x93528 525\n526 A.M. Roche et al. / International Journal of Drug Policy 20 (2009) 521\xe2\x80\x93528\nJohnson, & Bender, 2007; Roche et al., 2008) as are socially and economically disadvantaged students (Wilkinson & Marmot, 2003).\nIronically, students who are most likely to be suspended or expelled are also most in need of adult supervision. Suspension or expulsion from school may exacerbate existing academic and learning difficulties, provide more opportunity to engage in risky or criminal activities, and predispose to greater risk of substance use or to quit school permanently (Taras, 2003). Humiliation and alien- ation of vulnerable students in an environment of mistrust may inadvertently potentiate risks to students\xe2\x80\x99 long-term psychological well-being.\nA number of potentially deleterious outcomes from implement- ing school drug testing programs have been identified. They include a breakdown in the parent\xe2\x80\x93child and/or school\xe2\x80\x93child relation- ship (Kern et al., 2006); increased school exclusions and truancies; reduced participation in extracurricular activities, which may result in pursuit of more risky behaviours; diversion to other substances that are not tested, or less detectable, yet potentially more harm- ful, including alcohol, inhalants, ecstasy (Knight & Mears, 2007); unwarranted invasion of privacy; breach of confidentiality as stu- dents must declare the use of prescription or over-the-counter medications; false sense of a drug-free environment (children with serious drug problems may still have negative test results if their drug use is outside the window of detection, or have used mask- ing agents or other evasion techniques); lack of developmentally appropriate treatment/interventions after testing positive (Knight & Mears, 2007); school time and resources being used on drug test- ing rather than education; ambiguous role for schools as monitors of students\xe2\x80\x99 drug use; and the imposition of penalties for drug use that may have a long-term impact on the education and welfare of school-aged students.\nTable 3\nKey differences between American and Australian legal and ethical frameworks.\nEthical and legal issues\nTo date, drug testing of school children has been employed as a prevention strategy in some schools within the US. Australia\xe2\x80\x99s legal framework, however, differs markedly from that of the United States in a number of important respects. Table 3 contrasts the US experience of the legal and ethical issues with the Australian legal framework. Comparison of the Australian and American legal per- spectives is relevant as the American experience is often presented to support the implementation of similar processes.\nCurrently, Australia lacks specific legislation that addresses school drug testing and the legal status of the issue is undeter- mined and must be adjudged by either the principles of contract law (in the case of non-government schools) or through reference to common law standards. However, given that government schools derive their duties from State education legislation, any govern- ment school seeking to implement drug testing would need to ensure that the policy reflected the relevant State legislation.\nFour main common law and ethical issues relevant to school drug testing are (1) Duty of care: explored through an examination of the standard of care expected from Australian schools; (2) Right to bodily inviolability: considered through looking at the quality and nature of issues such as privacy, consent and necessity; (3) Drug testing as a deterrence strategy; and (4) Rights of the child: as deter- mined with reference to Australian legislation and the ratification of International Treaties.\nA central issue in drug testing, and a key area where there is a significant difference between Australia and the US, is in relation to the rights of the child. The US Supreme Court has determined that children were less entitled to the full \xe2\x80\x98bundle of rights\xe2\x80\x99 enjoyed by adults (Board of Education of Independent Schools Dist.No.92 of Pottawatomie City v Earls, 2002). Thus, US school children are\nAustralia\nDuty of care in Australia is considerably more limited. The duty of care of an Australian school:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Does not extend to cover activities outside of school hours Commonwealth v Introvigne (1982), and;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Would be expected to acknowledge the child\xe2\x80\x99s right to privacy.\nThus, it is unlikely that drug testing would be needed or justified as part of the school\xe2\x80\x99s duty of care.\nAustralia recognises that children are entitled to the full bundle of rights provided by the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CROC). These rights extend to medical testing (such as drug testing) and include:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Respect for individual autonomy, informed decision making and protection for those with diminished autonomy (e.g., children and the disabled).\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Justice to ensure fairness in distributing benefits and avoiding detriment to vulnerable groups.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Beneficence to maximise benefits and minimise harms (Australian Law Reform Commission, 2003).\nPreventive health care is deemed non-therapeutic.\nAs such, voluntary consent would be required for drug testing. Failure to offer consent would be unlikely to be deemed an admission of guilt within the current Australian legal framework (Department of Health and Community Services v JWB and SMB, 1922; Perkins v Golden Plains Fodder Australia/Macpri Pty Ltd., 2004).\nAustralia has acknowledged that children are in special need of protection from the state through ratification of the international treaty\xe2\x80\x94Convention on the Rights of the Child (CROC) (Convention on the Rights of the Child, 1991).\n Issue\nDuty of care\nRight to bodily inviolability\nDrug testing as a deterrence strategy\nRights of the child\nUSA\nThe US judiciary have stated that US schools have an in loco parentis role (New Jersey v TLO, 1985), meaning that the school has the legal responsibility to take on some of the functions and responsibilities of a parent. This responsibility can extend to drug testing.\nDrug testing is analogous to medical examinations (Vernonia School District 47J v Acton et al., 1995). Children are less entitled to the full \xe2\x80\x98bundle of rights\xe2\x80\x99 enjoyed by adults (Board of Education of Independent Schools Dist.No.92 of Pottawatomie City v Earls, 2002).\nReasonableness of drug testing determined according to what a \xe2\x80\x98reasonable\xe2\x80\x99 parent may do.\nSince drug use in young people was considered \xe2\x80\x98epidemic\xe2\x80\x99, individual and parental consent was not needed (Board of Education of Independent Schools Dist.No.92 of Pottawatomie City v Earls, 2002).\nThe status position of the child within the US has led to the determination that children are less entitled to freedom from interference of the State provided to adults by the US Bill of Rights (Board of Education of Independent Schools Dist.No.92 of Pottawatomie City v Earls, 2002).\nless entitled to freedom from interference of the State provided to adults by the US Bill of Rights. Australian law interprets the rights of the child quite differently. While the Australian Constitution does not contain any express rights similar to the US Bill of Rights, rights of children are recognised within Australian law through Australia\xe2\x80\x99s ratification of The Convention on the Rights of the Child (CROC) as well as in the Family Law Act 1975. Article 16 of CROC provides that:\n. . .no child shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interfer- ence with his or her privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his or her honor or reputation (Convention on the Rights of the Child, 1991).\nWhile Article 16 of the CROC refers generally to information privacy, it has also been interpreted to cover physical privacy (Australian Law Reform Commission, 2006). In addition, the \xe2\x80\x98best interests of the child\xe2\x80\x99 test is enacted in the Family Law Act, 1975. This test has been assessed as paramount in that the \xe2\x80\x98protection of the child should be elevated above all other interests, although those other interests are not completely disregarded\xe2\x80\x99 (Minister for Health v AS & Anor, 2004).\nIn summary, the Australian legal framework differs from the US. In particular, Australia places great(er) weight on the rights of the child than does US law and affords the child greater rights to privacy and protection from interference especially where it may negatively impact their reputation. Australian law is more sensitive to the lack of avenues for redress and natural justice available to children (Australian Law Reform Commission, 1997). Drug testing, without cause, may be viewed as a threat to these rights.\nThe legal status of drug testing in Australian workplaces\nWhile there have been no legal challenges or judgments con- cerning school drug testing in the Australian context to-date, a number of legal precedents have been set concerning drug test- ing in Australian workplaces. The Australian Industrial Relations Commission recognises workplace drug testing as one of a num- ber of responses available to employers. Implementation requires a consensus position to be achieved via extensive consultation with employees, management and unions. Even then, drug test- ing is considered \xe2\x80\x98reasonable\xe2\x80\x99 only where specific workplaces are deemed safety-sensitive or special needs settings. Commission- ers\xe2\x80\x99 assessment of reasonableness also included the review periods as well as the period that the confidential information could be held by the employer. Zero tolerance random drug testing, in the absence of strong justification, has been judged to be unreasonable in the Australian workplace (e.g., Perkins v Golden Plains Fodder Australia/Macpri Pty Ltd., 2004).\nA primary difference exists between a workplace and a school environment. Employment is reflective of a contractual relationship while a student\xe2\x80\x99s requirement to attend school is a status rela- tionship. Accordingly, issues related to collective negotiation and consent is substantially different within a workplace compared to a school environment. The relationship of children to school teach- ers is different to that of employees to employers. Finally, school environments often lack the avenues of redress and natural justice that are present within many workplaces.\nConclusion\nThe evidence reviewed indicates that caution should be applied when considering the use of drug testing in the school setting. Overall, we found little support for the efficacy of school drug testing in deterring use and major limitations in regard to the accuracy of drug testing techniques. Moreover, potentially delete-\nrious outcomes from implementing school drug testing programs were identified and important ethical and legal concerns were raised.\nWhile our review found little support for drug testing, there is considerable scope for the school to act as an agent for the prevention of drug use and its associated problems and there is accumulating evidence of preventive strategies that are likely to be effective in the school setting (Faggiano et al., 2005; Foxcroft, Ireland, Lister-Sharp, Lowe, & Breen, 2002; Thomas & Perera, 2006). One approach that has gained considerable currency in recent years focuses on the school\xe2\x80\x99s role as an institution of socialisation. Such approaches are designed to enhance students\xe2\x80\x99 sense of connected- ness to the school, which in turn acts as a strong moderator of a range of risk factors including drug use (Bond et al., 2004; Durlak et al., 2007; Resnick et al., 1997; Tobler & Stratton, 1997). School- based drug prevention strategies can also involve the families of students and/or strategies that target high-risk students. Some of the strongest supporting evidence for effective drug preven- tion programs comes from programs which involve families (Allen, Coombes, & Foxcroft, 2006; Foxcroft et al., 2002; Spoth, Redmond, & Shin, 2001), while strategies such as motivational interviewing and brief interventions have also been shown to be effective for adolescent drug users (Tait & Hulse, 2003; Tevyaw & Monti, 2004; Winters & Leitten, 2007).\nSchools are one of the most important settings for health pro- motion and preventive interventions among children and youth. However, it appears drug testing has little to offer in this regard.\nReferences\nAllen, D., Coombes, L., & Foxcroft, D. (2006). The role of parents and the community in drug prevention. In R.

These developments raise the issue of trans-institutionalization of patient subgroups, whose particular needs of support are less accommodated by ra- tionalized general psychiatry. While forensic psychiatric aftercare with a focus on risk assessment and assertive treatment has been largely established, preventive care of high-risk psychiatric patients to avert delinquency, compulsory hospitalization, or forensic courses has not yet been developed. Three outpatient studies addressing these issues have been conceptualized independently and were initiated in Germany and Switzerland. All three have similar study endpoints regarding incidence of violence, delinquency, compulsory hospitalization, and forensific sequelae. However, designs and methods differ with regard to inclusion criteria, assessment methods, foci of interventions, modes of delivering care, degrees of assertiveness, and times of follow-up. By the time of study completions, it can be expected that the joined information from all three studies will allow for a compre- hensive appraisal of preventive treatment strategies and approaches in high-risk patients. In this paper, the study designs and methods of the three trials are outlined.\n\xc2\xa9 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n     1.

Introduction\nOver the past 40 years, reforms in general psychiatry have induced marked deinstitutionalization in favor of social and community-based psychiatric care in many countries (Kramp & Gabrielsen, 2009). Addi- tionally, rationalizations in hospital services have led to reductions of hospital beds and lengths of stay (Doenisch-Seidel et al., 2007; Schanda, Stompe, & Ortwein-Swoboda, 2010) At the same time, there is an appar- ent tendency of a subgroup of severely ill psychiatric patients to be discharged into the community despite persistently high symptom load, low levels of social functioning, and proneness to violence (Hodgins, Mueller-Isberner, & Allaire, 2006; Schanda et al., 2010). These developments coincide with a continuous rise of detention cases and times in forensic psychiatric institutions (Schanda et al., 2010). While the interrelation of opposing general and forensic psychi- atric developments is likely to be multidimensional, possibly involving independent, e.g., justiciable factors (Schanda et al., 2010), the critical issue of trans-institutionalization has been raised (Habermeyer, Wolff, Gillner, Strohm, & Kutscher, 2010). A subgroup of severely mentally ill patients, among them schizophrenia patients with complex problems reaching from treatment resistance to noncompliance and comorbidi- ties, does not seem to be sufficiently reached by general-psychiatric services. As a consequence, these patients tend to enter unfavorable courses of illness and are, thus, more prone to precarity and delinquency (Kutscher, Schiffer, & Seifert, 2009). They carry an increased risk of be- coming forensic cases or, prior to that, become the subject of involun- tary hospitalizations in general psychiatry. Being hospitalized against their will bears the risk of further worsening these patients' attitudes to treatment and psychiatric services in general. It may lead to a delete- rious circle of treatment discontinuation and involuntary readmission (Jaeger et al., 2013).\nTo counteract such developments, and to better reach the severely mentally ill in the community, intensified ways of delivering social and psychiatric care have been initiated. On the one hand, there are treatment approaches on a voluntary basis, such as intensive case man- agement (ICM; Dieterich, Irving, Park, & Marshall, 2011) and assertive community treatment regimes (ACT; Lambert et al., 2010; Brugha et al., 2012). On the other hand, there are compulsory outpatient com- mitments that are issued by legal orders at the point of discharge from involuntary hospital treatment (Burns et al., 2013; Steadman et al., 2001; Swartz et al., 2001). Dieterich et al. concluded in their meta- analysis of 24 trials that ICM, comprising small caseloads and high in- tensity therapeutic input, reduced hospitalization and increased reten- tion in care of the severely mentally ill, when compared to standard community care. ICM was, however, not associated with a change in contacts with the legal system. Interestingly, the more ICM was adher- ent to the ACT model, the better it was at decreasing time in hospital. According to Lambert et al. key features of ACT are a multidisciplinary team approach with a small client/staff ratio, high-frequent treatment contacts with 60\xe2\x80\x9370% of interventions provided in the community\nsetting, a \xe2\x80\x9cno drop-out policy\xe2\x80\x9d, and a 24 h a day availability including crisis intervention. When using this regime in patients with schizophre- nia spectrum disorders, they found that ACT, as compared to standard community care, was associated with a reduced rate and time to service disengagement and with larger improvements of symptoms, illness se- verity, global functioning, quality of life, and client satisfaction. Brugha et al. (2012) found in their survey on the outcome of assertive outreach (AO) across England that, under AO, the time spent in hospital de- creased. Furthermore, the effectiveness of joint crisis plans for people with psychosis has been evaluated in several controlled trials. While re- sults clearly suggested improvement of therapeutic relationships, con- flicting results have been reported as to their potential to reduce compulsory hospitalization (Henderson et al., 2004; Papageorgiou, King, Janmohamed, Davidson, & Dawson, 2002; Thornicroft et al., 2013).\nThe outcomes of compulsory outpatient approaches appear less fa- vorable: An outpatient commitment program conducted in New York showed no significant difference of the court-ordered group regarding psychiatric rehospitalization (Steadman et al., 2001). In an outpatient commitment trial conducted in North Carolina, control and outpatient commitment groups also did not differ significantly regarding hospital outcomes. However, it is interesting to note that in patients with psy- choses, outpatient commitment reduced hospital admissions when combined with a higher intensity of outpatient treatment (Swartz et al., 1999, 2001). In a large outpatient commitment study in the State of New York, Phelan et al. (2010) studied different endpoints not only in schizophrenia patients, but also in people with schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, and major depression. They found positive ef- fects of assisted outpatient treatment on several self-reported items, among them serious violent behavior, suicide risk, and social function- ing, and attributed them to the enhanced service package and not to legal coercion per se. However, a very recent comparison of community treatment orders (CTOs) vs. \xe2\x80\x9cleave of absence under Section 17 of the Act\xe2\x80\x9d following involuntary hospitalizations again yielded negative re- sults: Despite more than three-fold increased time spent under commu- nity care in the CTO group vs. the Section 17 group, rates of readmission, time spent in hospital, clinical and social outcomes were unchanged (Burns et al., 2013).\nThe convergence of evidence in the above studies suggests, but does not prove, that intensifying outpatient care delivery to the subgroup of difficult-to-reach severely mentally ill patients may be effective in re- ducing rehospitalization. Evidence appears equivocal between studies regarding the improvement of clinical symptoms, but more concordant for improving social functioning (Lambert et al., 2010; Phelan et al., 2010). Outpatient treatments in this clientele seem to work better if they are voluntary rather than compulsory, and if they include en- hanced service features like multi-professional case-management, home treatment, out of hours services. It is unclear, however, which particular treatment modality or combination is effective, and whether treatment effects apply to the total of the severely mentally ill or to cer- tain subgroups. There is also no firm knowledge, whether the above\noutpatient interventions can avert unfavorable courses of illness and its sequelae, such as precarity, delinquency, violence, and forensic devel- opments. There are some indications that a subgroup of schizophrenia patients with lack of insight into illness, non-compliance, and comor- bidities needs to be specifically addressed with particular regard to their sense of coercion (Jaeger et al., 2013) and an emphasis on psychoeducation (Xia, Merinder, & Begamwar, 2013). Little is known about specific outpatient needs of other diagnostic groups among the difficult-to-reach severely mentally ill.\nFacing the paucity of evidence, three research groups in Germany and Switzerland started independent prospective community treat- ment programs with different designs and interventions for difficult- to-reach and high-risk-of-violence psychiatric subjects. Their common denominator is the study of intensified and specified outpatient care de- livery as to its feasibility and possible effects on diverse endpoints, such as rates of hospitalization, violence, delinquency, clinical symptoms and social functions. All studies have been rolled-out and are currently on- going. In the following the studies will be delineated as to their corre- sponding settings, designs, and methods (Table 1).\n2. Delineation of ongoing studies\n2.1. Psychoeducational intervention program to reduce compulsory hospital readmission in the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland\n2.1.1. Background\nIn Switzerland high numbers of involuntary placement of people with mental disorders have been reported in comparison to other European countries (Salize & Dressing, 2004) which constitute a major public health issue. In the Canton of Zurich, a catchment area of 1.4 mil- lion inhabitants, the annual quotas of involuntary admissions amount to some 25% of all psychiatric inpatient admissions (Lay, Nordt, & Ro\xcc\x88ssler, 2011). In light of the ethical, health care organizational, and political rel- evance of this problem, the need for innovative interventions to im- prove the current situation has frequently been advocated. Various efforts have been directed to integrate mentally disordered patients into the complex system of mental health services: These efforts range from empowerment (Henderson et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2007; Papageorgiou et al., 2002) to psycho-education (Ba\xcc\x88uml et al., 2007; Krischke, 2006) or preventive measures targeting the \xe2\x80\x9ccontinuity of care\xe2\x80\x9d. These approaches are considered promising and helpful in en- hancing compliance with psychiatric treatment programs, thus possibly reducing involuntary inpatient episodes, costs and transfers of patients to the criminal justice system. However, there has been only scarce evidence of the effectiveness of such efforts in terms of more robust outcome criteria (e.g., significant reduction of admission rates, cost- effectiveness).\n2.1.2. Aims\nThe current study aims to analyze the effectiveness of an innovative intervention program for patients at high risk of compulsory admission to psychiatric hospitals. This intervention program targets the reduction of the number of compulsory hospitalizations (primary outcome criteri- on). Moreover, it intends to reduce the degree of patients' perceived co- ercion and to increase patients' empowerment, social role functioning, and quality of life (secondary outcome criteria).\n2.1.3. Type of study\nThis intervention program is implemented as a sub-project within the framework of the Zurich Programme for Sustainable Development of Mental Health Services (ZInEP). The study is currently conducted at four psychiatric hospitals mandated to provide psychiatric care to adult patients in the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland. In a prospective con- trolled trial of 118 patients each has been assigned to the intervention group or to the control group. Control modality participants receive treatment as usual.\n2.1.4. Type of intervention\nThe intervention program and the design of the study are described in detail elsewhere (Lay et al., 2012). In brief, the intervention program consists of: (a) individualized psycho-education (1\xe2\x80\x933 instruction ses- sions) focusing on behaviors prior to and during an illness related crisis, (b) the distribution of an individualized crisis card and, after discharge from psychiatry, (c) a 24-month preventive monitoring.\nDuring the monitoring, each patient is contacted every fourth week by telephone. At each contact, the present status of the study participant is assessed using an individual checklist covering risk factors of relapse (e.g., familial, work, or financial problems), information on treatment- related behavior and mental health service use as well as personal and social resources. All interventions are provided by a personal mental health care worker (psychologist) who maintains the contact to the study participant over the course of the whole study.\nThis program primarily addresses the self-management skills of chronically mentally ill patients. It is designed as a supplementary inter- vention (supplementary to patients' regular therapy) to give chronically mentally ill patients individual support to become more actively in- volved in their care. Preventive monitoring enables detection of early signs of a crisis or of a threatening relapse. It offers opportunities to refer to the patients' individual crisis card and to ways of optimized ser- vice use in case of a relapse.\n2.1.5. Study subjects\nThe study sample was recruited from a naturalistic user sample of inpatient mental health care in the four study centers. Included are pa- tients who have been compulsorily admitted to psychiatry at least once during the past 24 months, aged 18\xe2\x80\x9365 years, residing in the Canton of Zurich and able and willing to consent. Participation is not limited to a specific mental disorder. To be included in the study, patients must not have been diagnosed with an ICD-10 F0, F5, or F7\xe2\x80\x93F9 diagnosis. Moreover, individuals who cannot be contacted by telephone were not eligible for inclusion.\n2.1.6. Assessments\nDetailed assessments are made in all study subjects at the point of discharge from index hospital stay (baseline), and at 12 and 24 months after baseline. Data are gathered by means of structured face-to-face in- terviews and standardized questionnaires. Assessments include clinical data (psychopathology BPRS; Lukoff, Nuechterlein, & Ventura, 1986, CGI, GAF), risk of self-harm or threat to others (HCR-20; Webster, Douglas, Eaves, & Hart, 1997, PCL-SV; Hart, Cox, & Hare, 1995), as well as data on sociodemographics and service use (voluntary and involun- tary inpatient episodes, prison terms, use of outpatient psychiatric care or other services during follow-up; CSSRI-EU; Chisolm et al., 2000). Fur- thermore, several constructs of patients' subjective perceptions are assessed: perceived coercion (MacArthur AES; Lidz et al., 1995), empow- erment (Empowerment-Scale; Rogers, Chamberlin, Ellison, & Crean, 1997), treatment satisfaction (CSQ-8; Attkisson & Zwick, 1982), quality of life (WHO-Qol-Bref; Angermeyer, Kilian, & Matschinger, 2000), social support (BSSS; Schulz & Schwarzer, 2003), and stigma of mental illness.\n2.1.7. Data analysis\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention program, all major endpoints of the study will be compared between the intervention and the control group. Primary outcome of the study is the time in hos- pital accumulated over all involuntary inpatient stays during the 24 month period. This outcome criterion will be analyzed in terms of both, \xe2\x80\x98time in hospital\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98health care costs\xe2\x80\x99. As further endpoints of the study, changes in the perspective of the patients (secondary out- come criteria) will be compared.\nMoreover the study seeks to identify individual and social factors that influence primary and secondary outcomes. Characteristics on the patient level (such as treatment history, diagnosis, social network) will be used to analyze a possible association with the major endpoints.\nC.

Preventive Forensic Assertive Community Care of the District Hospital of Ansbach (PFACTA), State of Bavaria, Germany\n2.2.1. Background\nThe project is set in the catchment area of the District Hospital of Ansbach (approx. 200,000 inhabitants aged over 18 years). It addresses all persons with a high risk of violence and a primary psychiatric diagno- sis of incipient or fully developed schizophrenia, personality disorder, or paraphilia. According to the literature, prevalence rates of schizophrenia, personality disorders, and paraphilias amount to about 1% each. In schizophrenic patients, it is estimated that approximately 3\xe2\x80\x935% have an illness-related increased risk profile to commit a crime of violence (Nitschke, Osterheider, & Mokros, 2011; Swanson, Holzer, Ganju, & Jono, 1990). Consequently, for the District of Ansbach, a one-year preva- lence of approximately 60\xe2\x80\x93100 persons who are suffering from psychotic illness and in need of preventive treatment can be estimated. Regarding personality disordered and paraphilic patients, there is a paucity of scien- tific knowledge as to their proportion among an illness-related high-risk group for criminal violence. It is assumed that, compared to schizophre- nia, their proportion is much lower, amounting to a one-year prevalence of about 20 persons in the catchment area. Hence, there is a need for 80\xe2\x80\x93 120 persons to be treated in the Preventive Forensic Preventive Outpa- tient Clinic of the District Hospital of Ansbach (PFACTA).\n2.2.2. Aims\nBy offering a low threshold for forensic risk profiling and, if needed, a multi-disciplinary outreaching support, treatment and monitoring pro- gram, it is sought to reach patients' acceptance, motivation and insight into a treatment need by the PFACTA. By pre\xe2\x80\x93post intervention compar- isons the effectiveness of this specialized support initiative is to be judged in relation to the development of the forensic risk profile, overt incidents of delinquency, patients' psychopathological and functional states and family conditions.\n2.2.3. Type of study\nThe prospective intervention trial is designed to consecutively in- clude 80\xe2\x80\x93120 high-risk-of-violence psychiatric patients from a natural- istic community setting. This is realized by a widespread mode of entry into the screening process of the study, allowing for self-referrals as well as referrals by general practitioners or clinicians. A matched control sample is recruited in a regular general-psychiatric outpatient setting of a different catchment area (Erlangen District Hospital).\n2.2.4. Type of intervention\nThe intervention is delivered both by home visits and outpatient ap- pointments at the Ansbach District Hospital. Besides the communica- tion of the assessed forensic risk profile to the patient, treatment options include psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, and manualized group therapies (e.g., Reasoning and Rehabilitation (R&R), Treatment Program for Sexual Offenders R + R, Sex Offender Treatment Program (SOTP)) by a multi-professional team. A no-drop-out policy is imple- mented, and mobile telecommunications (calls, text messages) are used to increase adherence and compliance.\n2.2.5. Study subjects\nCommunity dwelling subjects aged 18 years or older are legitimate for study inclusion, if forensic risk profiling constitutes an increased risk of violence related to psychiatric illness, and if they are either judged pre-psychotic or diagnosed with schizophrenia, severe personal- ity disorder or paraphilia. Risk profiling is done by structural clinical judgment mainly aided by the use of HCR-20. Patients who are judged as of medium or high risk for future violent behavior are included. Pri- mary diagnoses of substance dependence or intellectual disability are among the exclusion criteria. The recruitment of patients is done in close collaboration with the Department of General Psychiatry, District Hospital of Ansbach, psychiatrists in private practice, and general\npractitioners in the catchment area of the District Hospital in Ansbach. Furthermore the patient himself and/or his family have also the oppor- tunity to contact the PFACTA directly. The public, clinicians, and the tar- get group are informed about the intervention program by presenting events, brochures, a website, and the media. The information empha- sizes that the program is not compulsory, but an extended offer of support.\n2.2.6. Assessments\nAssessments are taken at the time point of screening/study inclusion during and at the end of intervention and comprise forensic risk profil- ing, testing of neuropsychological performance and personality, stan- dardized ratings of psychopathology (e.g., PANSS (Kay, Fiszbein, & Opler, 1987), Symptom Checklist-90, SCL-90-R (Franke, 2002) and fo- rensic risk (e.g., PCL-R (Hare, 1991), HCR-20 (Webster et al., 1997)), level of aggression, assessments of adherence, activities of daily living, home situation, rates of criminal charges, and offenses.\n2.2.7. Data analysis\nTo evaluate the effect of the intervention program, a pre\xe2\x80\x93post-treat- ment comparison will be made regarding all major endpoints of the study. The primary outcome measure is the comparison of the level of aggression, the risk profile, and future charges for violent behavior be- tween the treatment and control groups. Moreover, the rates of adher- ence, readmissions, and the patients' activities of daily living will be compared.\n2.3. Complex-therapeutic outpatient intervention for preventing endangering behavior in psychotic patients in the city of Du\xcc\x88sseldorf, State of North-Rhine- Westphalia, Germany\n2.3.1. Background\nThe PsychPrev study is conducted in the Section of General Psychi- atry at the University Hospital of Du\xcc\x88sseldorf. Its setting is community- based, as the hospital subserves a large urban catchment area, and all consecutive cases of civil commitments in General Psychiatry are screened for study eligibility. These amount to about 200 confirmed or- ders per year, of which 30% are imposed because of endangerment of others. In 70% of these cases, psychotic disorders of the schizophrenia spectrum or manic psychoses are diagnosed as the underlying psychi- atric condition. The study hypothesis is that these patients are a sub- group at high risk for violence, which is insufficiently reached by standard psychiatric outpatient care and, therefore, in need of a more outreaching, complex-therapeutic approach tailored to specific sub- group problems.\n2.3.2. Aims\nThe objective of the study is to evaluate whether a specified complex-therapeutic outpatient intervention, which is started after a public order placement following an act of endangerment or violence, is feasible and effective with regard to avoiding further involuntary hos- pitalizations (primary outcome), violence, and delinquency.\n2.3.3. Type of study\nThe study is designed as a prospective non-randomized intervention trial. Comparison groups are a matched patient cohort receiving treat- ment as usual at the partner clinic in Cologne and the group of study de- cliners in Du\xcc\x88sseldorf. The study is naturalistic, because all consecutive public order cases of the catchment area in Du\xcc\x88sseldorf are screened for study participation.\n2.3.4. Type of intervention\nThe study intervention is provided for 6 months. It consists of psychi- atric, psychotherapeutic, and social-therapeutic modules adapted to meet specific needs of the patient subgroup. For example, psycho- educational group therapy is adapted to target the topics of comorbid\nC. Luckhaus et al. / Aggression and Violent Behavior 22 (2015) 1\xe2\x80\x938 5\n6 C. Luckhaus et al. / Aggression and Violent Behavior 22 (2015) 1\xe2\x80\x938\naddiction and violence in psychosis. Individualization of treatment is re- alized by treatment modules, such as individualized contingency plans and home visits. Further intervention principles are interlinking case management, patient tracking, a high degree of participative decision making and a no drop-out policy with the exception of patients' explicit withdrawal from the study. Following the intervention phase patients enter treatment as usual and are followed-up for 6 months.\n2.3.5. Study subjects\nPatients are screened for study participation if they are involuntarily hospitalized by public order because of endangerment or a violent act. They are eligible for study inclusion if they have a psychotic disorder as the leading diagnosis. Recruitment block stratifications are done to ensure a large proportion of schizophrenia spectrum disorders and a preponderance of males for comparability with forensic populations. Despite addressing involuntarily hospitalized patients, study participa- tion is fully voluntary, because patients are not asked to decide on par- ticipating until their placement ends. They are then free to choose no treatment, regular outpatient treatment or to be included in the outpa- tient intervention of the study.\n2.3.6. Assessments\nAssessments are made before the intervention phase (t0), immedi- ately after (t1), and 6 months after the intervention (t2). Psychiatric di- agnoses are made according to ICD-10. Psychiatric histories are taken by semi-structured interviews. Aggressive behavior is assessed by taking the forensic history and the Staff-Observation-Aggression-Scale-Revised (SOAS-R, Nijmann et al., 1999). The risk of future violence is rated using the HCR-20, PCL-SV and the Bremen-Risk-Assessment-Scale-for-Gener- al-Psychiatry (BRAS-GP, Von Berg, Haselbeck, Handschuh, & Timm, 2011). Psychopathology is rated by the PANSS (Kay et al., 1987). Social functioning is rated by GAF and CGI (Guy, 1976). Furthermore, a neuro- psychological test-battery inclusive of an IQ-rating is conducted.\n2.3.7. Data analysis\nResearch data are collected before and after the intervention phase as well as at the end of follow-up. The primary outcome is the rate of re- hospitalization in general psychiatry of the intervention group vs. the comparison groups. This information can be reliably derived from rou- tine administrative data. Secondary outcome criteria relate to the clini- cal state and social functioning, treatment utilization and costs as well as to forensically relevant endpoints, such as endangering behavior, acts of violence, delinquency, and forensic detention. In a post-hoc analysis predictors of untoward and forensic courses will be sought.\n3. Discussion\nPersons with severe mental illness are often difficult to reach by out- patient services. Because of their complex mental health and social problems they are at a particularly high risk of unfavorable courses of ill- ness, concomitant involuntary hospital placements and forensic sequel- ae. The time after hospital discharge can be regarded a pivotal period of transition for these patients and often poses a lacuna in service provi- sion because of a lack in aftercare specified to their particular needs and acceptance. Consequently, it has been recommended to develop and test interventions specifically targeting needs for care in this patient group (Puschner et al., 2011). Measures targeting the prevention of in- voluntary hospital placements and forensic sequelae have only rarely been investigated in controlled trials based on larger samples, so far. All three ongoing trials presented here address this issue with a partic- ular focus on subgroups of patients, who have been involuntarily hospi- talized and/or carry a high risk of violence.\nThe psychoeducational intervention program currently conducted in the Canton of Zurich addresses patients with serious mental disorders who have previously experienced compulsory psychiatric hospitaliza- tion. It is supposed that this patient group may have a strong interest\nto participate in such a program in order to avoid further compulsory measures, and this is expected to increase the motivation to participate in the study. The intervention program includes individualized psycho- education and a preventive monitoring after discharge from psychiatric hospital placement. In schizophrenia patients, psychoeducation has been reported to reduce the rate of rehospitalization in the long-term course (Ba\xcc\x88uml et al., 2007). Psychoeducation focused on individual risk factors for crises/relapse accompanied by close monitoring by a per- sonal mental health care worker has also been suggested as a promising approach to prevent involuntary placement (Krischke, 2006). Rather than being confined to schizophrenia patients, the current study in- cludes patients with a wide range of psychiatric disorders. It is hypoth- esized that patients with all kinds of serious mental health problems who have been committed might benefit from such a program. Beyond that, it is hoped to better understand for which patient groups such a program can be used most effectively. An essential element of this pro- gram is the 24-month monitoring by a personal mental health care worker. Long-term commitment is supposed to have beneficial effects, bringing to mind the patient's individual action plan early in case of a crisis and offering the opportunity to motivate him/her to seek or con- tinue treatment. This seems to be crucial, because short-term or singular interventions cannot necessarily ensure that acquired knowledge is ap- plied or reasonable agreements are followed readily in the long term in case of a crisis. The largely negative outcome of the implementation of a joint crisis plan without a further treatment element to ensure continu- ous clinical monitoring (Thornicroft et al., 2013) seems to support this notion. The main aim of the intervention of the Zurich trial is the pre- vention of compulsory re-admission and the reduction of the patients' perceived coercion. The emphasis of the psychoeducational instruction and monitoring is on factors that are subject to the patient's self- management. Direct involvement in the regular therapies or involve- ment of family members are not intended in this program. Compared to other case management programs (e.g., ICM; Dieterich et al., 2011), the monitoring is carried out exclusively by phone in this trial. Albeit a less \xe2\x80\x98narrow\xe2\x80\x99 form of contact, this might accommodate those patients who hold reservations towards home visits by an outpatient mental health professional. The trial at Zurich will allow for a prospective anal- ysis of the effectiveness of this long-term intervention program. For the intervention group, the expected benefit is the prevention of compulso- ry re-admission and an increase in self-management skills. For the health care system, this would imply a reduction of involuntary inpatient episodes and savings of health care costs. Moreover this study will provide insight into processes and factors that contribute to involuntary placement or modify primary and secondary outcomes (e.g., outpatient service use, social network, psychopathology, patient history). After all, it will broaden our understanding of the special needs of difficult-to-reach severely mentally ill patients.\nThe PsychPrev study at Du\xcc\x88sseldorf was conceptualized in view of the critical interface of general and forensic psychiatry regarding preventive management of schizophrenia patients with an increased risk for vio- lence. It is based on the hypothesis that the criterion \xe2\x80\x93 public order placement in general psychiatry for endangering behavior \xe2\x80\x93 denotes a subgroup of schizophrenia patients, that is prone to violent behavior and difficult to reach by standard psychiatric services. At the same time, by means of their public order placement, these patients are in contact with psychiatric services, and there may be a window for a targeted outpatient intervention following the placement. As has been pointed out by Kutscher et al. (2009), it is likely that this subgroup of schizophrenia and psychotic patients is otherwise prone to unfavorable courses of illness, precarity, delinquency and forensic sequelae. It is fur- ther supposed that an outpatient intervention specified for the particu- lar needs of this clientele may reach a higher degree of acceptance and compliance, which may help to overcome a deleterious circle of treat- ment discontinuation and involuntary readmissions (Jaeger et al., 2013). Besides treatment specifications for subgroup needs, acceptable modes of treatment delivery seem to be crucial in these patients with\nan increased sensitivity to the impression of being coerced to treatment (Jaeger et al., 2013). This latter limitation may have a role in the report- ed ineffectiveness of compulsory outpatient treatment approaches (Brugha et al., 2012; Burns et al., 2013). The PsychPrev intervention tries to avoid this limitation by several strategies relating to voluntari- ness, such as participative decisions and treatment individualization. The primary outcome measure \xe2\x80\x93 involuntary rehospitalization in Gen- eral Psychiatry during and up to six months after the intervention \xe2\x80\x93 is a reliably registered routine administrative data and thus robustly ac- cessible in every screened patient. It is also frequent enough to allow for feasible statistical powering. With some limitations, involuntary re- hospitalization in General Psychiatry can be regarded as a more fre- quent surrogate endpoint of rarer forensic outcomes. In the case of significant global treatment effects on the primary and/or secondary outcome measures, regression analyses can be used to estimate the weights of singular treatment models. On an explorative level, less fre- quent outcome variables, such as a forensic course, can be related to possible predictors that were assessed at baseline.\nThe Ansbach study is designed to offer a particularly low threshold, multi-inclusive program for treatment and assistance to psychiatric patients at risk of future violence. Therefore, the study does not only focus on patients who have been under a treatment order, but further- more, on patients who are treated in private practice or who are not receiving any treatment at all. Self-referrals or consultations by relatives are also included. Besides psychiatric and social-worker outreach treat- ment, the core intervention of this study is a formal forensic risk moni- toring and its communication to the patient. The preventive effect of risk assessment as mediated by a better or more suitable treatment for clients is still at question. In a recent multicenter intervention trial in forensic-psychiatric outpatients, risk assessment combined with shared decision-making in subsequent care planning did not result in a preven- tive effect on violent behavior (Troquete et al., 2013). However, as a methodological drawback of the study it was noted that the experimen- tal intervention was introduced in already pre-existing treatment courses, which had lasted 26 months on average. Therefore, the study in- tervention may not have changed preformed ways of interacting and care planning between study managers and clients. Also, major treat- ment effects may already have occurred prior to the study intervention period, thus ameliorating its possible effect size. The Ansbach study will circumvent these methodological difficulties and also enroll a differ- ent clientele (i.e., subjects that are at risk but have not become forensic, and may thus be more amenable to treatment). In these subjects, an in- tervention balanced between the risk\xe2\x80\x93need\xe2\x80\x93responsibility model and the good-lives model (Andrews, Bonta, & Wormith, 2011) may possibly be more effective.\nAll three ongoing studies are population-based, as their screening and recruitment approaches cover natural catchment areas. While the PsychPrev study at Du\xcc\x88sseldorf limits study inclusion to psychotic pa- tients, the trials conducted in Zurich and Ansbach enroll a broader spec- trum of the severely mentally ill inclusive of affective and personality disorders. Depending on the differing in- and exclusion criteria, consent procedures, and demands for study participation, some degrees of se- lection bias can be expected, but potential skewing will be different be- tween studies. By comparing outcomes between studies, questions related to which diagnoses to treat best will be addressable. The three studies also differ regarding their type of intervention. The Zurich study uses psycho-education, an individual crisis card, and long-term monitoring by telephone as a set combination in each patient. The Ansbach study uses an enriched outpatient and outreach treatment program with a particular emphasis on forensic risk profiling, which will make the inclusion of this particular measure appraisable in treating high-risk-of-violence psychiatric patients. The Du\xcc\x88sseldorf study implements a complex-therapeutic approach, which consists of specified treatment modules. This will allow for judging the effect of the complex intervention and, by sub-analyses, of individual treatment modules.\n4. Conclusion\nThree ongoing prospective trials in Germany and Switzerland, which were conceptualized independently, address the issue of optimizing outpatient care for the subgroup of the severely mentally ill with an in- creased risk for violence/delinquency. The studies differ in their designs and methods with regard to included diagnoses, assessment methods, foci of interventions, modes of delivering care, degrees of assertiveness, and times of follow-up. The Du\xcc\x88sseldorf and the Zurich study both assess compulsory readmissions to General Psychiatry as the primary out- come, while the Ansbach study primarily analyzes the future level of ag- gression and violent behavior. It can be expected that the joined information generated by all three studies will help to answer open questions on how to treat which subgroup of the severely mentally ill best with the goal of preventing compulsory measures and forensically relevant courses. Additionally, issues of allocation of treatment re- sources and cost-effectiveness will be addressable.\nReferences\nAndrews, D. A., Bonta, J., & Wormith, J. S. (2011).

Introduction\nSchool is a key context for the social development of adolescents. In general, the social relations that take place in the school are satisfactory and enriching. Students learn to interact and, by overcoming small conflicts, they forge friendships, some of which will last for a lifetime. However, occasionally some students are involved in dynamics of abuse and continued maltreatment (bullying) by their peers, which can have a negative impact on their lives.\nBullying refers to a kind of violence among students characterized by intentional attacks, which may take various forms (physical or verbal assaults, theft, destruction, isolation ...), on a victim by one or more aggressors. These attacks are not isolated but instead continuous over time, and that continuity is facilitated by the victim's inferiority (physical inferiority, or less social or psychological support) compared to the aggressors (Olweus, 1993).\nBullying is an international problem, whose emergence and incidence have been described in a variety of countries (Romera, Del Rey, & Ortega, 2011). These situations of abuse and intimidation not only have a negative impact on the victim or on the general climate of coexistence and learning at school, but also on the aggressor. Recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses of longitudinal studies show that being a bully at school is a significant predictor of aggression (Ttofi, Farrington, & Lo\xcc\x88sel, 2012) and offending (Ttofi, Farrington, Lo\xcc\x88sel, & Loeber, 2011) later in life. Therefore, the prevention and treatment of bullying at school are not only important to optimize students' psychosocial development and learning but also, at the social level, to prevent subsequent criminal behavior.\nIt is essential to determine the risk factors that enable the predic- tion of the onset of bullying in order to facilitate the early identifica- tion of children at risk of becoming bullies in adolescence and to design preventive or intervention strategies against bullying. Any measure in this regard should start with the analysis of the scientific evidence available to date. Some published works have made a sig- nificant contribution to the understanding of the risk factors of performing traditional bullying in the general population of stu- dents, based on a review of the evidence available at the time of their publication. Most of these works are non-systematic reviews (Calderero, Salazar, & Caballo, 2011; Griffin & Gross, 2004; Hong & Espelage, 2012; Powell & Ladd, 2010; Saarento, Garandeau, & Salmivalli, 2014; Salmivalli, 2010; Thornberg, 2011). There are fewer systematic reviews or meta-analyses. Among them, some try to analyze the predictive value of specific risk factors such as so- cioeconomic status (Tippett & Wolke, 2014) or empathy (Van Noorden, Haselager, Cillessen, & Bukowski, 2014). Others have attempted to provide a global perspective, collecting and analyzing evidence referring to a whole set of risk factors (Cook, Williams, Guerra, Kim, & Sadek, 2010; Lopez, Amaral, Ferreira, & Barroso, 2011).\nThe present work aims to join this scarce type of works, offering a systematic and up-to-date review of the evidence available in the last decade (2005\xe2\x80\x932014). Unlike the reviews of Cook et al. (2010) and Lopez et al. (2011), in which publications on predictors of bul- lying perpetration, bullying victimization, and bully\xe2\x80\x93victim both in childhood and adolescence are discussed, this work will be limited\n.. ................................. 134 .. ................................. 134 .. ................................. 134 .. ................................. 135\nto the analysis of the predictors of bullying perpetration in adoles- cence. We thereby hope to extend the specific evidence concerning it, which will allow us to describe a greater wealth of predictor var- iables and identify coincidences and inconsistencies in the available evidence. We also expect to be more accurate about the type of stu- dents to whom the conclusions can be generalized. This work has the goal of performing a systematic review of the scientific empiri- cal articles published in the last decade that have analyzed possible risk factors predicting traditional school bullying in adolescence.\n2. Method\n2.1. Procedure\nThe process of selection of the articles that were finally analyzed in this review is synthesized in Fig. 1. On December 12, 2014, we consulted the publication databases PsycInfo, Eric, and Web of Science. In PsycInfo and Eric, using as search terms \xe2\x80\x9cBully*\xe2\x80\x9d in \xe2\x80\x9cAny field\xe2\x80\x9d AND \xe2\x80\x9c(Adolescen* OR Secondary)\xe2\x80\x9d in \xe2\x80\x9cAny field\xe2\x80\x9d AND \xe2\x80\x9c(Risk factor* OR Predictor*)\xe2\x80\x9d in \xe2\x80\x9cAny field\xe2\x80\x9d, limiting the results to \xe2\x80\x9cAssessed by experts\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cfrom 2005 to 2014\xe2\x80\x9d. In the Web of Science, we used the search terms \xe2\x80\x9cBully*\xe2\x80\x9d in \xe2\x80\x9cTopic\xe2\x80\x9d AND \xe2\x80\x9cAdolescen* OR Secondary\xe2\x80\x9d in \xe2\x80\x9cTopic\xe2\x80\x9d AND \xe2\x80\x9cRisk factor* OR Predictor*\xe2\x80\x9d in \xe2\x80\x9cTopic\xe2\x80\x9d, limiting the results to only \xe2\x80\x9cArti- cles\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cFrom 2005 to 2014\xe2\x80\x9d.\nThe references obtained were introduced into the 4.0 Zotero bib- liography manager, to eliminate duplicates.

A\xcc\x81lvarez-Garci\xcc\x81a et al. / Aggression and Violent Behavior 23 (2015) 126\xe2\x80\x93136\nabstracts of articles, using the following inclusion/exclusion criteria. The studies had to have been published in the last 10 years since the completion of the search (January 2005\xe2\x80\x93December 2014), in Spanish or English. They had to report results on risk factors of tradi- tional school bullying perpetration. We therefore excluded those works focused only on bully\xe2\x80\x93victim, victimization or observation; those focused on broader constructs such as youth violence, school aggression or violence; those focused only on cyberbullying; and those concerned with bullying in other settings such as workplace bullying, bullying in prisons or sibling bullying. The works had to be empirical papers (we excluded theoretical articles, reviews, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and revisions). The sample should include at least 500 subjects, adolescents or preadolescents (12\xe2\x80\x9318 years), and should not be limited to a specific gender or a mi- nority group (racial/ethnic, nationality, culture of origin, sexual ori- entation, disability). In case of discrepancy between the two reviewers, the reference was preserved for deeper analysis in the next phase. In this next phase, we repeated the process, this time with the complete texts of pre-selected references, resulting in the final sample.\nOnce we had selected the references that made up the final sample, we extracted the relevant information from the full texts. For this pur- pose, we developed a form for the collection of the following data: code assigned to the article, reviewer, year of publication, journal, lan- guage, number of subjects analyzed, age range, country of the sample, informant, data collection method, type of analysis, and findings on risk factors.\n2.2.

The categories, therefore, are not mutually exclusive. The percentage is calculat- ed with regard to the number of articles that inform the age range of the sample (N = 77).\nbetween 2005 and 2014, with a predominance of articles between 2010 and 2013, in English or Spanish, with a clear majority of articles in English.\nAs for the samples appearing in reviewed articles (Table 2), the number of subjects analyzed in the different works is very variable\xe2\x80\x94between 515 and 594,638 children or teenagers\xe2\x80\x94, with a pre- dominance of articles with between 1001 and 5000 subjects. More spe- cifically, most of the articles (25.9%) dealt with a sample of 1001 to 2000 subjects. The age of the samples dealt with in the studies reviewed ranged from 2 to 22 years, with a predominance of ages between 12 and 16 years. The countries to which the analyzed samples belong are varied: countries of America, Europe, Asia and Oceania.\nThe reviewed studies used diverse methods to collect and analyze the data (Table 3). However, they are mostly cross-sectional studies, in which the data were collected through self-report questionnaires, and the analyses were performed using regression analysis.\nSchool Violence\nYouth And Adolescence School Health Adolescence\nInterpersonal Violence\nOther (only one article)\nTotal\n \nTable 3\nMethodological characteristics of the articles included in the systematic review (N = 85), relating to the collection and analysis of data.\nAge is one of the most widely analyzed variables. Some studies found no statistically significant association between age and being a bully (Larochette et al., 2010; Lee, 2010; Stefanek et al., 2011; Tippett et al., 2013). However, most of the works offer results that are consistent with the existence of a curvilinear relationship between the two vari- ables. The probability of a student being a bully increases from grade to grade until about age 14 years, when it decreases (Atik & Gu\xcc\x88neri, 2013; Barboza et al., 2009; Barker et al., 2008; Caballo et al., 2011; Carlyle & Steinman, 2007; CDC, 2011; Gendron et al., 2011; Magklara et al., 2012; Nation et al., 2008; Santinello et al., 2011; Volk et al., 2006; Wei et al., 2010; Williams & Guerra, 2011). However, some studies have found a progressive decrease in the probability of being a bully from age 11\xe2\x80\x9312 years onwards (Lambert et al., 2008; Shetgiri, Lin, Avila, & Flores, 2012; Tochigi et al., 2012).\nRace/ethnicity is another relevant socio-demographic factor. Only one of the studies reviewed, carried out in South Wales, concludes that there is no statistically significant association between race/ethnic- ity and being a bully in the analyzed sample (Lambert et al., 2008). The most widespread pattern of results is that, in each setting analyzed, the students of certain ethnic, racial, or cultural minorities are more likely to be bullies than the majority group. Thus, studies carried out in the United States or in Canada have found a higher probability of being bullies among African American or Hispanic students than in white stu- dents (Carlyle & Steinman, 2007; Larochette et al., 2010; Lovegrove et al., 2012; Low & Espelage, 2013; Shetgiri, Lin, Avila, et al., 2012; Spriggs, Iannotti, Nansel, & Haynie, 2007; Wang, Iannotti, & Nansel, 2009); in Israel, there was a higher probability of being a bully in Arab students (minority group) than in Jews (majority) (Laufer et al., 2006); and in the United Kingdom, Caribbean and Pakistanis were more likely than whites to be bullies (Tippett et al., 2013). However, some ethnic minority groups tend to have a lower probability of being bullies than the majority group. Thus, in the USA, the Asian or Pacific Is- landers have a lower tendency to be bullies than white people (Barboza et al., 2009; Carlyle & Steinman, 2007; Espelage et al., 2014; Shetgiri, Lin, & Flores, 2012).\nThe analysis of the condition of immigrant as a risk factor for being a bully provides inconsistent results and does not allow extracting a clear pattern. Some studies have found that immigrant students are more likely to be bullies. In this sense, in Brazil, Prodocimo et al. (2014) found that students whose mother had been born in the same state of Brazil in which they currently lived were less likely to be bullies; and in Norway, Fandrem et al. (2009) found that immigrant students report- ed performing more bullying than the native Norwegian students. How- ever, other studies have found the opposite: immigrant students are less likely to bully. Thus, Shetgiri et al. (2013) found in their USA sample that being a student born in the USA is a risk factor for being a bully; and if the primary language spoken in the student's home is not English, there is less likelihood of bullying (Shetgiri, Lin, Avila, et al., 2012; Shetgiri, Lin, & Flores, 2012; Shetgiri et al., 2013). Lastly, Stefanek et al. (2011), with a sample of pupils in Austria, found that being an immi- grant of another nationality does not have a statistically significant asso- ciation with bullying.\n3.1.2. Student physical factors\nThe association between some student physical characteristics and\nbeing a bully has been analyzed. Children whose parents gave them high scores in motricity (skill, balance, flexibility) at preschool were more likely to be bullies and less likely to be victims at age 10\xe2\x80\x93 11 years. However, this score does not allow predicting being a bully at age 13\xe2\x80\x9314 years, but it does allow prediction of victimization (Jansen et al., 2011). The student's weight does not allow prediction of being a bully (Kim et al., 2009; Yang et al., 2013). Neither has students' height proven to be a particularly relevant risk of being a bully (Yang et al., 2013). Only one of the reviewed studies indicated that taller boys (not girls) had a slightly increased risk of performing some types of bullying (Kim et al., 2009).

Sociodemographic factors\nSex is, by far, the most analyzed variable in the reviewed works.\nThere are very few studies that do not find a statistically significant as- sociation between sex and being a bully (Espelage, Polanin, & Low, 2014; Lovegrove, Henry, & Slater, 2012; Shetgiri, Lin, & Flores, 2013; Wang et al., 2012). The results consistently indicate a greater likelihood of being a bully in boys than in girls (Atik & Gu\xcc\x88neri, 2013; Barboza et al., 2009; Barker, Arseneault, Brendgen, Fontaine, & Mauchan, 2008; Caballo, Arias, Calderero, Salazar, & Irurtia, 2011; Carlyle & Steinman, 2007; Carrera-Ferna\xcc\x81ndez, Lameiras-Ferna\xcc\x81ndez, Rodri\xcc\x81guez-Castro, & Vallejo-Medina, 2013; Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC), 2011; Cerezo & Me\xcc\x81ndez, 2012; Chang et al., 2013; De Bruyn, Cillessen, & Wissink, 2010; Donnon, 2010; Fandrem, Strohmeier, & Roland, 2009; Fanti & Kimonis, 2012; Farhat, Iannotti, & Simons-Morton, 2009; Gendron, Williams, & Guerra, 2011; Guerra, Williams, & Sadek, 2011; Hemphill et al., 2012; Jansen, Veenstra, Ormel, Verhulst, & Reijneveld, 2011; Kim, Boyce, Koh, & Leventhal, 2009; Kuzman, S\xcc\x8cimetin, & Franelic\xcc\x81, 2007; Lambert, Scourfield, Smalley, & Jones, 2008; Larochette, Murphy, & Craig, 2010; Laufer, Harel, & Molcho, 2006; Magklara et al., 2012; Ma- rini, Dane, Bosacki, & Ylc-Cura, 2006; Me\xcc\x81ndez & Cerezo, 2010; Nation, Vieno, Perkins, & Santinello, 2008; Nocentini, Menesini, & Salmivalli, 2013; Pepler, Jiang, Craig, & Connolly, 2008; Pitel et al., 2012; Postigo, Gonza\xcc\x81lez, Mateu, & Montoya, 2012; Poteat, DiGiovanni, & Scheer, 2013; Prodocimo, Cerezo, & Arense, 2014; Santinello, Vieno, & De Vogli, 2011; Scholte, Sentse, & Granic, 2010; Shetgiri, Lin, & Flores, 2012; Stefanek, Strohmeier, Van de Schoot, & Spiel, 2011; Tippett, Wolke, & Platt, 2013; Tochigi et al., 2012; Vieno, Gini, & Santinello, 2011; Volk, Craig, Boyce, & King, 2006; Wei, Williams, Chen, & Chang, 2010; Williams & Guerra, 2011; Yang et al., 2013). Only one of the reviewed articles found a higher probability of being a bully in girls (Viding, Simmonds, Petrides, & Frederickson, 2009), and only referring to \xe2\x80\x9cindirect bullying\xe2\x80\x9d.\n130 D. A\xcc\x81lvarez-Garci\xcc\x81a et al. / Aggression and Violent Behavior 23 (2015) 126\xe2\x80\x93136\nIndex has been studied more frequently, providing mixed results. The data of the CDC (2011) indicate that there is a higher percentage of overweight or obese students among bullies than among victims or in uninvolved students. Kukaswadia, Craig, Janssen, and Pickett (2011) found that this association occurs mainly in obese girls, who are three times more likely to be relational bullies than girls with normal weight. However, Farhat et al. (2009) found that when controlling statistically only for gender, being an obese girl (but not a boy) is a significant predictor of being a bully, but when controlling statistically also for age, socioeconomic status, race, and family composition, obesity is no longer a significant predictor of being a bully. Magklara et al. (2012) found a different pattern of results: body mass index is non-linearly associated with a low risk of being bully at both extremes.\nThe predictor role of some physical health problems for being a bully has also been analyzed. In general, physical health problems reported by students are compatible with daring behavior and aggressions, as well as with certain disabilities. Bullies report having poor or bad health to a greater extent than students not involved in bullying (CDC, 2011). Bullies are at increased risk of suffering accidental or perpetrated injuries than those who are not involved in bullying (Srabstein & Piazza, 2008). Both in boys and girls, bullies are more likely to have suffered a wound or injury that required medical care in the past year (Starkuviene\xcc\x87 & Zaborskis, 2005) or some traumatic brain injury throughout their life (Ilie et al., 2014).\nReports of headache, stomach ache, backache, cough, or cold are more common in bullies than in people uninvolved in bullying (Volk et al., 2006). On the other hand, none of the following chronic diseases is significantly associated with being a bully: eczema, allergies, asthma, diabetes, visual impairment, speech difficulties, motor disability, gastro- intestinal problems, and epilepsy (Nordhagen, Nielsen, Stigum, & Ko\xcc\x88hler, 2005). Having a hearing impairment does increase the probabil- ity of being a bully in the study of Nordhagen et al. (2005). The percent- age of bullies who report having some kind of disability is not higher than that of the victims, but it is higher than that of students uninvolved in bullying (CDC, 2011).\n3.1.3. Psychological factors\n3.1.3.1. Personality traits. Impulsivity and hyperactivity increase the likeli- hood of being a bully (Fanti & Kimonis, 2012; Low & Espelage, 2014; Marini et al., 2006; Viding et al., 2009). However, Yang et al. (2013) found that ADHD symptoms reported by parents at age 10 are not significant predictors of being a bully at age 12. Perhaps this is due to the fact this measure includes symptoms both of impulsivity\xe2\x80\x93hyperac- tivity and inattention.\nEmpathy correlated negatively with being a bully (Casas, Del Rey, & Ortega-Ruiz, 2013; Poteat et al., 2013). Having a poor Theory of Mind at age 5 is a risk factor for being a bully at age 12, although this associa- tion is statistically explained by two family factors: socioeconomic status (deprivation) and child maltreatment (Shakoor et al., 2012). Callous-unemotional traits increase the probability of being a bully (Fanti & Kimonis, 2012; Viding et al., 2009), as does moral disengage- ment (Pepler et al., 2008).\nAggressiveness is positively associated with being a bully (Kim, Leventhal, Koh, Hubbard, & Boyce, 2006; Nocentini et al., 2013). The data obtained by Fandrem et al. (2009) in Norway show that being a bully is more closely related to reactive than to proactive aggressive- ness. With the total sample, both power-related proactive aggression (aggressiveness to increase one's power in the group, intimidating others) as affiliation-related proactive aggressiveness (aggression to earn friendship, group acceptance) can predict being a bully (the former, notably so), whereas reactive aggressiveness is not a statistically significant predictor. In native Norwegians specifically, all three types of aggression are predictors of being a bully, especially power-related pro- active aggression, and the association with reactive aggression is very\nlow. In immigrants, only affiliation-related proactive aggressiveness is a statistically significant predictor of being a bully.\nStudents with anti-social behavior problems are more likely to be bullies (Cerezo & Me\xcc\x81ndez, 2012; Viding et al., 2009; Wei et al., 2010), especially if the behavior problems are accompanied by callous- unemotional traits (Fanti, 2013; Fanti & Kimonis, 2012; Viding et al., 2009). There is a significant association between being a bully and having run away from home or having thought about doing so (Wang et al., 2012); having been involved in physical fights (Shetgiri, Lin, & Flores, 2012; Wang et al., 2012); deliberately hurting animals and people (Srabstein & Piazza, 2008); bearing arms (Barboza et al., 2009; Bradshaw, Waasdorp, Goldweber, & Johnson, 2013; Donnon, 2010; Donnon & Hammond, 2007; Shetgiri, Lin, & Flores, 2012; Srabstein & Piazza, 2008); stealing from a shop (Donnon & Hammond, 2007); and having been arrested by the police (Me\xcc\x81ndez & Cerezo, 2010). Bullies also report a higher consumption of tobacco (Shetgiri, Lin, & Flores, 2012; Smith, Phongsavan, Bauman, Havea, & Chey, 2007; Vieno et al., 2011), alcohol (Donnon & Hammond, 2007; Laufer et al., 2006; Peleg-Oren, Cardenas, Comerford, & Galea, 2012; Shetgiri, Lin, & Flores, 2012; Smith et al., 2007; Tochigi et al., 2012; Vieno et al., 2011; Volk et al., 2006) or illegal drugs (Farhat, Simons-Morton, & Luk, 2011; Laufer et al., 2006; Shetgiri, Lin, & Flores, 2012; Smith et al., 2007; Tochigi et al., 2012; Volk et al., 2006) than do victims and people uninvolved in bully- ing (Bradshaw et al., 2013; Carlyle & Steinman, 2007; CDC, 2011; Cerezo & Me\xcc\x81ndez, 2012; Low & Espelage, 2014; Me\xcc\x81ndez & Cerezo, 2010). The rate of polydrug use is higher in bullies than in victims and uninvolved students (Cerezo & Me\xcc\x81ndez, 2012).\nThe relationship between self-esteem and being a bully is complex and its study has given rise to mixed results. Some studies have found a negative association between both variables: low self-esteem levels predict high levels of bullying (Guerra et al., 2011). In this case, abuse of peers would be used by bullies to feel better about themselves, com- pensating for their low self-concept in other areas, and achieving a higher status in the group. Other works have found a positive associa- tion between self-esteem and being a bully: the probability of being a bully is greater when the student has high self-esteem (Gendron et al., 2011; Marini et al., 2006). In this case, bullies use their greater self- esteem, and probably their higher status within the group compared to the victim, to carry out the abuse. In this sense, Fanti and Kimonis (2012) found a positive association between narcissism and being a bully. Narcissism would especially contribute to the stability over time of bullying perpetration. Perhaps because of this ambivalent relation- ship between self-esteem and being a bully, the majority of the reviewed studies analyzing the relationship between the two variables have found that the association between them is nonsignificant (Atik & Gu\xcc\x88neri, 2013; Barboza et al., 2009; Nation et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2013); that is, the probability of being a bully is independent of the stu- dents' degree of self-esteem.\nAnxiety does not predict being a bully (Jansen et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2013). On the other hand, a greater presence of depressive symptoms predicts being a bully, although to a lesser extent than being a victim (Carlyle & Steinman, 2007; CDC, 2011; Marini et al., 2006; Wei et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2013). The probability of being a bully increases among those who have an external locus of causality (Atik & Gu\xcc\x88neri, 2013). Suicidal ideation and suicide attempts\xe2\x80\x94like intentional self- harm (CDC, 2011; Srabstein & Piazza, 2008)\xe2\x80\x94are more common among bullies than students who are not involved in bullying (CDC, 2011; Wang et al., 2012).\nBullies tend to be more extrovert than the victims. Social anxiety is more common in victims than in bullies, and it is more common in both of them than in students not involved in bullying (Marini et al., 2006). Social anxiety does not have a statistically significant correlation with being a bully, but it does correlate with being a victim (Caballo et al., 2011). Analysis of social competence as a risk factor for being a bully offers two types of results. On the one hand, some studies have found a negative relationship between the degree of social skills and\nbeing a bully. Postigo et al. (2012) found that social skills are a negative predictor of maladjustment, which in turn positively predicts being a bully and negatively predicts peer acceptance. In turn, peer acceptance negatively predicts being a bully. In the same vein, Bayraktar (2012) found that coping skills and social cognition are negatively related to being a bully. However, on the other hand, some studies have found that social competence is greater in bullies than in victims and that this competence is positively associated with being a bully and nega- tively with being a victim (Nation et al., 2008). Bullies will take advan- tage of their social competence to maintain their dominance over the victim and perpetuate the abuse.\nSensation seeking, that is, performing risky, dangerous or forbidden behaviors, is a predictor of being a bully (Laufer et al., 2006; Lee, 2010; Lovegrove et al., 2012; Me\xcc\x81ndez & Cerezo, 2010). Among other activities, bullies are more likely than victims or students uninvolved in bullying to have driven vehicles under the influence of alcohol (Me\xcc\x81ndez & Cerezo, 2010), to never or rarely use the seat belt as passengers (CDC, 2011) and to have had a sexual experience before the age of 15 (Kuzman et al., 2007).\n3.1.3.2. Attitudes and values. Certain attitudes constitute a risk factor for being a bully. Tolerant attitudes towards anti-social and aggressive behaviors (Lee, 2010; Marini et al., 2006), as well as towards bullying (Carrera-Ferna\xcc\x81ndez et al., 2013; Gendron et al., 2011; Guerra et al., 2011; Scholte et al., 2010; Stefanek et al., 2011), are positively associat- ed with being a bully. Competitive attitudes\xe2\x80\x94a desire for social success (Nocentini et al., 2013)\xe2\x80\x94, sexist attitudes towards women (Carrera- Ferna\xcc\x81ndez et al., 2013), and negative attitudes towards homosexuals (Carrera-Ferna\xcc\x81ndez et al., 2013; Poteat et al., 2013) are also positively associated with being a bully.\nWith regard to values, specifically religious values, Pitel et al. (2012) found in a sample of students from Slovakia that students who declare that religious faith is very important in their lives and who also state they go to church or Mass frequently are less likely to report bullying perpetration than students who grant low importance to religion and who do not attend church services or Mass.\n3.1.3.3. Sexual orientation. Boys and girls who reported being homosex- ual (gay or lesbian) are less likely to report having been bullies during the past year than those who report being heterosexual\xe2\x80\x94but they are more likely to have been victims. Bisexual girls are more likely to have been bullies\xe2\x80\x94and victims\xe2\x80\x94than heterosexual girls (Berlan, Corliss, Field, Goodman, & Austin, 2010).\n3.1.3.4. Mental health problems. Students involved in bullying situations, either as a bully, a victim, or both, report poorer health status than those who are not involved in bullying (CDC, 2011; Srabstein, McCarter, Shao, & Huang, 2006). In particular, the health problems that can predict being a bully to a greater extent are emotional, behavioral, or develop- mental problems (Shetgiri, Lin, Avila, et al., 2012; Van Cleave & Davis, 2006). Among these problems, helplessness, insecurity, feeling low, moodiness, nervousness, and insomnia\xe2\x80\x94internalizing problems\xe2\x80\x94correlate positively with being a victim and negatively with being a bully (Volk et al., 2006). Bullies are more likely to present problems like hyperactiv- ity or behavioral problems\xe2\x80\x94externalizing problems (Nordhagen et al., 2005).\n3.2. School factors\n3.2.1. Academic commitment\nBullies express less commitment to school (working hard, following\nthe rules of the school) than victims and students uninvolved in bully- ing (Cunningham, 2007). Except for three works that found no statisti- cally significant relation between academic performance and being a bully (Atik & Gu\xcc\x88neri, 2013; Wang et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2013), the rest of the studies that analyzed this association coincide in highlighting\npoor academic performance as a risk factor for being a bully (Bradshaw et al., 2013; CDC, 2011; Chang et al., 2013; Hemphill et al., 2012; Lovegrove et al., 2012; Magklara et al., 2012; Mlisa, Ward, Flisher, & Lombard, 2008; Shetgiri, Lin, & Flores, 2012; Spriggs et al., 2007). The percentage of repeater bullies is greater than that of victims or students not involved in bullying (Cerezo & Me\xcc\x81ndez, 2012; Me\xcc\x81ndez & Cerezo, 2010).\nStudents whose parents report that they usually or always do their homework are less likely is to be bullies (Shetgiri, Lin, Avila, et al., 2012). Students who skip classes (truancy) are more likely to be bullies (Bradshaw et al., 2013; Donnon & Hammond, 2007).\nHaving changed classes within the same center during the last three years is significantly associated with being a bully (Nocentini et al., 2013). The number of discipline referrals is positively associated with the probability of the student identifying him- or herself as a bully (Totura, Green, Karver, & Gesten, 2009). Some studies indicate that the percentage of bullies who have been expelled from the school is higher than that of the victims or the students uninvolved in bullying (Me\xcc\x81ndez & Cerezo, 2010). On the other hand, other studies have found that having been expelled from school in the 7th grade is not significantly associated with being a bully in the 9th grade (Hemphill et al., 2012).\n3.2.2. Relationship with fellow students\nHaving the support from the classroom, either due to classmates' pro-bullying attitude or their fear of being the next victim, is a risk factor for being a bully. The number of mutual friends, assessed by peer nomination, is positively associated with being a bully (Scholte et al., 2010). The feeling of being excluded is negatively associated with being a bully (Barboza et al., 2009) and the perception of positive interactions is positively associated with reporting being a bully\xe2\x80\x94although to a lesser extent than negative interactions (Casas et al., 2013). Bullies perceive less social isolation than victims (Spriggs et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2012).\nHowever, being a bully is also associated with more peer rejection, either due to their aggressive behavior or to other personal characteris- tics. Thus, some studies show that bullies tend to perceive more conflicts and worse relations with peers (Bayraktar, 2012; Lovegrove et al., 2012; Pepler et al., 2008; Spriggs et al., 2007), and that the degree of sociometric acceptance (liking, being liked by classmates, being preferred as friends) is negatively associated with being a bully (De Bruyn et al., 2010; Postigo et al., 2012; Scholte et al., 2010). In any case, unsatisfactory relationships with classmates (experiences of isolation, being harassed) are more common in victims than in bullies and students uninvolved in bullying (Marini et al., 2006).\nThis double relation may explain why some studies have not found a statistically significant association between being a bully and cohesion or perceived relation with classmates (Barboza et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2012).\nBeing a bully is positively associated with sociometric popularity (visibility, center of attention). This association is stronger in adolescents with low levels of sociometric acceptance and also stronger in boys than in girls (De Bruyn et al., 2010).\n3.2.3. Prior relationship with bullying\nAmong the reviewed works that analyze this variable, the authors are unanimous in asserting that having been a bully in the past increases the likelihood of the adolescent's being a bully currently. Having reported being a bully at the beginning of the course significantly predicts reporting being a bully at the end of the same course (Gendron et al., 2011; Williams & Guerra, 2011). Being currently a bully correlates positively with having been a bully one (Low & Espelage, 2013, 2014) or two years ago (Fanti & Kimonis, 2012; Hemphill et al., 2012; Nocentini et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2013).\nLikewise, the results are fairly consistent in asserting that having been the victim of bullying in the past increases the adolescent's current\nD.

A\xcc\x81lvarez-Garci\xcc\x81a et al. / Aggression and Violent Behavior 23 (2015) 126\xe2\x80\x93136\nlikelihood of being a bully (Barboza et al., 2009; Barker et al., 2008; Fanti & Kimonis, 2012; Hemphill et al., 2012; Lee, 2010; Shetgiri, Lin, & Flores, 2012), although to a lesser extent than having been a bully (Guerra et al., 2011). Only one of the reviewed works concludes that having been a victim of bullying in the past is not a significant predictor of being a bully in the sample analyzed (Yang et al., 2013).\nFinally, permissive or encouraging attitudes of their classmates towards bullying and the frequency of bullying behavior in their class are both risk factors for a student to become a bully (Nocentini et al., 2013; Perkins, Craig, & Perkins, 2011; Scholte et al., 2010).\n3.2.4. Diversity in the educational center\nThe ethnic diversity of pupils in the student's class or school does not\nlead to a greater likelihood of that student reporting being a bully (Espelage et al., 2014; Larochette et al., 2010; Stefanek et al., 2011). The percentage of girls in a student's classroom had no statistically signif- icant association with that student reporting being a bully (Stefanek et al., 2011). The percentage of girls in the student's school had a negative association with that student reporting being a bully (Espelage et al., 2014).\nRegarding the diversity of the teachers, the student's perception of receiving support and assistance at school is negatively related to performing relational bullying, and this relationship is stronger when there is a higher level of diversity of teachers\xe2\x80\x94the percentage of teachers who are visible minorities\xe2\x80\x94in the center (Larochette et al., 2010).\n3.2.5. Quality of the relationship with the teachers\nMost of the reviewed studies that analyze this variable found that teachers' support and good personal treatment towards students is a protective factor against the student becoming a bully (Barboza et al., 2009; Casas et al., 2013; Gregory et al., 2010; Simo\xcc\x83es & Gaspar-Matos, 2011; Wei et al., 2010). Only one article concluded that the relationship with the teachers is not a statistically significant predictor of a student's reporting being a bully (Wang et al., 2012).\nThe probability of being a bully is higher in students whose teachers have low expectations about their performance in school (Barboza et al., 2009).\n3.2.6. Climate of coexistence in the school\nThe student's perception that the center is safe and the school has a positive climate of coexistence is negatively associated with reports of being a bully (Casas et al., 2013; Gendron et al., 2011; Spriggs et al., 2007; Stefanek et al., 2011). The student's perception that the teachers promote mutual respect in the center is negatively associated with being a bully (Bayraktar, 2012; Espelage et al., 2014; Poteat et al., 2013). Exposure to violence at school correlates positively with being a bully one year later (Low & Espelage, 2014).\n3.2.7. Management of coexistence by the center\nStudents who perceive a democratic disciplinary style in their center are less likely to report being bullies (Bayraktar, 2012). A student's perception that the rules of the Center are clear and fair and also justly and consistently applied decreases the probability of being a bully (Barboza et al., 2009; Gregory et al., 2010; Lambert et al., 2008; Santinello et al., 2011). Casas et al. (2013) propose the hypothesis that this relationship is not direct: the consistency and clarity of the rules of the center are negatively associated with negative relationships among the students and positively associated with positive relation- ships. These relationships, in turn, predict the respondent's reporting being a bully.\nBullies and victims perceive to a lesser extent that bullying is consid- ered a problem in their center and that interventions to stop it are being implemented than do students who are uninvolved in bullying (Cunningham, 2007). The development of activities in the school to\nprevent bullying reported by the teachers and the school staff decreases the probability of students' reporting being bullies (Espelage et al., 2014).\n3.2.8. School satisfaction, sense of belonging to school\nSatisfaction with the school is a protective factor against being a bully (Simo\xcc\x83es & Gaspar-Matos, 2011; Shetgiri, Lin, & Flores, 2012; Spriggs et al., 2007). The feeling of belonging to the school decreases the probability of being a bully (Lovegrove et al., 2012). However, par- ticipation in clubs, organizations or sports teams at school does not present a significant association with being a bully (Shetgiri et al., 2013).\n3.2.9. Characteristics of the educational center\nFew studies among those reviewed have analyzed the effect of class\nor center size on the probability of being a bully. The results show that the size (number of students) of a student's school is not significantly associated with that student being a bully (Tochigi et al., 2012; Wei et al., 2010). The teacher/student ratio (number of students per teacher) does not have a statistically significant association with reports of being a bully in the only article reviewed that analyzed this variable (Wei et al., 2010). On the other hand, another study found that the class size (the number of students per class) is negatively associated with being a bully (Stefanek et al., 2011).\nOnly one study analyzed the socioeconomic status of the center attended by the student as a possible risk factor for being a bully (Espelage et al., 2014). Taking as an indicator the percentage of students who receive free or reduced lunch at school, no statistically significant association between this variable and the students' reports of being a bully was observed.\n3.3. Family factors\n3.3.1. Socioeconomic status of the family\nTo analyze the predictive role of the family socioeconomic status on being a bully, the reviewed articles used three indicators: parents' educational level, employment status, and level of income. Overall, the results show that socioeconomic status is not a determinant, and that students with high and low status have a similar probability of being bullies.\nRegarding the parents' educational level, none of the reviewed studies that have analyzed it found a statistically significant association between the father's educational level and his son being a bully (Barboza et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2009; Magklara et al., 2012; Mohapatra et al., 2010; Shetgiri et al., 2013). With regard to the mother's educational level, most studies found no statistically signifi- cant association (Barboza et al., 2009; Espelage et al., 2014; Kim et al., 2009; Mohapatra et al., 2010; Shetgiri et al., 2013). Only Magklara et al. (2012) found that the fact that the mother had completed second- ary education is associated with a lower risk of being a bully.\nRegarding parents' employment status, the only reviewed article that analyzed this variable is that of Magklara et al. (2012). In this study, the mother's employment status does not predict being a bully, but that of the father does. Having an unemployed or self-employed father is a risk factor and having a retired father is a protective factor.\nFinally, regarding the level of family income, most of the works find that its association with the student being a bully is not statistically significant (Larochette et al., 2010; Magklara et al., 2012; Shetgiri et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2009, 2012). Two studies concluded that students with a high family income level in their samples present a greater risk of being bullies: Barboza et al. (2009) conclude that, in the analyzed sample, being a bully is more likely as the level of family income increases; and Chang et al. (2013) conclude that the student's perception of economic difficulties in the family reduces the probability of being an aggressor and increases that of being a victim, compared with students who have a higher family income. Only one study found that children living in families with low income are more likely to be\nbullies (Shetgiri, Lin, Avila, et al., 2012). Jansen et al. (2011), whereas considering the family socioeconomic status globally (level of income, educational level, and work status of father and mother taken conjointly), they found that a low status when the child is 10\xe2\x80\x93 11 years old allows predicting being a bully at 10\xe2\x80\x9311 years of age and also being a bully at age 13\xe2\x80\x9314.\n3.3.2. Family structure\nThe studies reviewed provide two types of result. On the one hand, five studies conclude that living with both biological parents, living only with the father or the mother or other situations does not significantly predict being a bully in the samples analyzed (Barboza et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2009; Mohapatra et al., 2010; Prodocimo et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2012). On the other hand, another five studies found that nontraditional family structures (not living with both biological parents) may be a risk factor for being a bully (Breivik & Olweus, 2006; Jansen et al., 2011; Pepler et al., 2008; Spriggs et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2013).\n3.3.3. Parental educational style\nResults were obtained that agree that scarce parental control is a risk\nfactor for the student to be a bully. The establishment of family rules and the parents' interest in their children's schoolwork, friendships, and activities decreases the probability of the students being bullies (Atik & Gu\xcc\x88neri, 2013; Go\xcc\x81mez-Ortiz, Del Rey, Casas, & Ortega-Ruiz, 2014; Low & Espelage, 2013, 2014; Marini et al., 2006; Pepler et al., 2008; Shetgiri, Lin, Avila, et al., 2012; Simo\xcc\x83es & Gaspar-Matos, 2011). In the same vein, the results are fairly consistent in pointing out that scarce closeness and trust towards the parents, as well as communication difficul- ties with them constitute a risk factor for the student to be a bully (Bayraktar, 2012; Go\xcc\x81mez-Ortiz et al., 2014; Marini et al., 2006; Pepler et al., 2008; Shetgiri, Lin, Avila, et al., 2012; Shetgiri, Lin, & Flores, 2012; Shetgiri et al., 2013; Spriggs et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2012). Scarce parental emotional support perceived by the student may also be risk fac- tor to be a bully (Barboza et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2009, 2012).\nThe attitudes and values transmitted by parents also have an impact on student bully behavior. Thus, for example, parents' positive attitudes towards sexual minorities are negatively associated with students' prejudice towards gays and lesbians, which, in turn, is positively associated with being a bully (Poteat et al., 2013).\n3.3.4. Exposure to family violence\nThe results obtained are consistent in pointing out that exposure to family violence is a risk factor for being a bully. The presence of family conflicts and domestic violence by adults is positively associated with being a bully (Hemphill et al., 2012; Low & Espelage, 2013, 2014; Tochigi et al., 2012). More specifically, the bully is more likely to report having suffered physical harm or abuse by an adult relative (CDC, 2011; Duke, Pettingell, McMorris, & Borowsky, 2010), having suffered sexual abuse by a family member (Duke et al., 2010), or having witnessed family violence or physical abuse among family members (CDC, 2011; Duke et al., 2010). On the other hand, girls whose families were attended to at some time by the Child Protective Services (public services to attend to children who have been abused or neglected by their families) are subsequently more likely to be bullies than girls who were never attended to by those services, although in boys, this variable is not a statistically significant risk factor (Mohapatra et al., 2010).\n3.3.5. Parents' mental health\nThe reviewed studies that have analyzed the impact of the parents' mental health on students' risk of being a bully are very scarce. When mental health is analyzed in general, mixed results have been found. Some studies found that if the mother's mental or emotional health is not very good or excellent, there is a greater probability that the student will be bully (Shetgiri, Lin, Avila, et al., 2012; Shetgiri, Lin, & Flores, 2012;\nShetgiri et al., 2013). Yang et al. (2013), on the other hand, found that the parents' mental health when the child is 10 years old is not a significant predictor of being a bully at 12 years of age. Students who re- ported problematic use of alcohol or drugs in some family member are more likely to report being a bully (Duke et al., 2010).\n3.4. Community factors\n3.4.1. Relationship with friends\nThe number of friends is positively associated with being a bully\n(Barboza et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2009). Students with more emotional support from their friends are more likely to be bullies (Barboza et al., 2009). Being friends of bullies (Pepler et al., 2008), delinquents (Low & Espelage, 2014) or with people with antisocial behavior (Volk et al., 2006), as well as belonging to gangs (Bradshaw et al., 2013) increases one's probability of being a bully. On the other hand, the number of gay, lesbian, or bisexual friends correlates negatively with prejudice towards homosexuals, which, in turn, correlates positively with being a bully (Poteat et al., 2013). Bullies are more susceptible to peer social pressure (Pepler et al., 2008).\n3.4.2. Relationship with the mass media and entertainment media\nThe greater the number of hours that a student reports watching television, the more likely he/she will be to also report being a bully (Barboza et al., 2009).\nThe scarce reviewed studies that analyzed the time spent playing videogames as a possible risk factor for being a bully have yielded incon- clusive results. On the one hand, Barboza et al. (2009) found that the number of hours spent playing videogames does not have a significant association with being a bully. On the other hand, Olson et al. (2009) found that the amount of time spent playing nonviolent videogames or M-rated videogames predicted an increased risk of emitting bullying behaviors (higher in the latter). When analyzing boys and girls separately, in boys, the predictive value of both types of videogame ceases to be statistically significant, and having an aggressive personal- ity becomes a better predictor. In girls, the predictive value of exposure to M-Rated videogames increases, whereas that of nonviolent videogames is no longer statistically significant.\nStudents who reported spending more time online, even those who reported being more addicted to Internet, are more likely to report being bullies (Casas et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2012). Exchanging emails or calling up after turning off the lights at night when going to sleep is a predictor of being a bully (Tochigi et al., 2012). Students who emit risky behaviors on the Internet (sending or publishing personal information, hanging pictures, using a webcam to chat with strangers) are more likely to be bullies than students who do not perform these behaviors (Chang et al., 2013). Those who report being victims of cyberbullying and, especially, those who report being cyberbullies are more likely to report being presential bullies (Chang et al., 2013).\n3.4.3. Aspects related to the neighborhood\nThe fact that the students attend a school located in an urban context\ndoes not increase the likelihood of being a bully (Barboza et al., 2009; Stefanek et al., 2011). Of the three reviewed studies that analyze this variable, only that of Kim et al. (2009) found a statistically significant association: girls who live in the city center are at more risk of being bullies than those who live in suburban environment (close to the city). In boys, the urban setting is not a significant predictor of being a bully in any of the three studies.\nNeither student's self-reported participation in social activities\xe2\x80\x94sports teams, acting in a theater, participating in school or non-school clubs ... (Lovegrove et al., 2012)\xe2\x80\x94, nor the parents' perception that the residents of their neighborhood help each other (Shetgiri et al., 2013) predicts being a bully.\nD. A\xcc\x81lvarez-Garci\xcc\x81a et al. / Aggression and Violent Behavior 23 (2015) 126\xe2\x80\x93136 133\n134 D. A\xcc\x81lvarez-Garci\xcc\x81a et al. / Aggression and Violent Behavior 23 (2015) 126\xe2\x80\x93136\n3.4.4. Socio-political conditions of the country\nElgar et al. (2013), in their study carried out in 37 countries, found that the degree of inequality of family income in the country is positive- ly related to students' reports of being a bully (also of being a victim). The greater the inequality, the more likely it is for the student to be a bully or a victim.\n4. Discussion\nThe goal of this work was to conduct a systematic review of empiri- cal scientific articles published in the last decade that have analyzed possible risk factors that predict perpetration of traditional school bullying in adolescence.\nThe research reviewed yields many controversial results, still under discussion, which deserve to be investigated in more depth in order to unravel the complex relationships among risk factors. However, some trends in the results can be identified.\nRegarding the socio-demographic variables, firstly, boys are more likely to be bullies than girls. Among other causes, some authors have highlighted the impact of the transmission of gender stereotypes, in which masculinity is associated with aggressiveness, competitiveness, toughness, and insensitivity in adolescent behavior (Di\xcc\x81az-Aguado & Marti\xcc\x81n, 2011). Secondly, the results of most of the reviewed works are compatible with an increase in the probability of being a bully until the age of 14, after which it decreases gradually. Some authors, like Hong and Espelage (2012), indicate that early adolescence is a critical period in the exploration of new social roles and the pursuit of status within the peer group. Thirdly, adolescents belonging to some ethnic or racial minorities are more likely to be bullies in certain contexts, whereas others tend to perform less bullying than the majority racial or ethnic group.\nRegarding the student's physical factors, body mass index is the most frequently analyzed. The results show a trend for obesity to increase the risk not only of becoming a victim, as would seem more intuitive, but also of being a bully. Different explanations of the modulating variables of this relationship have been provided. Some authors underline the role of socioeconomic status or race, among other factors; others highlight the importance of the stigma and rejection that one's physical appearance can generate in the group (Farhat et al., 2009; Kukaswadia et al., 2011; Magklara et al., 2012). In any case, the discrimination received could be the origin of diverse antisocial behaviors to gain status in the group, such as being a bully, consuming alcohol, tobacco, or drugs, or even, in certain cultural contexts, bearing weapons.\nWith regard to the psychological factors, being a bully is usually a part of a pattern of antisocial behavior, in which impulsivity, hyperactivity, the absence of empathy, aggressiveness (especially proactive), sensation seeking, and antisocial behavior (drug abuse, aggressive or criminal behavior) are risk factors for being a bully at school and, at the same time, being a bully in adolescence is a predictor of aggression and offending years later (Ttofi et al., 2011, 2012). This relationship between bullying and externalizing problems is very consistently found by previous research (Cook et al., 2010; Van Noorden et al., 2014). However, in addition to these externalizing problems, bullies also are more likely to present some internalizing problems\xe2\x80\x94mainly related to depressive symptomatology\xe2\x80\x94, even though they are more common in victims than in bullies (Cook et al., 2010). Some psycholog- ical variables, like self-esteem and social competence, have shown an ambivalent relationship with bullying perpetration. In both cases, both low and high levels can predict an increased risk of bullying and its interaction with other variables is the key to understand its effect.\nRegarding school factors, low academic achievement and the lack of interest in studies are also relevant risk factors to be a bully. This is consistent with the already extensive literature showing the relation- ship between externalizing problems and poor academic performance (Cook et al., 2010). The relationship with classmates is ambivalent. On the one hand, bullies may be rejected by most of their classmates, but\nthey may also have the support of some classmates, who are the ones who, by action or omission, make abuse possible.\nPrior student participation in bullying situations, either as a victim or, above all, as an aggressor, also increases the student's likelihood of a being a bully. Belonging to a class in which bullying is frequent or in which the students encourage or allow bullying is also a risk factor. The diffusion of responsibility in the crowd, mutual reinforcement, trying to gain status by joining the bully and avoiding being close to the victim, trying to imitate a bully perceived as cool, trying to be accepted by him or her, or trying to be included in the group by adapting to its abusive behavior are some reasons that have been suggested to explain this process of social influence (Salmivalli, 2010).\nStudents' perception that they receive support and good treatment by teachers, as well as the existence of clear and fair rules in the center that are applied justly, is all protective factors against bullying (Di\xcc\x81az- Aguado & Marti\xcc\x81nez, 2013). In addition, abuse is sometimes perpetuated and aggravated because it remains hidden from adults, so good commu- nication with students is essential to detect and address it (Thornberg, 2011).\nWith regard to the family factors, socio-economic status does not seem to be the most important factor in the probability that a student will become a bully (Tippett & Wolke, 2014). The incidence of family structure also offers unclear results about assuming a greater or lesser risk of being a bully. Other family variables seem to be more important, such as the establishment of behavior limits; the parents' interest in their children's schoolwork, friendships, and activities; closeness, trust, and communication with parents; perceived parental emotional support; or the attitudes and values transmitted. Exposure to family violence is a risk factor for being a bully.\nFinally, with respect to community factors, although the number of friends outside the class correlates positively with being a bully, it seems that the relevant variable is the type of friends that the student has. Being friends of bullies or of people with antisocial behavior increases the probability of being a bully. Having friends with anti- bullying attitudes is a protective factor. Adolescents tend to be highly susceptible to the influence of peers and tend to adjust their way of thinking and acting to the standard within the group (Wo\xcc\x88lfer & Scheithauer, 2014).\nBullies tend to devote more time to watching television and being connected to the Internet. Those who report being victims of cyberbullying and, especially, those who report being cyberbullies are more likely to report being presential bullies. There is significant overlap between online and face-to-face bullying (Del Rey, Elipe, & Ortega-Ruiz, 2012).\n5. Conclusions and limitations\nIn short, this systematic review constitutes a contribution to the knowledge of the main risk factors of school bullying perpetration in adolescence. On the basis of articles published in the last 10 years in three of the main worldwide publication bases, we offer an updated and ordered overview of the scientific evidence published in recent years on the subject. From the point of view of clinical or educational practice, we hope that the evidence presented herein will facilitate early identification of children at risk of being bullies in adolescence and that it will serve as a basis for the design of preventive measures and effective treatment. From the research point of view, we expect to have highlighted consistencies and inconsistencies in the available evidence to guide future research.\nHowever, this study has some limitations, which should be acknowledged. Firstly, the search was limited to three publication bases which, although they are some of the most important, do not exhaust all the publications on the reviewed topic. Second, the search was limited to articles written in English or Spanish. Surely, excellent works published in other languages or other publication databases have been left out. Thirdly, and finally, only evidence published in\narticles of scientific journals were analyzed. It is therefore possible that the results may be affected to some extent by publication bias or the tendency of journals to publish works that find positive and significant differences (Perestelo-Pe\xcc\x81rez, 2013).\nReferences1\n*Atik, G., & Gu\xcc\x88neri, O.

Aimsofthestudy . . . .\nabstract\nBullying and cyberbullying are present all over the world and have serious consequences for individuals and so- cieties. The number of research studies on the topic has increased exponentially throughout the history, but many questions related to the phenomena remain unanswered. The current study is a systematic review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses on the topic. Systematic searches were conducted in 7 databases and Aggressive and Violent Behavior journal. A total number of 66 studies met the inclusion criteria. The main findings are that one of every three children is involved in some forms of bullying and one of every five in some forms of cyberbullying. Boys are more involved than girls but with small or trivial effect sizes, and relationship with age is also weak. There is strong overlap between bullying and cyberbullying and bullying is an important problem among minorities. Results show risk and protective factors for bullying and cyberbullying, together with short- and long-term devastating consequences. Anti-bullying interventions are usually effective in reducing bullying, although the effect sizes are small and depend on the components of the programs. Bullying and cyberbullying evaluation strategies need to be improved. Findings are discussed introducing also the Special Issue on Bullying, Cyberbullying and Youth Violence: Facts, Prevention and Intervention.\n\xc2\xa9 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction\nSchool bullying is a repeated violence intentionally perpetrated by some students on other physically or psychologically weaker peers (Smith & Brain, 2000) under a so-called dominance\xe2\x80\x93submission scheme and law of silence (Ortega, 2010). This kind of abuse is present in schools all over the world (Craig et al., 2009). Consequences of being in- volved in bullying as victims, perpetrators, or both are very serious and affect individuals and societies (Farrington, Losel, Ttofi, & Theodorakis, 2012). Interventions are being conducted all over the world (Ttofi & Farrington, 2011), but the problem still persists and is now present not only in schools but also in cyberspace being called cyberbullying (e.g. Kowalski, Giumetti, Schroeder, & Lattanner, 2014). The latter has been defined as usually repeated aggressive and hostile messages inten- tionally sent though electronic media (Tokunaga, 2010).\nRapid development of information and communication technol- ogies, together with other factors, has led to an exponential increase in the number of studies available to the scientific community (Bornmann & Mutz, in press). Bibliographical sources needed for the constructions of theoretical frameworks and design of new re- search can be easily accessed anytime and anywhere in the world. Sophisticated software makes possible introduction of thousands of data points in few hours and skilled researchers are able to per- form complex analyses in less than a week. Pressure on publishing in most of the research institutions is high (Teelken & Lomas, 2009) and updated reports of new findings on different topics are released every day. Research on bullying and cyberbullying is no exception as can be seen on the example of a Web of Science search with 44 results in 1995, 165 results in 2005, or 689 results in 2014 with a total number of about 11,000 articles. Even though thousands of studies on bullying and cyberbullying have been published throughout the history of the field, this kind of violence still persists. Moreover, there are still impor- tant gaps in knowledge on the phenomena.\nAlthough bullying is present all over the world, there are big differ- ences in its prevalence ranging from 8.6% to 45.2% in boys, and from 4.8% to 35.8% in girls, with higher perpetration rates among boys and more victimization among girls in 70% of the countries and showing de- crease with age in about two thirds of the countries (Craig et al., 2009). For cyberbullying, rates as high as 72% (Juvoven & Gross, 2008) and as low as 6.5% (Ybarra & Mitchell, 2004) have been reported. Moreover, it is unclear whether cyberbullying is just a form of bullying (Olweus, 2013) or should be considered a new and different phenomenon con- sidering its specific features (Slonje, Smith, & Frisen, 2013). Involvement of minorities is also unclear, with some studies reporting more involved in bullying than the majority groups (e.g. Fandrem, Strohmeier, & Roland, 2009; Rodri\xcc\x81guez-Hidalgo, Ortega-Ruiz, & Zych, 2014) and others finding no difference between the two (e.g. Seals & Young, 2003). Risk and protective factors, together with outcomes, are broadly studied (e.g. Cook, Williams, Guerra, Kim, & Sadek, 2010; Hawker & Boulton, 2000; Kowalski et al., 2014), but it still needs to be confirmed which have the biggest impact on students involved in bullying and cyberbullying. Finally, anti-bullying programs are being implemented all over the world (Farrington & Ttofi, 2009), but not all of them are effective and some components seem to produce better results than\nothers. Evaluation strategies and methodologies in the field also vary (Vivolo-Kantor, Martell, Holland, & Westby, 2014). Clarifying all these issues would be useful for further advancement of studies on bullying and cyberbullying.\nA valuable solution to this situation can be found in synthesizing em- pirical knowledge through literature reviews (Cooper, 2009). Although classical literature narrative reviews provide valuable knowledge of dif- ferent topics, systematic reviews and meta-analyses give more objective and, therefore, less biased information (Johnson & Eagly, 2000). These kinds of studies are very useful in gathering the information on inter- vention programs and also on naturally occurring predictors and out- comes of different phenomena (Murray, Farrington, & Eisner, 2009). To our knowledge, findings of these theoretical studies in the field have not yet been systematically reviewed although Ttofi, Eisner, and Bradshaw (2014) described and analyzed systematic reviews and meta-analyses of anti-bullying programs and Jime\xcc\x81nez Barbero, Ruiz Herna\xcc\x81ndez, Llor Esteban, and Pe\xcc\x81rez Garci\xcc\x81a (2012) analyzed five meta- analyses on school bullying and violence prevention. Farrington, Losel and Ttofi (in press) conducted a systematic review on community- based programs to prevent antisocial behavior. This article, on the other hand, reports a systematic review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses on bullying and cyberbullying. It has been conducted to fill the gaps in knowledge on the topic providing a global panorama based on research syntheses.\n2. Method\n2.1. Aims of the study\nThe aim of the study was to conduct a systematic review of system- atic reviews and meta-analyses of research about bullying and cyberbullying. Specifically, this study pursued\n- to review the topics and the main findings of the review studies about bullying and cyberbullying;\n- tosynthetizeknowledgederivedfromtheoreticalstudiesaboutbul- lying and cyberbullying taking into account prevalence, age, and sex differences, possible overlap between the two phenomena, involve- ment of minorities, risk, and protective factors, consequences, effec- tiveness of anti-bullying programs and evaluation strategies;\n- tosynthetizeandanalyzeeffectsizesofthereviewedmeta-analyses.\n2.2. Search strategies\nSearch was conducted between June and August 2015 in the follow- ing databases: Google Scholar, Sciencedirect, Web of Science, Medline (through Web of Knowledge), PsychInfo, Campbell Library, Cochrane Li- brary, and Wiley Online Library. Aggression and Violent Behavior was also searched given the high number of review articles on the topic pub- lished in the journal. Also, the references of the articles included in the current study were searched for possible additional documents.\nKeywords and search strategies depended on the search engines of each database and were chosen with the objective of locating maximum numbers of studies. Thus, searches needed to be wide enough to locate\nall the potentially includable papers and, at the same time, restrictive enough to locate only relevant documents. For that reason, searches were restricted to titles in databases where all-field searches would pro- duce hundreds of thousands of records (i.e. Google Scholar). In engines where searches in titles could be combined with all fields or topics (i.e. Sciencedirect, Web of Knowledge, Wiley Online Library) keywords were entered assuming that bullying or cyberbullying would appear in titles and the type of the study (systematic review or meta-analysis) in other parts of the document or vice versa. On the other hand, in search engines that produce numbers of relevant records possible to scan and analyze (i.e. PsychInfo), less restricted searches were conducted in some cases including even all the articles on bullying and cyberbullying (i.e. Aggression and Violent Behavior, Campbell and Cochrane libraries). No time restrictions were introduced and, whenever possible, searches were restricted to journal articles.\nIn Google Scholar, keywords such as \xe2\x80\x9cbullying,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cbully,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ccyberbullying\xe2\x80\x9d combined with \xe2\x80\x9creview,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cmeta-analysis,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmeta- analytic\xe2\x80\x9d were searched in titles (\xe2\x80\x9callintitle\xe2\x80\x9d: function) yielding a total number of 452 results. \xe2\x80\x9cBullying\xe2\x80\x9d/\xe2\x80\x9ccyberbullying\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9creview\xe2\x80\x9d/ \xe2\x80\x9dmeta-analysis\xe2\x80\x9d/\xe2\x80\x9dmeta-analytic\xe2\x80\x9d were introduced interchangeably in titles and in all fields (e.g. \xe2\x80\x9cbullying" in title and \xe2\x80\x9cmeta-analysis\xe2\x80\x9d in all fields and then \xe2\x80\x9cmeta-analysis\xe2\x80\x9d in title and \xe2\x80\x9cbullying\xe2\x80\x9d in all fields), in Sciencedirect (341 records), Web of Knowledge including all the databases (158 records) and Wiley Online Library (255 records). In PsychInfo, \xe2\x80\x9cbullying\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccyberbullying\xe2\x80\x9d were combined with \xe2\x80\x9csys- tematic review\xe2\x80\x9d/\xe2\x80\x9dmeta-analysis\xe2\x80\x9d/\xe2\x80\x9cmeta-analytic\xe2\x80\x9d in journal articles\xe2\x80\x94all fields with a total number of 109 records. \xe2\x80\x9cBullying\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccyberbullying\xe2\x80\x9d were introduced in all fields in Aggression and Violent Behavior (172 re- cords), Campbell library (23 records), and Cochrane library (35 records). Thus, a total number of 1545 records were scanned (including repeti- tions). In all the cases, titles were scanned and if potentially includable, abstracts and full texts were analyzed. Among all these studies, 66 studies met the inclusion criteria.\n2.3. Inclusion criteria\n- Articles which review empirical research focusing specifically on peer victimization, bullying or cyberbullying were included, exclud- ing studies that would focus on school violence (unspecific) and re- views on bullying or cyberbullying mixed with other phenomena (e.g. Jime\xcc\x81nez Barbero et al., 2012, or Mishna, Cook, Saini, Wu, & MacFadden, 2009, who reviewed studies on cyber-abuse in gen- eral including only one research on cyberbullying).\n- Only systematic reviews were included defined as reviews with systematic or semi-systematic search in databases and possible other sources (e.g. references) performed with keywords includ- ing bullying or cyberbullying together with explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria. The studies might or might not include effect size calculations (meta-analyses) and searches were always con- ducted with the purpose of locating all the relevant studies on the topic within established time periods. Articles were excluded when there was no description of inclusion/exclusion criteria (e.g. Liu & Graves, 2011), or the description indicated clearly un- specific criteria (e.g. the inclusion criterion is the presence of the keywords in titles or abstracts\xe2\x80\x94Salgado, Senra, & Lourenc\xcc\xa7o, 2014) or search strategies.\n- Bullying and cyberbullying were perpetrated by children, adoles- cents, or youth in school settings, excluding studies on bullying, for example, at work. Reviews that included workplace and school bul- lying in the same analyses were also excluded (e.g. Nielsen, Tangenc, Idsoe, Matthiesen, & Mager\xc3\xb8y, 2015).\n- Articles were written in English or Spanish.\n- In order to guarantee the quality, only peer-reviewed documents\nsuch as journal articles and Campbell and Cochrane reports were included, excluding meeting abstracts, proceeding (except those published in Procedia since it is peer-reviewed) master\'s degree or\ndoctoral degree dissertations, other technical reports, and similar documents. The authors of the current review are aware of the fact that some very high-quality reports have been excluded (e.g. Farrington et al., 2012; Ttofi, Farrington, & Baldry, 2008), but most of the findings were also published in peer-reviewed journals and, therefore, included in the current review.\n2.4. Coding strategies\nIncluded studies were analyzed and coded reporting databases where searches were conducted, numbers of articles included in each review, the main topics and the main findings. For meta-analyses, over- all effect sizes for the most important variables were included. Finally, results were described synthesizing the findings of all the included arti- cles grouping the common topics.\nThe Results section shows overall effect sizes reported in each meta- analysis together with its interpretation based on Cohen (1988), Cooper (2009), and Lipsey and Wilson (2001) recommendations. Effect sizes were considered small for r = .10\xe2\x80\x93.24, OR = 1.50\xe2\x80\x932.49, d or g = .20\xe2\x80\x93.49; medium for r = .25\xe2\x80\x93.39, OR = 2.50\xe2\x80\x934.49 d or g = .50\xe2\x80\x93.79 and large r N .40 or OR N 4.30, d or g = N .80. These metrics are provided as in the original studies with confidence intervals if available. Modera- tion effects were described for each study, but metrics were not provid- ed due to the space limitations.\nFirst, results from meta-analyses are presented giving the strongest evidence of their results. Then, in each section, complementary informa- tion is added from systematic reviews which did not include a meta- analysis. Overall metrics, frequencies, or description are provided when available.\n3. Results\nA total number of 66 systematic reviews and meta-analyses were included in the current study. Results are presented first taking into account meta-analytic research and then adding information from non-meta-analytic systematic reviews.\nTable 1 shows the meta-analyses and Table 2 shows non-meta- analytic systematic reviews included in the current study. Tables focus on the sources from which the primary studies were extracted in each systematic review and meta-analysis, the number of research papers in- cluded in each study, the main topics together with the main findings and conclusions. Synthesis of the most important findings is included below taking into account the main topics of each theoretical study.\n3.1. Prevalence, sex, and age of the children involved in the phenomena\n3.1.1. Meta-analytic results\nPrevalence of bullying and cyberbullying was reported by Modecki et al. (2014) taking into account results from 80 studies. For bullying, mean prevalence rates for perpetration were of 35% (95% CI: .34\xe2\x80\x93.35) and for victimization of 36% (95% CI: .36\xe2\x80\x93.36). For cyberbullying, mean perpetration rate was of 16% (95% CI: .15\xe2\x80\x93.16) and mean victimization rate was of 15% (95% CI: .15\xe2\x80\x93.15). Higher rates were found when a clear definition was provided and terms \xe2\x80\x9cfun\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ctease\xe2\x80\x9d were included. Lower rates were found when behavioral examples (except for tradi- tional perpetration when behavioral examples were related to higher rates) or the term \xe2\x80\x9cbully\xe2\x80\x9d were included in the measure and in studies with imposed randomization.\nA meta-analysis of 109 studies conducted by Barlett and Coyne (2014) shows that cyberbullying perpetration was more common in boys than in girls, but the overall effect size was trivial (r = .04, 95% CI: .03\xe2\x80\x93.04). The authors report significant moderating effect of age showing that more girls were involved in cyberbullying perpetration in younger samples and more boys were involved in older samples, al- though no cut-off point could be calculated due to the continuous\nI.

Age moderated the effect size\xe2\x80\x94more girls than boys were involved in cyberbullying in younger samples and the opposite was true for older participants. Countries and continents in which studies were conducted also moderated effect sizes finding that boys cyberbullied more in some countries or continents (e.g. the USA, Germany, or Turkey) or no sex difference (e.g. in Canada or Australia).\nThe most important individual predictors of involvement in perpetration were externalizing behavior (e.g. undercontrolled aggressive response) (r = .34, 95% CI: .30\xe2\x80\x93.38) and other-related cognitions (e. g perspective taking or normative beliefs about others) (r = \xe2\x88\x92.34, 95% CI: \xe2\x80\x93.26 to \xe2\x88\x92.41); in victimization were social competence (r = \xe2\x88\x92.30, 95% CI: \xe2\x80\x93.22 to \xe2\x88\x92.38) and internalizing problems (e.g. withdrawn or depressive response)\n(r = .25, 95% CI: .20\xe2\x80\x93.28) and in being a bully/victim were self-related cognitions (e.g. self-respect or self-esteem) (r = \xe2\x88\x92.40, 95% CI: \xe2\x80\x93.29 to \xe2\x88\x92.50) and social competence (r = \xe2\x88\x92.36 95% CI: \xe2\x80\x93.28 to \xe2\x88\x92.45). Among the contextual predictors, the most important for perpetration were peer influence (r = \xe2\x88\x92.34, 95% CI: \xe2\x80\x93.26 to \xe2\x88\x92.42) and community factors (r = \xe2\x88\x92.22, 95%CI: \xe2\x88\x92.14 to \xe2\x88\x92.29); for victimization were peer status (r = \xe2\x88\x92.35, 95% CI: \xe2\x80\x93.28 to \xe2\x88\x92.41) and school climate (r = \xe2\x88\x92.16, 95% CI: \xe2\x80\x93.10 to \xe2\x88\x92.21) and for bully/victims were peer status (r = \xe2\x88\x92.36, 95%\nCI: \xe2\x80\x93.23 to \xe2\x88\x92.49) and peer influence (r = \xe2\x88\x92.44, no CI reported)\nChildren who experience bullying are more likely to show psychotic symptoms later in life than their uninvolved peers (OR = 2.15, 95% CI: 1.14\xe2\x80\x934.04).\nOverall, programs are effective in reducing bullying perpetration (OR = 1.36, 95% CI: 1.26\xe2\x80\x931.47) and victimization (OR = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.18\xe2\x80\x931.42) with small but substantial effect sizes. The most important elements related to decrease in bullying were parent and teacher trainings, supervision in the playground, disciplinary methods, classroom management and rules, whole-school universal policy against bullying, conferences in school, cooperative group work and providing information to parents. Decrease in bullying was also related to the number of elements, duration and intensity of the programs. Results were better with older children. Work with peers was related to increased victimization.\nVerbal and sexually charged victimization was more frequent in GLB group when compared to the majority group (OR = 2.24, 95% CI: 1.63\xe2\x80\x933.08). The same was true for physical and sexual victimization (OR = 1.82, 95% CI: 1.29\xe2\x80\x932.58). Psychological outcomes such as suicide ideation or attempt, sexual and physical abuse, substance use and mental health issues; social outcomes such as perception of hostile school climate and lack of social support were more common in GLB compared to the heterosexual youth. Physical outcomes were the same for GLB and heterosexual participants.\nPrograms produce positive results (adjusted r = .12, 95% CI: .08\xe2\x80\x93.17) but the size of the effect is small with 1% impact for low-risk participants and 3.6% for high-risk participants. At-risk status moderates the effect. Longitudinal studies show that psychosomatic problems are more common among victimized students compared to non-victimized peers (OR = 2.39, 95% CI: 1.76\xe2\x80\x933.24). Cross-sectional studies show similar pattern (OR = 2.17, 95% CI: 1.91\xe2\x80\x932.46), although effect size decreased for studies with more females.\nBullying (r = .25; 95% CI: .17\xe2\x80\x93.32) and cyberbullying (r = .31; 95% CI: .27\xe2\x80\x93.36) perpetration are related to moral disengagement.\n Cunningham, Hoy, and Shannon (2015)\nFarrington & Ttofi, 2009;Ttofi and Farrington (2011)1\nFedewa and Ahn (2011)\nFerguson, Miguel, Kilburn, and Sanchez (2007)\nGini and Pozzoli (2009)2\nGini, Pozzoli, and Hymel, (2014)3\nPsychINFO, Web of Science, and PubMed\nAustralian Criminology Database (CINCH), Australian Education Index, British Educa- tion Index, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, C2-SPECTR, Criminal Justice Abstracts, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE), Dissertation Abstracts, Educational Resources Informa- tion Clearinghouse (ERIC), EMBASE, Google Scholar, Index to Theses Database, MEDLINE, National Criminal Justice, Reference Service (NCJRS), PsychInfo/Psychlit, Sociological Abstracts, Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI), Web of Knowledge; names of the recognized researchers, 35 journals and meetings with colleagues\nPsychLit, PsycINFO, Dissertation Abstracts, MEDLINE, ERIC, Google Scholar, and literature reviews.\nPsycINFO and the references of the selected articles\nPsycINFO, PubMed, the Cochrane Library, the Campbell Collaboration, and Scopus together with \xe2\x80\x9ccited by\xe2\x80\x9d function in Scopus, review articles and references\nPsychInfo, Educational Research Information Center, Scopus, Google Scholar, review articles, references and direct contact with\n10 Bullying as a cause of psychotic symptoms analyzing research with prospective designs focusing on the most severe and enduring symptoms.\n89 Effectiveness of programs to reduce bullying including 53 evaluations (published in 89 reports) taking into account research designs and other characteristics of the evaluation (sample size, publication dates, participants \xcc\x81 age, location and outcome measures), the most important elements of the programs.\n18 Frequency and the effect of victimization on sexual-minority group compared to the majority group paying attention to psychological, physical, and social outcomes.\n45 Effectiveness of anti-bullying programs considering also moderator analyses.\n30 Relationship between victimization and psychosomatic problems considering cross-sectional and longitudinal research.\n15 Relationship between bullying and cyberbullying perpetration with moral disengagement.\n \nTable 1 (continued) Study\nGini, Pozzoli, Lenzi, and Vieno, (2014)\nHawker and Boulton (2000)\nHolt et al.

For the latter, the magnitude of the effect size decreased for studies with more females.\nVictimization was significantly related to depression\n(r = .45 with shared method variance and r = .29 with no shared method variance), loneliness (r = .32 with shared method variance and r = .25 with no shared method variance), generalized and social anxiety (r = .25 with shared method variance and r = .19 with no shared method variance), general self-esteem (r = .39 with shared method variance and r = .21 with no shared method variance) and social-esteem (r = .35 with shared method variance and r = .23 with no shared method variance). No confidence intervals were reported. Significant relations were found between victimization and suicidal ideation (OR = 2.34; 95% CI: 2.03\xe2\x80\x932.69) and behavior (OR = 2.94; 95% CI: 2.36\xe2\x80\x933.67), perpetration and ideation (OR = 2.12; 95% CI: 1.67\xe2\x80\x932.69) and behavior (OR = 2.62; 95% CI: 1.51\xe2\x80\x934.55) and also being a bully/victim and ideation (OR = 3.81; 95% CI: 2.13\xe2\x80\x936.80) or behavior (OR = 4.02; 95% CI: 2.39\xe2\x80\x936.76).\nBesides cybervictimization (r = .51, 95% CI: .48\xe2\x80\x93.55) and traditional bullying (r = .45, 95% CI: .41\xe2\x80\x93.48), the most important risk factors for cyberbullying perpetration were normative beliefs about aggression (r = .37, 95% CI: .24\xe2\x80\x93.48) and moral disengagement (r = .27, 95% CI: .20\xe2\x80\x93.34). School safety (r = \xe2\x88\x92.13, 95% CI: \xe2\x80\x93.16 to \xe2\x80\x93.10), empathy (r = \xe2\x88\x92.12, 95% CI: \xe2\x80\x93.14 to \xe2\x80\x93.09) and school climate\n(r = \xe2\x88\x92.12, 95% CI: \xe2\x80\x93.14 to \xe2\x80\x93.10) were the most important protective factors. Drug and alcohol use was the most important outcome (r = .27, 95% CI: .22\xe2\x80\x93.31). For cybervictimization, besides traditional victimization\n(r = .40, 95% CI: .37\xe2\x80\x93.42) and bullying (r = .25, 95% CI: .23\xe2\x80\x93.28), anger (r = .20, 95% CI: .16\xe2\x80\x93.23) and risky online behavior (r = .18, 95% CI: .14\xe2\x80\x93.21) were the most important risk factors, school safety the most important protective factor (r = \xe2\x88\x92.22, 95% CI: \xe2\x80\x93.24 to \xe2\x80\x93.19) and stress\n(r = .34, 95% CI: .29\xe2\x80\x93.38) and suicidal ideation (r = .27, 95% CI: .24\xe2\x80\x93.31) were the most important outcomes. Anti-bullying programs had significant but rather small effect on victimization (d = .15, 95% CI: .20\xe2\x80\x93.10). Considering different program strategies, moderate overall effect size was achieved for training in emotional control (d = .46). The rest of the effect sizes were rather small.\nVictimization was related to less positive parenting\n(g = \xe2\x88\x92.19; 95% CI: \xe2\x80\x93.23 to \xe2\x88\x92.15) being less likely to live with authoritative parents, with less communication, supervision, warmth and affection or parental support. Victimization was also related to more negative parenting (g = .26; 95% CI: .16\xe2\x80\x93.37) with more abuse and neglect, maladaptive parenting and overprotection.\nFocusing on variables specifically regarding involvement in bullying reported through self-reports, small but meaningful changes were found in positive attitudes toward bullying (d = .15) victimization (d = .27), witnessing bullying (d = .35) and intervention to stop it (d = .17). Teacher reports showed small effects on witnessed students being bullied (d = \xe2\x88\x92.16), staff response (d = .30) and attitudes about school safety\n(d = .16) and large effects for knowledge on bullying prevention (d = 1.52) and intervention skills (d = .99). Peer-reports showed small effect on participation in bullying roles (d = .32). No meaningful effect sizes (below .15) were found in the rest of the outcomes. No confidence intervals were reported. The authors conclude that the impact of the programs on actual bullying behavior is low.\nThe strongest relationships were found between bullying perpetration and, agreeableness (r = \xe2\x88\x92.24, 95% CI: \xe2\x88\x92.31 to \xe2\x88\x92.17), conscientiousness (r = \xe2\x88\x92.15, 95% CI: \xe2\x88\x92.23 to\nI.

For victimization, the strongest relationships were found with neuroticism (r = .24, 95% CI: .18\xe2\x80\x93.29). Weighted mean prevalence rates for traditional perpetration was of 35% (95% CI: .34\xe2\x80\x93.35), traditional victimization was of 36% (95% CI: .36\xe2\x80\x93.36), cyber-perpetration was of 16% (95% CI: .15\xe2\x80\x93.16) and cybervictimization was of 15% (95% CI: .15\xe2\x80\x93.15). Higher prevalence rates are found when a clear definition of the phenomena is provided, behavioral examples are related to lower rates (except for traditional perpetration where they are higher). Including the word \xe2\x80\x9cbully\xe2\x80\x9d is related to lower rates, including words \xe2\x80\x9ctease\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cfun\xe2\x80\x9d relates to higher rates. Randomization is related to lower rates. Medium to strong correlations were found between cyberbullying and bullying perpetration (r = .47, 95% CI: .47\xe2\x80\x93.47) and victimization (r = .40, 95% CI: .40\xe2\x80\x93.41)\nThere is a weak but significant negative relationship between peer victimization and academic achievement\n(r = \xe2\x88\x92.12; 95% CI: \xe2\x80\x93.15 to \xe2\x88\x92.09). There is no difference between boys and girls and this relationship is mediated by methodologies of the studies (e.g. informants or indicators).\nPrograms had positive small effect on bystander intervention (g = .20, 95% CI: .11\xe2\x80\x93.29), greater in high school compared to primary schools, greater when facilitators were other than the teachers (researchers, counselors or software). The programs had very small effects on empathy (g = .05, 95% CI: .07\xe2\x80\x93.17). Victimization significantly predicts internalizing problems over time (r = .18, 95% CI = .12\xe2\x80\x93.24) and, on the other hand, internalizing problems significantly predict victimization over time (r = .08, 95% CI .01\xe2\x80\x93.16), although the effect size was very small for the latter.\nVictimization significantly predicts externalizing problems over time (r = .14, 95% CI: .09\xe2\x80\x93.19) and, on the other hand, externalizing problems significantly predict victimization over time (r = .13, 95% CI: .04\xe2\x80\x93.21). Victimization was positively related to low socioeconomic status (OR = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.36\xe2\x80\x931.71) and negatively related to high socioeconomic status (OR = .73, 95% CI: .63\xe2\x80\x93.86). Similar results were found for perpetration and socioeconomic status (low\xe2\x80\x94OR =1.14, 95% CI: 1.02\xe2\x80\x931.27 and high\xe2\x80\x94OR = .89, 95% CI: .83\xe2\x80\x93.95). Being a bully-victim was only positively related to low socioeconomic status (OR = 1.71, 95% CI: 1.22\xe2\x80\x932.39). Some of these associations become much weaker when adjusted for publication bias.\nPerpetration was an important predictor of violence later in life (adjusted OR = 2.04; 95% CI: 1.69\xe2\x80\x932.45). The effect size was negatively related to the age of perpetration assessment, the age of outcome assessment and the length of follow-ups (the effects of perpetration seem to decrease with time but early exposure predicts higher risk). Victimization was also a predictor of later violence, although with smaller effect size (adjusted OR = 1.42; 95% CI: 1.25\xe2\x80\x931.62) and no moderators were significant.\nBullying perpetrators are at higher risk for drug use (OR = 2.22, 95% CI: 1.60\xe2\x80\x933.07) although much variation is explained by other factors such as childhood individual, family and school risk (adjusted OR = 1.41, 95% CI 1.20\xe2\x80\x931.66). Victimization did not predict drug use later in life (adjusted OR = 1.02; 95% CI: .94\xe2\x80\x931.11).\nVictimization is a predictor of depression later in life (adjusted OR = 1.99; 95% CI: 1.71\xe2\x80\x932.32).

The effect size was still strong after controlling for other risk factors.\nBullying perpetration predicts offending later in life (adjusted OR = 2.50; 95% CI: 2.03\xe2\x80\x933.08. This effect size was positively related to the age of bullying evaluation and negatively related to the length of the follow-ups and the outcome measures (stronger effect of perpetration in the short term). The effect size was still strong after controlling for other risk factors. Victimization is related to the development of psychotic symptoms in general population (adjusted OR = 2.3 95% CI: 1.5\xe2\x80\x933.4). This relationship seems to be stronger with increased duration, frequency and severity. Results of clinical samples are mixed and data not appropriate for a meta-analysis.\nPeer- victimization is more common among youth with overweight (OR = 1.19; 95% CI: 1.10\xe2\x80\x931.29)and obesity (OR = 1.51; 95% CI: 1.34\xe2\x80\x931.72) problems in comparison to their normal-weight peers.\nVictimization is related to weapon carrying (adjusted OR = 1.95; 95% CI: 1.60\xe2\x80\x932.36) with no significant moderators. Perpetration is also related to weapon carrying (adjusted OR = 2.30; 95% CI: 1.90\xe2\x80\x932.77) with stronger effect size in studies with higher response rate (above 75%) and no other significant moderators. No differences were found between the U.S. studies and research from other countries for victims and perpetrators. Very strong relations were found between being a bully/victim and weapon carrying (OR = 4.95; 95% CI: 3.77\xe2\x80\x936.50) stronger for the studies conducted in the U.S. in comparison to other countries.\nPeer victimization was related to suicidal ideation (adjusted OR = 2.18, 95% CI: 2.05\xe2\x80\x932.32) with stronger effect for cyberbullying (OR =3.12, 95% CI: 2.40\xe2\x80\x934.05) than for traditional bullying (OR = 2.16, 95% CI: 2.05\xe2\x80\x932.28) with no other significant moderators. Peer victimization was also related to suicidal attempts (OR = 2.55; 95% CI: 1.95\xe2\x80\x933.34) with no significant moderators and no separate analysis for traditional vs. cyberbullying due to the low number of studies. Sleeping problems are more common among peer victimized children if compared to non-victimized peers (OR = 2.21; 95% CI: 2.01\xe2\x80\x932.44). This relationship is stronger in younger children.\nThere was no difference in peer victimization suffered by majority and minority groups taking into account all the studies (d = .01, 95% CI: \xe2\x80\x93.09 to.10) and majority suffered more victimization in the US in comparison to the minorities (d = .23; 95% CI: .22\xe2\x80\x93.44) and minorities suffered more victimization if compared to the majority in the UK (d = .16; 95% CI: .02\xe2\x80\x93.35). Very small overall effect sizes (d b .1) were found in comparison between specific groups although some of them were stronger for some age groups or measures.\nAnti-bullying programs in older adolescents are less effective than in younger participants (correlation between effect size and age: simple\xe2\x80\x94r = \xe2\x88\x92.20 and within-study\xe2\x80\x94r = \xe2\x88\x92.43). A three-level meta-analysis with within-study analysis shows that there is a non-linear discontinuity in relation to age. The effect in grades 1\xe2\x80\x937 was small (d = .13, no CI reported) and in grades 8+ the programs were ineffective (d = .01, no CI reported) with a significant decline in grades 7th to 12th (b = \xe2\x88\x92.06, Z = 2.40, p = .016). Thus, programs \xcc\x81 effectiveness show slight increase between 1st and 7th grade and then decline from 7th to 12th grade so that after the 10th grade the effects might possibly even become iatrogenic (not significant on average but significant in some studies).\nI.

Risk and protective fac- tors are mainly related to other kinds of violence, family structure, substance use, self-efficacy and beliefs on aggression. Involvement in bullying is related to health issues such as depression and physical health.\nCyberbullying is an existing phenomenon in Greece, although research on the topic is still in its early stage of development. Most of the studies are descriptive, not specifically focused on the phenomenon and/or have small samples. Most of the data were collected by European and national institutions and not all the research has been published in scientific journals. More studies are needed.\nAbout half of the programs produce desirable results. Information on the effectiveness of different components is rarely available and, in general, the authors recommend improving designs and methodology used to clarify the effectiveness of the programs.\nThe concept of cyberbullying is not used in about half of the instruments and is operationalized differently throughout the instruments (e.g. including or not components such as intentionality, imbalance of power, repetition, etc.). Devices and media also vary among studies. Less than 30% of the studies performed factor analyses. Almost all the instruments are self-reports. Reliability and validity of the instruments are not fully reported.\nPrevalence rates and related variables differed among studies ranging from 6.5% to 72%. Involvement in cyberbullying was related to the involvement in traditional bullying. Cyberbullying was also related to emotional and psychosomatic difficulties.\nWhole-school interventions seem to be the most effective. In general, most of the programs are effective in the short term but their long-term effects are still unclear mostly because the reported follow-up periods seem to be short.\nThere is a great variability in research methodologies utilized in anti-bullying interventions.\nPeer victimization related to sexual orientation and gender identity/expression is related to negative outcomes such as lower sense of belonging to school, depressive symptoms and to suicidality according to some studies (mixed results in case of the latter) with some studies reporting also alcohol and substance use.\nAbout half of the studies report significant decrease in perpetration and almost 70% report significant decrease in victimization. There are differences in a way that the involvement is measured with studies utilizing multi-item and single-item instruments. It is recommended to improve measurement.\nIn most of the cases (7 out of 8), intervention programs are useful to decrease bullying behaviors. Main components and findings are described separately for each program.\nThe number and the quality of the studies on the topic are low. It seems that prevalence of bullying in deaf and hard of hearing students is higher than in the hearing children but more studies are needed to confirm it.\n  \nTable 2 (continued) Study\nHamm et al.

Zych et al. / Aggression and Violent Behavior 23 (2015) 1\xe2\x80\x9321\n9\n  The median prevalence of cyber-victimization was of 23% and of perpetration of 15.2%. Common forms of cyberbullying were insults/name-calling, rumors or circulating pictures. Most of the studies show that it occurs in similar age groups and increases with age being girls more victimized and with more perpetrators among boys. Results on the relationship with anxiety were inconsistent and the relationship with depression seems to be more evident.\nParents demand more information on the phenomenon. Their definitions are diverse with difficulties with distinguishing bullying from other behavior and normalizing it. The principal coping strategy is to help dealing with stress, some indirect and specific strategies and involving the school. Parents often felt negative emotions related to bullying and frequently were not fully aware of the situation. They perceive that school response should be improved.\nMixed methodology might provide new insights since some phenomena are difficult to describe only with qualitative or quantitative studies. Findings might be complimentary strengthening the results validity. Divergent results might lead to re-conceptualizations.\nStudies on bullying in Korea are related to microsystem components such as family, peers and school; mesosystem such as relationship between school and families (still understudied) and macrosystem concerning religion and policies.\nMost of the studies show increased suicidal ideation in victims, perpetrators and bully/victims from general population. Similar situation was found in victims from special education, although perpetrators from the group of juvenile offenders showed decreased risk. Increased risk of attempts were found in victims and bullies from general and special populations.\nMost of the cross-sectional studies show increased risk of suicidal ideation and attempt in bullies and victims. Most of the studies report stronger relation in females than males. Longitudinal studies are scarce, but also suggest increased risk for children involved in bullying with some particular issues related to sex. Contextual risk factors for bullying in school and classroom seem to be related to inequalities in income, poverty, lack of anti-bullying norms, deficient classroom management and teacher support. Results related to school and classroom size or location differed among studies. Inequalities in income and violence in the city or country were also related to bullying.\nTeachers employ broader definitions of bullying in comparison to students. Definitions included themes such as direct bullying, social exclusion, power imbalance, repetition, intending harm, how bullying affects the victim, sexualized bullying, focus on difference and coercion. Qualitative studies focus mostly on elaborating and explicating the experiences of children involved in bullying in their own words. Naturalistic inquiries in which researchers investigate themes when they emerge are common.\nPeer intervention and parental supervision and behavior seem to be useful in preventing cyberbullying. For combating the problem and buffering its effects, victims report confronting the perpetrators, technical solutions such as blocking are used together with seeking support from friends and ignoring the problem. Students are rather skeptical when seeking support from parents or teachers. Most of the studies focus on use of strategies and not on their success.\n (continued on next page)\n10\nI.

Teachers and students perceptions of perpetration vary among studies. Higher rates are observed in students with more severe disabilities. Victimization is related to character traits and ability to interpret social cues.\nProgram evaluations are deficient. Program monitoring related to verification of the implementations (e.g. adherence, quality of delivery or dosage) was absent in more than one third of the evaluations and the rest of the studies used on average only 1 method. None of the randomized controlled trials meet all the assumptions to be classified as such. Inclusion of qualitative methods is uncommon and the post-tests/follow-ups are short. Most studies use two or more evaluation methods but more than a half use only one informant. Effect sizes are rarely reported and hierarchical modeling is infrequent. Involvement in bullying is related to suicidal ideation and attempt. The risk seems to be higher in girls in comparison to boys.\nThe vast majority of effects are small, negligible and negative. Formal monitoring led to more positive outcomes for victimization.\nEvidence of physical victimization in shooters was found in 29.9% of the cases and in 31.2% it was explicitly excluded. Peer rejection was more frequent (53.7%) and explicitly excluded in 14.9%. In 13.4% of the cases, shooters were found to be perpetrators.\nVictimization rates vary among studies and are usually reported between 20% and 40%. It might occur in all age groups and findings on the relationship with age are inconsistent, although it seems to be curvilinear with the highest prevalence between 7th and 8th grades. Studies are also inconsistent in relation to gender with the majority of studies showing no sex differences. Negative consequences depend on severity, frequency and duration with most of the studies finding negative consequences on academic performance and psychosocial problems. Technical coping is common and passive strategies or reporting to adults are uncommon.\nMost of the studies (5 out of 7) found positive relationship between victimization and alcohol misuse.\nReview of the studies suggest that resilience after being involved in bullying as perpetrators or victims is related to high school achievement and social skills. Also strong family attachment and stable structure, together with social support and prosocial friends protect from developing problems later in life.\nPerpetration seems to be negatively related to cognitive and affective empathy, victimization to cognitive empathy only. Defending seems to be positively related to both cognitive and affective empathy whereas bystanding yields mixed results.\n  Topper & Conrod (in press)\nTtofi, Bowes, Farrington, and Lo\xcc\x88sel (2014)\nvan Noorden, Haselager, Cillessen, and Bukowski (2015)\n \nTable 2 (continued) Study\nVessey, Strout, DiFazio, and Walker (2014)\nDatabases and other sources N\nEBSCO search querying CINAHL, MEDLINE, ERIC and 31 PsychINFO.

(2014)\nVreeman and Carroll (2007)\nAmong the included instruments, 26% present test-retest reliability findings, 90% reported internal consistency reliability measures (with few studies reporting Cronbach\'s alphas below .70), 26% included item-total correlations. Content validity related to the item development procedure was reported in 48% of the studies, although without describing detailed procedure. Information related to floor-ceiling effect is almost completely absent. Factorial validity was reported in 65% of the studies. Construct validity (e.g. convergent, divergent) was present in 100% of the reports. Predictive validity measures are very scarce. Measurement invariance among groups was evaluated in 29%, 35% informed on the administration length and none reported the time needed for scoring.\nMeasurement strategies are inconsistent among studies. Self-reports are the most common instruments. Measured use varying terminology and most of them include physical and verbal bullying. About one fourth include definition of bullying and about one third include the word \xe2\x80\x9cbullying\xe2\x80\x9d. It is uncommon to include aspect such as repetition, power imbalance, aggression and intentional harm. All reported validity and reliability but with different statistics.\nCurriculum based programs reduced bullying in 4 out of 10 studies; whole-school multidisciplinary intervention reduced bullying in 7 out of 10 programs. No bullying reduction was found in 3 out of 4 social skills interventions. The mentoring study (1 out of 1) and social worker support (1 out of 1) yielded desirable results. There was a great variability among the programs within the categories in duration, implementation strategies, etc.\nI. Zych et al. / Aggression and Violent Behavior 23 (2015) 1\xe2\x80\x9321\n11\n   1Database list was extracted from the report published by Farrington et al. (2012) cited in the method section of the article for details on searches.\ndata. Also, countries and continents were found to be significant moder- ators, namely, boys cyberbullied more in some geographic zones and there were no sex differences in other zones. All the effect sizes were below .01 except for Germany (r = .18, 95% CI: .15\xe2\x80\x93.21).\nA broad meta-analysis on individual and contextual predictors of bullying including 153 studies conducted by Cook et al. (2010) found that more boys were involved in perpetration (r = .18, 95% CI: .15\xe2\x80\x93.23), victimization (r = .06, 95% CI: .05\xe2\x80\x93.10), or bully/victim status (r = .10, 95% CI: .04\xe2\x80\x93.12) with small effect sizes. Relationships between age and perpetration were weak (r = .09, 95% CI: .05\xe2\x80\x93.12) and absent for victimization (r = \xe2\x88\x92.01, 95% CI: .05\xe2\x80\x93.07) and bully/victim status (r = .01, 95% CI: .01\xe2\x80\x93.04).\nAnother broad meta-analysis conducted by Kowalski et al. (2014) who synthesized 131 studies on risk and protective factors and out- comes of cyberbullying included age, among other variables, in relation to perpetration and victimization. The results show weak observed cor- relation corrected for sample error for cyberbullying perpetration and age (r = .05, 95% CI: .03\xe2\x80\x93.08), and non-significant relationship with vic- timization (r = .01 95% CI: \xe2\x88\x92.01 to .04).\nMitsopoulou and Giovazolias (2015) also performed a meta- analysis on gender and age in relation to bullying. The study included 19 articles located by searches and inclusion/exclusion criteria focused on the relationship between personality variables and empathy with bullying. Results are presented as a forest plot with Hedge\'s g for 11 studies on victimization and/or perpetration but no overall effect size was calculated. More boys and girls were involved according to the results of 10 out of 11 studies. The results section also report that that younger children engage in more bullying behavior (B = \xe2\x88\x92.0169, p b .001, SE = .001) providing no further details.\n3.1.2. Additional information from non-meta-analytic systematic reviews\nA few systematic reviews focused on specific geographic zones such as Greece (Antoniadou & Kokkinos, 2015) or South Korea (Hong et al., 2014). The former concludes that cyberbullying is an existing but understudied phenomenon in Greece where research is mostly unspe- cific, descriptive, or with small samples. The latter is based on a holistic ecological framework showing that mesosystem variables are still understudied. Both articles include only narrative results and do not cal- culate common metrics.\nPrevalence was also reported in non-meta-analytic systematic re- views. Among them, Tokunaga (2010) found that the most frequent cybervictimization rates were between 20% and 40%, although rates as low as 6.5% and as high as 72% were also reported. The author attributed the variability mostly to differences in defining the phenomenon. Bottino et al. (2015) found very similar prevalence rates for cyberbullying ranging from 6.5% to 72%. Hamm et al. (2015) reported cyberbullying perpetration and victimization median rates of 15.2% and 23%, respectively.\nQualitative results reported by Hamm et al. (2015) show that 6 studies found that cyberbullying increased with age and 4 studies found no effect of age on this behavior. Rates of cybervictimization are found to be higher in girls (according to 7 studies vs. 2 studies with no sex-differences), whereas higher rates of cyber-perpetration were found in boys (3 studies vs. 0). Tokunaga (2010) includes a nar- rative description of contradictory findings across the reviewed studies and suggests a curvilinear relationship of cybervictimization prevalence with age with the highest rates between 7th and 8th grades. The majority of studies reviewed by this author found no dif- ferences in cybervictimization rates between girls and boys.\n12 I. Zych et al. / Aggression and Violent Behavior 23 (2015) 1\xe2\x80\x9321\n3.2. Relationship between bullying and cyberbullying: Meta-analytic results\nModecki et al. (2014) found large samplesize weighted mean rela- tionships between bullying and cyberbullying perpetration (r = .47, 95% CI: .47\xe2\x80\x93.47) and victimization (r = .40, 95% CI: .40\xe2\x80\x93.41) in a meta-analysis including 80 studies. Correlations were stronger for rela- tional perpetration, evaluations of perpetration that did not focus on school-centered traditional bullying and that did not impose randomi- zation. For victimization, stronger correlation was found for traditional measures of relational victimization than other types of victimization.\nKowalski et al. (2014) included 131 studies and found that after cybervictimization, traditional bullying perpetration was the most im- portant risk factor for cyberbullying perpetration (r = .45, 95% CI: .41\xe2\x80\x93.48) and, at the same time, traditional victimization was the stron- gest risk factor for cybervictimization (r = .40, 95% CI: .37\xe2\x80\x93.42). Corre- lation between cybervictimization and traditional victimization was lower for middle school and high school if compared to participants from middle and high schools included in the same sample. North American samples showed bigger effect sizes for the relationships of cybervictimization with bullying perpetration and victimization and cyberbullying with traditional bullying when compared to other geo- graphical zones. When the definition of bullying or the word \xe2\x80\x9cbully\xe2\x80\x9d was included in the assessment, correlations between cyberbullying and traditional victimization were smaller.\n3.3. Minorities\' involvement in bullying\n3.3.1. Meta-analytic results\nA meta-analysis conducted by Fedewa and Ahn (2011) included 18 studies on victimization in sexual-minority groups. It was found that sexually charged victimization was more frequent in sexual minority group when compared to the majority group (OR = 2.24, 95% CI = 1.63\xe2\x80\x933.08) with medium effect size. Also physical and sexual victimiza- tion was higher in sexual minorities but with a smaller effect size (OR = 1.82, 95% CI = 1.29\xe2\x80\x932.58). Outcomes of victimization were also experienced more among sexual minorities with the largest effects for physical and sexual abuse (OR = 3.47, 95% CI = 2.26\xe2\x80\x935.34), suicide attempt (OR = 2.41, 95% CI: 1.84\xe2\x80\x933.15), and ideation (OR = 2.17, 95% CI: 1.76\xe2\x80\x932.66).\nVan Geel et al. (2014a) synthesized findings from 16 studies on the relationship between overweight and obesity with peer victimization. Peer victimization was more common among overweight youth (OR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.10\xe2\x80\x932.22) and youth with obesity (OR = 1.51, 95% CI: 1.34\xe2\x80\x931.72) compared to the normal-weight peers with small ef- fect sizes. Results were not moderated by gender.\nEthnic differences in peer victimization were studied by Vitoroulis and Vaillancourt (2015) synthesizing the results of 105 studies. Overall effect size showed no difference in peer victimization suffered by major- ity and minority groups (d = .01, 95% CI: \xe2\x88\x92.09 to .10). Moderator analyses showed that majority suffered more victimization in the US in comparison to minorities (d = .23, 95% CI: .22\xe2\x80\x93.44) and minority suf- fered more victimization in the UK when compared to the minority (d = .16; 95% CI: .02\xe2\x80\x93.35) with rather small effect sizes. Dyadic compar- isons of different ethnic groups show small effect sizes (d b .1).\n3.3.2. Additional information from non-meta-analytic systematic reviews\nHamm et al. (2015) reviewed 7 studies on minorities\' involvement in cyberbullying with inconclusive results with some studies reporting only rates for ethnic minorities, some finding more cyberbullying among ethnic minorities, others among majorities, and 3 finding no eth- nic differences. These results are narrative.\nA non-meta-analytic systematic review on bullying among African Americans found that, according to the majority of the studies, its prevalence was higher in comparison to other students (Albdour & Krouse, 2014). Narrative results of higher prevalence of involvement in different roles, namely bullies, victims, or bully/victims are\ninconsistent throughout the literature. The authors narratively describe some risk and protective factors found among the reviewed studies such as other kinds of violence, family structure, substance use, self- efficacy, and beliefs on aggression. They also describe outcomes such as depression and physical health issues.\nNarrative results of another non-meta-analytic systematic review led to the conclusion that peer victimization related to sexual orienta- tion or gender identity/expression (Collier et al., 2013) is related to lower sense of belonging to school, higher depressive symptoms, dis- ruptions in educational trajectories, traumatic stress, and alcohol and substance use. Results on suicidality were inconclusive. Another sys- tematic review with narrative results examined bullying and cyberbullying in deaf and hearing-impaired students (Hadjikakou & Papas, 2012), suggesting higher prevalence in comparison to the hear- ing peers. Nevertheless, results show that most of these studies are qualitative or with small samples and, therefore, did not allow firm con- clusions. Rose et al. (2011) found that the majority of studies on bully- ing victimization among children with disabilities found higher rates in comparison to the nondisabled students. Research in inclusive settings found similar rates between students with and without disabilities.\n3.4. Risk and protective factors\n3.4.1. Meta-analytic results\nTable 3 shows risk and protective factors for bullying and cyberbullying with small, medium, and large effect sizes.\nThe meta-analysis conducted by Cook et al. (2010) including 153 studies divided predictors of bullying into individual and contextual factors. The authors found that, besides gender and age (included in a different section), individual predictors of perpetration were (ordered by the effect sizes) externalizing behavior (r = .34, 95% CI: .30\xe2\x80\x93.38) and other-related cognitions (e.g. perspective taking or normative beliefs about others) (r = \xe2\x88\x92.34, 95% CI: \xe2\x88\x92.26 to \xe2\x88\x92.41), academic per- formance (r = \xe2\x88\x92.21, 95% CI: \xe2\x88\x92.17 to \xe2\x88\x92.25), social problem solving (r = \xe2\x88\x92.17, 95% CI: \xe2\x88\x92.11 to \xe2\x88\x92.22), internalizing behavior (r = .12, 95% CI: .06\xe2\x80\x93.17), and social competence (r = \xe2\x88\x92.12, 95% CI: \xe2\x88\x92.05 to \xe2\x88\x92.19), and self-related cognitions (r = \xe2\x88\x92 07, 95% CI: \xe2\x88\x92.02 to \xe2\x88\x92.14). Individual predictors of victimization were social competence (r = \xe2\x88\x92.30, 95% CI: \xe2\x88\x92.22 to \xe2\x88\x92.38), internalizing problems (r = .25, 95% CI: .20\xe2\x80\x93.28), self- related cognitions (r = \xe2\x88\x92.16, 95% CI: \xe2\x88\x92.10 to \xe2\x88\x92.21), social problem solving (r = \xe2\x88\x92.13, 95% CI: \xe2\x88\x92.06 to \xe2\x88\x92.18), externalizing behavior (r = .12, 95% CI: .10\xe2\x80\x93.16), and academic performance (r = \xe2\x88\x92.04, 95% CI: \xe2\x88\x92.01 to \xe2\x88\x92.08). Bully/victim status was predicted by individual fac- tors such as self-related cognitions (e.g. self-respect or self-esteem) (r = \xe2\x88\x92.40, 95% CI: \xe2\x88\x92.29 to \xe2\x88\x92.50), social-competence (r = \xe2\x88\x92.36, 95% CI: \xe2\x88\x92.28 to \xe2\x88\x92.45), externalizing behavior (r = .33, 95% CI: .18\xe2\x80\x93.48), and academic performance (r = \xe2\x88\x92.32, no CI reported), internalizing be- havior (r = .22, 95% CI: .12\xe2\x80\x93.33), other related cognitions (r = \xe2\x88\x92.20, no CI reported) and social problem solving (r = \xe2\x88\x92.18, 95% CI: \xe2\x88\x92.06 to \xe2\x88\x92.30). Contextual predictors for perpetration were peer influence (r = \xe2\x88\x92.34, 95% CI: \xe2\x88\x92.26 to \xe2\x88\x92.42), community factors (r = \xe2\x88\x92.22, 95% CI: \xe2\x88\x92.14 to \xe2\x88\x92.29), school climate (r = \xe2\x88\x92.18, 95% CI: \xe2\x88\x92.12 to \xe2\x88\x92.23), family/home environment (r = \xe2\x88\x92.17, 95% CI: \xe2\x88\x92.13 to \xe2\x88\x92.20), and peer status (r = \xe2\x88\x92.10, 95% CI: \xe2\x88\x92.06 to \xe2\x88\x92.14). Contextual predictors of victimization were peer status (r = \xe2\x88\x92.35, 95% CI: \xe2\x88\x92.28 to \xe2\x88\x92.41), school climate (r = \xe2\x88\x92.16, 95% CI: \xe2\x88\x92.10 to \xe2\x88\x92.21), community factors (r = \xe2\x88\x92.15, 95% CI: \xe2\x88\x92.08 to \xe2\x88\x92.22), and family/home environment (r \xe2\x88\x92 .10, 95% CI: \xe2\x88\x92.07 to \xe2\x88\x92.13). For bully/victims, contextual predictors were peer influ- ence (r = \xe2\x88\x92.44, no CI reported), peer status (r = \xe2\x88\x92.36, 95% CI: \xe2\x88\x92.23 to \xe2\x88\x92.49), school climate (r = \xe2\x88\x92.32, 95% CI: \xe2\x88\x92.26 to \xe2\x88\x92.38), and family/ home environment (r = \xe2\x88\x92.20, 95% CI: \xe2\x88\x92.11 to \xe2\x88\x92.29).\nSome meta-analyses were also conducted on specific risk or protective factors. Gini Pozzoli, and Hymel, (2014) included 15 studies finding that moral disengagement was related to perpetration of bullying (r = .25, 95% CI = .17\xe2\x80\x93.32) and cyberbullying (r = .31, 95% CI = .27\xe2\x80\x93.36) both with medium effect sizes.

For victimization, the only relationship was found with neuroticism (r = .24, 95% CI: .18\xe2\x80\x93.29).\nBased on 131 empirical studies, Kowalski et al. (2014) reported risk and protective factors for cyberbullying perpetration and victimization. These factors included traditional bullying, traditional victimization, and age, which were included in the corresponding paragraphs. Other risk factors for cyberbullying perpetration were cybervictimization (r = .51, 95% CI: .48\xe2\x80\x93.55), normative beliefs about aggression (r = .37, 95% CI: .24\xe2\x80\x93.48), moral disengagement (r = .27, 95% CI: .20\xe2\x80\x93.34), risky online behavior (r = .23, 95% CI: .20\xe2\x80\x93.26), narcissism (r = .22, 95% CI: .18\xe2\x80\x93.26), frequency of Internet use (r = .20, 95% CI: .12\xe2\x80\x93.28), and anger (r = .20, 95% CI: .17\xe2\x80\x93.22). Protective factors against cyberbullying perpetration were school safety (r = \xe2\x88\x92.13, 95% CI: \xe2\x80\x93.16 to \xe2\x80\x93.10), empa- thy (r = \xe2\x88\x92.12, 95% CI: \xe2\x80\x93.14 to \xe2\x80\x93.09), school climate (r = \xe2\x88\x92.12, 95% CI = \xe2\x88\x92.14 to \xe2\x88\x92.10), parental monitoring (r = \xe2\x88\x92.07, 95% CI: \xe2\x88\x92.13 to \xe2\x88\x92.03), and perceived support (r = \xe2\x88\x92.04, 95% CI = \xe2\x88\x92.06 to \xe2\x88\x92.02). Risk factors for cybervictimization were anger (r = .20, 95% CI: .16\xe2\x80\x93.23), risky online behavior (r = .18, 95% CI: .14\xe2\x80\x93.21), frequency of Internet use (r = .17, 95% CI: .11\xe2\x80\x93.22), moral disengagement (r = .15, 95% CI: .11\xe2\x80\x93.18), and hyperactivity (r = .11, 95% CI: .09\xe2\x80\x93.13). Protective factors against cybervictimization were school safety (r = \xe2\x88\x92.22, 95% CI: \xe2\x80\x93.24 to \xe2\x80\x93.19), school climate (r = \xe2\x88\x92.14, 95% CI: \xe2\x88\x92.14 to \xe2\x88\x92.19), social in- telligence (r = \xe2\x88\x92.08, 95% CI: \xe2\x88\x92.15 to \xe2\x88\x92.02), perceived support (r = \xe2\x88\x92 .08, 95% CI: \xe2\x88\x92.11 to \xe2\x88\x92.06), and parental monitoring (r = \xe2\x88\x92.06, 95% CI: \xe2\x88\x92.10 to \xe2\x88\x92.20).\nInvolvement in bullying and socioeconomic status was studied by Tippett and Wolke (2014) including 28 articles. Victimization was pos- itively related to low (OR = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.36\xe2\x80\x931.71) and negatively re- lated to high socioeconomic status (OR = .73, 95% CI: .63\xe2\x80\x93.86) with small effect sizes. Similar results were found for perpetration and low socioeconomic status (OR = 1.14, 95% CI: 1.02\xe2\x80\x931.27) and high socioeco- nomic status (OR = .89, 95% CI: .83\xe2\x80\x93.95). A bully\xe2\x80\x93victim status was only positively related to low socioeconomic status (OR = 1.71, 95% CI: 1.22\xe2\x80\x93 2.39). Some of these associations became much weaker when adjusted for publication bias.\nPositive and negative parenting has also been studied in relation to bullying and cyberbullying. Lereya et al. (2013) found that victimization (including bullying and cybervictimization) was related to having less parental involvement and support (g = \xe2\x88\x92.22; 95% CI: \xe2\x88\x92.29 to \xe2\x88\x92.15), less warmth and affection (g = \xe2\x88\x92.22; 95% CI: \xe2\x88\x92.30 to \xe2\x88\x92.14), less au- thoritative parents (g = \xe2\x88\x92.19, 95% CI: \xe2\x88\x92.28 to \xe2\x88\x92.11), less supervision (g = \xe2\x88\x92.16, 95% CI: \xe2\x88\x92.21 to \xe2\x88\x92.12), worse parent\xe2\x80\x93child communication (g = \xe2\x88\x92.12; 95% CI: \xe2\x88\x92.20 to \xe2\x88\x92.05), and less positive parenting in general (g = \xe2\x88\x92.19; 95% CI: \xe2\x88\x92.23 to \xe2\x88\x92.15). On the other hand, victimization was also related to more negative parenting in general (g = .26, 95% CI: .16\xe2\x80\x93.36), with more abuse and neglect (g = .31, 95% CI: .18\xe2\x80\x93.44), mal- adaptive parenting (g = .27, 95% CI: .15\xe2\x80\x93.40) and overprotection (g = .10, 95% CI: .03\xe2\x80\x93.17). A similar pattern was found in bully/victims, with less positive parenting in general (g = \xe2\x88\x92.33, 95% CI: \xe2\x88\x92.41 to \xe2\x88\x92 .26), less warmth and affection (g = \xe2\x88\x92.42, 95% CI: \xe2\x88\x92.54 to \xe2\x88\x92.31), less authoritative parents (g = \xe2\x88\x92.39, 95% CI: \xe2\x88\x92.61 to \xe2\x88\x92.18), less su- pervision (g = \xe2\x88\x92.34, 95% CI: \xe2\x88\x92.54 to \xe2\x88\x92.14), parental involvement and support (g = \xe2\x88\x92 .30, 95% CI: \xe2\x88\x92.40 to \xe2\x88\x92.20), and worse parent\xe2\x80\x93 child communication (g = \xe2\x88\x92.17, 95% CI: \xe2\x88\x92.30 to \xe2\x88\x92.04). Overall neg- ative parenting was also more common in bully/victims (g = .48, 95% CI: .26\xe2\x80\x93.70), with more abuse and neglect (g = .68, 95% CI: .44\xe2\x80\x93.92) and maladaptive parenting (g = .49, 95% CI: .23\xe2\x80\x93.75). For vic- tims, communication levels were lower when assessment was conduct- ed through peer-nomination, warmth and affection were lower for older children, and supervision was lower in Europe when compared to\nother continents. For bully/victims, involvement and support were lower when assessments were conducted through self-reports, warmth and affection were lower outside Europe and America, in older children and studies using self-reports and overall negative parenting and maladaptive parenting were observed outside Europe and America.\nSome meta-analyses were performed only on longitudinal studies with the objective of finding variables which predict bullying and vic- timization over time. Reijntjes and colleagues found in a meta-analysis including 18 studies that internalizing problems predict victimization over time (Reijntjes et al., 2011) with very small effect size (r = .08, 95% CI: .04\xe2\x80\x93.21). Studies using SEM and the same informant yielded larger effect sizes. Moreover, in another meta-analysis with 14 articles (Reijntjes et al., 2011), it was found that externalizing problems predict victimization over time, also with small effect size (r = .13, 95% CI: .04\xe2\x80\x93.21) with no moderators.\n3.4.2. Additional information from non-meta-analytic systematic reviews\nA non-meta-analytic systematic review conducted by van Noorden et al. (2015) found that, according to the majority of the 40 included studies, victimization was related to cognitive but not affective empa- thy, perpetration was negatively related to cognitive and affective em- pathy, defending the victim was positively related to both cognitive and affective empathy and mixed results were found for bystanding.\nA review of observational studies showed that, according to the ma- jority of the 31 included articles, risk factors for bullying can be found among school-related variables such as inequalities in income, poverty, lack of anti-bullying norms, deficient classroom management and teacher support and also to neighborhood-related variables such as inequalities in income and violence in the city or country. Findings on school and classroom size were inconsistent (Machado Azeredo et al., 2015).\nPerren et al. (2012) reviewed strategies for tackling cyberbullying finding that most of the studies focus on strategies themselves without evaluating their actual success. Narrative results show that parental supervision and behavior seem to be useful for prevention while confronting perpetrators, technical solutions such as blocking, seeking support from friends, and ignoring the problem are informed by youth with the objective of combating the problem or buffering its effects. Seeking support from teachers and parents was less common.\nAlthough not specifically focused on risk and protective factors, two systematic reviews reported parents\' (Harcourt et al., 2014), students\', and teachers\' (O\'Brien, 2009) understanding of bullying. Parents de- mand more information on bullying and have difficulty in recognizing the phenomenon, suggesting improvement of school response Harcourt et al. (2014)). A systematic review conducted in the UK shows that teachers define bullying in a broader way when compared to students and that definitions employed by secondary students and teachers include different components of the phenomenon such as di- rect bullying, social exclusion, repetition, power imbalance, intentional- ity, etc. O\'Brien (2009)).\n3.5. Consequences of bullying and cyberbullying\n3.5.1. Meta-analytic results\nTable 4 shows consequences of bullying and cyberbullying with small, medium, and large effect sizes.\nKowalski et al. (2014) reported the outcomes of cyberbullying perpetration (ordered by effect sizes) such as drug and alcohol use (r = .27, 95% CI: .22\xe2\x80\x93.31), anxiety (r = .16, 95% CI: .07\xe2\x80\x93.25), depression (r = .15, 95% CI: .11\xe2\x80\x93.19), life satisfaction (r = \xe2\x88\x92.11, 95% CI: \xe2\x88\x92.14 to \xe2\x88\x92.08), self-esteem (r = \xe2\x88\x92.10, 95% CI: \xe2\x88\x92.13 to \xe2\x88\x92.07), loneliness (r = .09, 95% CI: .04\xe2\x80\x93.13), and academic achievement (r = \xe2\x88\x92.09, 95% CI: \xe2\x88\x92.18 to \xe2\x88\x92.01). Cybervictimization was related to stress (r = .34, 95% CI: .29\xe2\x80\x93.38), suicidal ideation (r = .27, 95% CI = .24\xe2\x80\x93.31), depression (r = .24, 95% CI: .21\xe2\x80\x93.27), self-esteem (r = \xe2\x88\x92.17, 95%\nTable 4\nOutcomes of bullying and cyberbullying.

Relationships between cybervictimization with loneliness, and self-esteem and be- tween cyberbullying with self-esteem were larger in North American samples. Relationship between cyberbullying and depression was smaller when traditional bullying or victimization was measured in the same study. Relationship between cybervictimization and de- pression was larger for females.\nNakamoto and Schwartz (2009) included 33 studies in their analysis and found rather weak negative relationship between peer\nI.

Effect sizes were smaller for self-reports and larger for peer re- ports and multiple informants. Effects were also larger for the studies reporting school records instead of self-reported grades, studies with shared method variance and research in Asia. No differences between girls and boys were found.\nGini and Pozzoli (2013) conducted a meta-analysis with 30 studies separating the results for longitudinal and correlational research. It was found that psychosomatic problems are more common in victims of bullying in longitudinal (OR = 2.39, 95% CI: 1.76\xe2\x80\x933.24) and also cross-sectional studies (OR = 2.17, 95% CI: 1.91\xe2\x80\x932.46). In the cross- sectional studies, effect size was smaller for research with more females. A meta-analysis conducted with 20 articles focused specifically on headache Gini, Pozzoli, Lenzi et al. (2014) found a positive relationship\n16 I. Zych et al. / Aggression and Violent Behavior 23 (2015) 1\xe2\x80\x9321\nwith being bullied across longitudinal (OR = 2.10, 95% CI: 1.19\xe2\x80\x933.71) and cross-sectional studies (OR = 2.00, 95% CI: 1.70\xe2\x80\x932.35). Also, in this study, effect size was smaller for research with more females in cross-sectional design.\nSleeping problems related to victimization were analyzed by van Geel et al. (in press) including 21 articles. Results show that victims are more affected by these problems than non-victimized children (OR = 2.21; 95% CI: 2.01\xe2\x80\x932.44) with larger effect for younger children. A meta-analysis including 14 articles (van Dam et al., 2012) found that victimization was related to psychotic symptoms in general population (OR = 2.30, 95% CI: 1.5\xe2\x80\x933.4). Stronger relationship was found for in- creased duration, frequency, and severity of bullying.\nPsychosocial maladjustment was studied by Hawker and Boulton (2000) in a meta-analysis including 23 studies. Peer victimization was significantly related to depression (r = .45 with shared method vari- ance and r = .29 with no shared method variance), general self- esteem (r = .39 with shared method variance and r = .21 with no shared method variance), social-esteem (r = .35 with shared method variance and r = .23 with no shared method variance), loneliness (r = .32 with shared method variance and r = .25 with no shared method variance), and generalized and social anxiety (r = .25 with shared method variance and r = .19 with no shared method variance). Confidence intervals were not reported.\nSuicidal behavior and ideation were commonly studied variables. Holt et al. (2015) found that victimization was related to suicidal idea- tion (OR = 2.34; 95% CI: 2.03\xe2\x80\x932.69) and behavior (OR = 2.94; 95% CI: 2.36\xe2\x80\x933.67). Perpetration was also related to suicidal ideation (OR = 2.12; 95% CI: 1.67\xe2\x80\x932.69) and behavior (OR = 2.62; 95% CI: 1.51\xe2\x80\x934.55). Relationships between being a bully/victim and suicidal ideation (OR = 3.81; 95% CI: 2.13\xe2\x80\x936.80) or behavior (OR = 4.02; 95% CI: 2.39\xe2\x80\x93 6.76) were between moderate and strong. Studies conducted in the USA had larger effects for perpetration with suicidal ideation and bully/victim status with suicidal behavior. For the bully/victim status, studies with \xe2\x80\x9cdefinitional and non-behavioral\xe2\x80\x9d evaluation found larger effects. Van Geel, et al. (2014c) included 36 studies finding that victim- ization was related to suicidal ideation (adjusted OR = 2.18, 95% CI: 2.05\xe2\x80\x932.32) with stronger effect for cyberbullying than for traditional bullying and no other significant moderators. Peer victimization was also related to suicidal attempts (OR = 2.55; 95% CI: 1.95\xe2\x80\x933.34) with no significant moderators and no separate analysis for traditional vs. cyberbullying due to the low number of studies.\nRelationship between involvement in bullying and weapon carrying was studied in a meta-analysis conducted on 25 articles by van Geel, Vedder, and Tanilon (2014b). Victimization and perpetration were re- lated to weapon carrying (adjusted OR = 1.95; 95% CI: 1.60\xe2\x80\x932.36 and adjusted OR = 2.30; 95% CI: 1.90\xe2\x80\x932.77, respectively). No significant moderators were found for victimization and stronger effect size was found for perpetration in studies with higher response rate (above 75%). No differences were found between the U.S. studies and research from other countries for victims and perpetrators. Large effect sizes were found between being a bully/victim and weapon carrying (OR = 4.95; 95% CI: 3.77\xe2\x80\x936.50) larger for the studies conducted in the U.S. in comparison to other countries.\nSome meta-analyses were conducted with longitudinal studies to find long-term outcomes of bullying and victimization. Among them, Reijntjes et al. (2010) found that victimization significantly predicts in- ternalizing problems over time (r = .18, 95% CI = .12\xe2\x80\x93.24) with larger effects for studies that used SEM and the same informant. On the other hand, Reijntjes et al. (2011) found that victimization significant- ly predicts externalizing problems over time (r = .14, 95% CI: .09\xe2\x80\x93.19) with no moderator effects. Ttofi et al. (2012) performed a meta-analysis including 28 studies finding that perpetration predict- ed violence later in life (adjusted OR = 2.04; 95% CI: 1.69\xe2\x80\x932.45). The ef- fect size was negatively related to the age of perpetration assessment (younger age of perpetration was related to more violence), the age of outcome assessment (later assessments were related to less violence)\nand the length of follow-ups (longer follow-ups were related to less vi- olence). Victimization was also a predictor of later violence, although with smaller effect size (adjusted OR = 1.42; 95% CI: 1.25\xe2\x80\x931.62) and no moderators were significant. Ttofi et al. (in press) also found that perpetration predicts drug use later in life (OR = 2.22, 95% CI: 1.60\xe2\x80\x93 3.07) in a meta-analysis of 18 studies, with other factors such as child- hood individual or school risks explaining much variation (adjusted OR =1.41, 95% CI: 1.20\xe2\x80\x931.66). Victimization, on the other hand, does not predict later drug use (adjusted OR =1.02; 95% CI: .94\xe2\x80\x931.11). Ttofi et al. (2011a) also found in a meta-analysis of 28 articles that vic- timization predicts depression later in life (adjusted OR = 1.99; 95% CI: 1.71\xe2\x80\x932.32). Younger age of victimization was related to more depres- sion, later assessments and longer follow-ups were related to less de- pression. Another study, also with 28 articles (Ttofi et al., 2011b), found that perpetration predicted offending later in life (adjusted OR = 2.50; 95% CI: 2.03\xe2\x80\x933.08). Effects were stronger for perpetration in older children and weaker with long follow-ups and later outcome measures. A meta-analysis conducted on 10 prospective studies by Cunningham et al. (2015) showed that bullying was related to psychot- ic symptoms later in life (OR = 2.15, 95% CI: 1.14\xe2\x80\x934.04) with no report- ed moderators.\n3.5.2. Additional information from non-meta-analytic systematic reviews\nDifferent non-meta-analytic systematic reviews examined in- volvement in bullying or cyberbullying as perpetrators, victims, or bully/victims is related to suicidal ideation and behavior. Kim and Leventhal (2008) found that most of the studies report elevated risk of suicidal ideation and behavior in perpetrators, victims, and bully/victims. Klomek, Sourander, and Gould (2010) found that most of the cross-sectional studies report increased risk of suicidal ideation and behavior in perpetrators and victims, stronger for fe- males than males. Moreover, longitudinal studies are still scarce, but their results suggest similar pattern. Narrative results reported by Shireen et al. (2014) also suggest that involvement in bullying is related to suicide and that this relationship is stronger for females.\nAnother systematic review shows that five out of seven included studies showed that victimization is related to alcohol misuse in adoles- cents (Topper & Conrod, in press). Narrative results informed by Tokunaga (2010) suggest that cyberbullying victimization is related to low academic achievement, psychosocial and affective problems. A sys- tematic review of studies on school shooting (Sommer et al., 2014) shows that 29.9% of the shooters reported physical victimization, whereas this kind of victimization was explicitly excluded in 31.2%. More than a half (53.7%) report peer rejection (explicitly excluded in 14.9%) and about one out of eight (13.4%) report bullying perpetration.\nA systematic review conducted by Ttofi et al. (2014) on prospective longitudinal studies shows that the progression from bullying to inter- nalizing and externalizing problems can be interrupted by factors such as high school achievement, social skills, strong family attachment and structure, social support and prosocial friends.\n3.6. Effectiveness of anti-bullying programs\n3.6.1. Meta-analytic results\nMeta-analyses on effectiveness of anti-bullying programs show in- consistent findings. A study conducted by Farrington and Ttofi (2009), including 89 empirical reports, found that, overall, programs are effec- tive in reducing perpetration (OR = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.18\xe2\x80\x931.42) and victim- ization (OR =1.29, 95% CI: 1.18\xe2\x80\x931.42). For perpetration, effects were larger for older children (11 and above), outcome measures applied two or more times per month, studies published before 2003 and Nor- wegian reports. For victimization, effects were larger for outcome mea- sures applied two or more times per month, studies in Norway, outside the US/Canada, studies in Europe, randomized experiments and before- after/intervention control designs and for older children (11 or above compared between studies). Ferguson et al. (2007) meta-analyzed 45\narticles and also found that the programs produced positive results on bullying outcome (without separating victimization and perpetration) with small effect size (r = .12, 95% CI: .08\xe2\x80\x93.17). At-risk status moderated the effect with more impact for higher-risk participants and there no moderator effect of grade level (elementary, middle, or high school) and outcome measure. Lee et al. (2015) focused on victimization as a primary outcome including 13 studies also finding a small overall effect size (d = .15, 95% CI: .10\xe2\x80\x93.20) with larger effect for secondary students in comparison to elementary pupils (d = .32 vs. .14). Merrell et al. (2008) report 28 effect sizes on different variables related to bullying, among which, small effect sizes were found on self-reported positive at- titudes toward bullying (d = .15), victimization (d = .27), witnessing bullying (d = .35) and intervention to stop it (d = .17). Teacher reports showed small effects on witnessed students being bullied (d = .16), staff response (d = .30) and attitudes about school safety (d = .16) and large effects on knowledge on bullying prevention (d = 1.52) and intervention skills (d = .99). Peer reports showed small effect on partic- ipation in bullying (d = .32). No confidence intervals were reported. Polanin, Espelage, and Pigott (2012) studied the effectiveness of anti- bullying programs on bystander intervention including 12 articles. Again, the results show small positive effect on bystander intervention (g = .20, 95% CI: .11\xe2\x80\x93.29), greater in high school in comparison to pri- mary schools and greater when facilitators were other than teachers. A three-level meta-analysis using within-study analysis on 19 empirical articles (Yeager et al., in press) show that effectiveness of anti-bullying programs declines in older students with small effect in grades 1\xe2\x80\x937 (d = .13), in grades 8+ the programs were ineffective (d = .01), and there was a significant decline in grades 7th to 12th (b = \xe2\x88\x92.06, Z = 2.40, p = .016).\n3.6.2. Additional information from non-meta-analytic systematic reviews\nA non-meta-analytic systematic review reported by Baldry and Farrington (2007) found that among 16 programs, a half were effective in reducing bullying in 10% or more, 2 had mixed results, 4 had small or negligible effects (less than 10%), and 2 had iatrogenic results (an in- crease of 10% or more). Narrative results described by Cantone et al. (2015) led to conclude that most of the programs are effective in the short term but, due to the short follow-up periods, no conclusion can be drawn on the long-term effects. Evans, Fraser, and Cotter (2014) found that 50% of the included studies were effective in reducing perpetration and 67% were effective in reducing victimization. Ac- cording to the results found by Goodman et al. (2013) reviewing anti-bullying interventions in elementary and middle schools, 7 out of 8 programs reduced bullying. Smith et al. (2004), on the other hand, found that none of the 14 reviewed studies effects were large, only 7% were medium whereas 93% of the effects on victimization and 92% ef- fects on perpetration were small or trivial. Considering only the best ef- fect of each intervention, 67% showed small (the rest trivial) effects on victimization and 33% showed small (the rest trivial) effects on perpetration.\n3.7. Effectiveness of different program components\n3.7.1. Meta-analytic results\nFarrington and Ttofi (2009) compared the effectiveness of different program components. For victimization, larger effect sizes were found for programs that did not include work with peers (OR = 1.39 vs. 1.13), that used disciplinary methods (OR = 1.44 vs. 1.21), with parent training and meetings (OR = 1.41 vs. 1.20), duration for teachers of 4 days or more (OR = 1.41 vs. 1.18), with videos (OR = 1.38 vs. 1.17), cooperative group work (OR = 1.38 vs. 1.20), duration for children of 270 days or more (OR = 1.35 vs. 1.15), intensity for children of 20 h or more (OR = 1.42 vs. 1.21) and intensity for teachers of 10 h or more (OR = 1.37 vs. 1.22). For perpetration, larger effect sizes were re- ported for programs including parent training/meetings (OR = 1.57 vs. 1.25), with playground supervision (OR = 1.53 vs. 1.29), intensity for\nchildren of 20 h or more (OR = 1.62 vs. 1.25), intensity for teachers of 10 h or more (OR = 1.52 vs. 1.19), duration for children of 270 days or more (OR = 1.49 vs. 1.17), with disciplinary methods (OR = 1.59 vs. 1.31), duration for teachers of 4 or more days (OR = 1.50 vs. 1.22), with classroom management (OR = 1.44 vs. 1.15), teacher training (OR = 1.46 vs. 1.24), classroom rules (OR = 1.44 vs. 1.15), whole- school policy (OR = 1.44 vs. 1.19), school conferences (OR = 1.49 vs. 1.30), a total number of 11 or more elements (OR = 1.48 vs. 1.30), based on Olweus (OR = 1.50 vs. 1.31), with information for parents (OR = 1.44 vs. 1.21) and cooperative group work (OR = 1.48 vs. 1.31).\nFor victimization, Lee et al. (2015) found larger effect sizes for ele- ments such as emotional control training (d = .46 vs. .13), peer counsel- ing (d = .33 vs. .13), with a school policy against bullying (d = .31 vs. .12).\n3.7.2. Additional information from non-meta-analytic systematic reviews\nNarrative results of the non-meta-analytic systematic review con- ducted by Cantone et al. (2015) suggest that whole-school interven- tions are the most effective. Systematically monitored programs are more effective in comparison to those without monitoring (Smith et al., 2004). Vreeman and Carroll (2007) found that, among curriculum studies, 4 out of 10 decreased bullying, 7 out of 10 whole-school inter- ventions yielded desirable results, none of the 3 social skills trainings was effective and the programs with increased presence of social workers (1) and mentoring (1) reduced bullying.\n3.8. Evaluation strategies and methodologies: Non-meta-analytic systematic reviews\nEvans et al. (2014) reviewed studies on anti-bullying programs and found that, out of 22 evaluations of perpetration, 6 used only one item and 16 used multi-item assessment. Similarly, out of 27 evaluations of victimization, 6 used one-item and 21 multi-item assessments. Among the studies with one-item assessment 67% showed significant desirable results on perpetration and 83% on victimization whereas among the multi-item scales, 44% reported significant results on perpetration and 57% on victimization.\nRyan and Smith (2009) reviewed evaluation practices used in anti- bullying programs. This systematic review found that, in relation to pro- gram monitoring, integrity promotion (providing manuals, training, and supervising facilitators) was reported in 30 out of 31 programs (64.5% manuals, 80.1% training, and 22.6% supervision; 16.1% included all three forms) and integrity verification (verifying if the intervention was provided as intended) was not reported in 38.7% of the programs (35.5% reported adherence to manuals, 22.6% frequency and length of implementation activities, 22.6% quality of delivery, 19.3% participation and enthusiasm of the sample, 6.4% a check that only planned interven- tion was delivered). In relation to study design, it was found that 22 studies were controlled and 9 uncontrolled, with two thirds reporting no follow-up, and among the reported follow-ups, 25.8% were shorter than 6 months, 29% 6\xe2\x80\x9311 months, 25.8% 12\xe2\x80\x9323 months, and 19.3% 2 years or more. Less than 20% included qualitative components. Out of 31 studies, 30 reported evaluation of involvement in bullying (22.6% reported measures of involvement in perpetration/victimization together with other related behaviors and non-behavioral constructs, 48% reported measures of two out of three of these variables and 29% used only one). Olweus Bully/Victim Questionnaire in its modified ver- sion was used in 35.5% of the studies; 45.2% reported reliability and 54.8% some evidence of validity. One informant was included in 54.8% and two informants in 38.7%. All the studies reported some descriptive statistics but only 35.5% reported effect sizes and only 5 out of 31 mul- tilevel statistical techniques. None of the studies met all the assumption of randomized controlled trials or all the criteria for efficacy, effective- ness, or dissemination study. Another systematic review with no overall data and narrative results for each included study also concludes that\nI. Zych et al. / Aggression and Violent Behavior 23 (2015) 1\xe2\x80\x9321 17\n18 I. Zych et al. / Aggression and Violent Behavior 23 (2015) 1\xe2\x80\x9321\nthere is a great variability in research methodologies utilized in anti- bullying interventions (Chalamandaris & Piette, 2015).\nVessey et al. (2014) reviewed psychometric properties of self-report instruments used to assess bullying. These authors found that 26% of these instruments report test\xe2\x80\x93retest reliability, 90% present internal consistency (with most of the Cronbach\'s alphas above .70), and 26% with item\xe2\x80\x93total correlations. Content validity, but without describing detailed procedure, was reported in 48% of the articles. Information re- lated to floor and ceiling effects was almost completely unavailable, fac- torial validity was reported in 65% of the studies and construct validity was present in all the studies. Administration length was informed in 35% of the studies, invariance among groups in 29% and time needed for scoring was never reported.\nBerne et al. (2013) conducted a systematic review on instruments utilized for cyberbullying evaluation. The authors found that the con- cept of cyberbullying was included in 21 of the 44 instruments, and cybervictimization in 24 of the 44 instruments. Definitions of these con- cepts varied across the studies. The most commonly included devices were mobile phones (24 of the 44 instruments), and e-mail (21 of the 44). Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted for 12 of the 44 instruments and 13 had only theoretically based factors. Almost all the instruments were self-reports (41 of the 44). Internal consistency was reported for 18 out of the 44 (no other reliability was tested) and the only form of tested validity was convergent (24 out of the 44 instruments).\nVivolo-Kantor et al. (2014) systematically reviewed bullying and cyberbullying assessment strategies finding that 31.7% used the term \xe2\x80\x9cbullying\xe2\x80\x9d, 26.8% provided a definition of the phenomenon (including different components). Self-reports only were used in 75.6% of the studies, 12.2% utilized peer-nomination only, and 4.9% included both. Dichotomous response scales were present in 26.8% and scale/index in 80.5%. Timeframes for measuring the phenomena were unknown in 41.4% and 70.8% included both perpetration and victimization. Scoring strategies consisting in summed total scores were reported in 51.2% of the instruments. All the studies reported validity or reliability but with different statistics (e.g. 90.2% included Cronbach\'s alpha, 26.8% test\xe2\x80\x93 retest reliability and 2.4% split-half reliability).\nIn relation to these findings, it is worth mentioning that narrative re- sults reported by Hong and Espelage (2012) suggest that mixed method research with qualitative and quantitative methodologies could provide new insights but its use is very uncommon. Qualitative research is usu- ally naturalistic and focuses mostly on explicating the experiences of children involved in bullying from their own perspective (Patton et al., in press).\n4. Conclusions and introduction to the Special Issue\nFindings of the current systematic review show that about one out of three children are involved in some forms of bullying (Modecki et al., 2014) and at least 1 out of 5\xe2\x80\x937 children are involved in cyberbullying (Hamm et al., 2015; Modecki et al., 2014; Tokunaga, 2010). Reviewed studies also show that there is an overlap between bullying and cyberbullying, finding strong relationships between the two (Kowalski et al., 2014; Modecki et al., 2014). Analysis of sex and age differences yielded inconsistent results with trivial effect sizes for both variables (Barlett & Coyne, 2014, Cook et al., 2010, Kowalski et al., 2014) and one small effect showing more traditional bullying perpetration in boys (Cook et al., 2010). These findings do not necessarily indicate that age and sex of the students are not important. On the other hand, it seems that these relationships are complex and difficult to describe with simple analyses. Relationship with age might be curvilinear as sug- gested by Tokunaga (2010) and more meta-analyses could be helpful in finding sex differences focusing also on type (e.g. direct or indirect) or severity of bullying.\nThe current study shows that some minorities suffer from more vic- timization in comparison to the majority group (Albdour & Krouse,\n2014; Fedewa & Ahn, 2011; van Geel, Vedder, & Tanilon, 2014a), but being a member of a minority group does not necessarily lead to more victimization (Vitoroulis & Vaillancourt, 2015). Thus, specific interven- tions should be designed to prevent bullying against the vulnerable groups. It is worth mentioning that findings from a systematic review (Rose et al., 2011) suggest that this situation improves in inclusive con- texts with more diversity. Although more studies are needed, these findings should be taken into account when designing programs to pre- vent discriminatory bullying.\nIndividual and contextual risk and protective factors are related to bullying and cyberbullying. Given the fact that most of the studies are correlational, it is difficult to draw conclusions on causality of these re- lationships. Nevertheless, even without being able to establish causality, knowledge on these relationships provides valuable insights for under- standing and reducing the phenomena. Taking into account the stron- gest risk and protective factors (with medium to large effect sizes), traditional bullying perpetration is related to externalizing behavior, other related cognition, peer influence (Cook et al., 2010), and moral disengagement (Gini, Pozzoli and Hymel, 2014). Risk and protective factors for traditional victimization are internalizing problems, social competence, and peer status whereas bully/victim status is related to peer influence, externalizing behavior, social competence, self-related cognitions, academic performance, school climate, and peer status (Cook et al., 2010). Cyberbullying perpetration is related to moral disen- gagement (Gini, Pozzoli and Hymel, 2014), cybervictimization and nor- mative beliefs about aggression (Kowalski et al., 2014). No risk and protective factors with medium or large effects for cybervictimization were found and the largest effect sizes (although still small) were observed for anger, risky online behavior, and frequent Internet use (Kowalski et al., 2014).\nChildren who are involved in bullying and cyberbullying suffer from devastating consequences found in reviews of cross-sectional and also prospective longitudinal studies. Once again, no causality could be established and variables were classified as risk/protective factors or outcomes according to the original classification of each study. It is worth mentioning that variables can be risk/protective factors and out- comes at the same time as reported by Reijntjes et al. (2011, 2010)). Ac- cording to the results of two meta-analyses published by these authors, there is a vicious circle in which externalizing and internalizing prob- lems are predictors of victimization over time and, on the other hand, victimization predicts internalizing and externalizing problems over time. In relation to consequences, taking into account only variables with medium to large effect sizes, traditional bullying perpetration is re- lated to suicidal behavior (Holt et al., 2015) and offending later in life (Ttofi et al., 2011b). Traditional victimization relates to depression, lower general self- and social-esteem, loneliness, generalized and social anxiety (Holt et al., 2015) together with suicidal behavior (Holt et al., 2015, van Geel, Vedder, & Tanilon, 2014c). Bully/victim status is related to suicidal behavior and ideation (Holt et al., 2015) and weapon carry- ing (van Geel et al., 2014b). Cyberbullying perpetration is associated with drug and alcohol use and cybervictimization with stress and sui- cidal ideation (Kowalski et al., 2014).\nBullying and cyberbullying are prevalent, a lot of information has been gathered in relation to their individual and contextual risk and protective factors and the consequences are devastating for all the stu- dents involved in the phenomena. Thus, it is not surprising that dozens of anti-bullying interventions have been conducted all over the world and different meta-analyses and systematic reviews synthesized re- search on the topic.\nThe current systematic review shows that programs might be effec- tive in reducing bullying and victimization and that some programs and components work better than others. Unfortunately, the impact of these programs is small and methodologies and evaluations are frequently deficient. A previous review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses conducted by Ttofi et al. (2014) including six reports (namely Baldry & Farrington, 2007; Farrington & Ttofi, 2009; Ferguson et al., 2007;\nMerrell et al., 2008; Smith et al., 2004; Vreeman & Carroll, 2007) analyze differences and similarity among these studies. Big differences were found in numbers of searches and sources, timelines, languages, inclu- sion/exclusion criteria and their actual application, including \xe2\x80\x9cother re- lated variables\xe2\x80\x9d together with bullying and different methodological approach. Taking into account all these criteria, it seems that the meta-analyses conducted by Farrington and Ttofi (2009) would yield the most exact results. Even though the impact of the programs is limit- ed, these authors report a decrease in bullying perpetration of about 20\xe2\x80\x9323% and victimization of about 17\xe2\x80\x9320%. Taking into account the devastating consequences of bullying reported in the results of the cur- rent review, it seems crucial to conduct these interventions which, given these percentages, could stop this kind of violence for one out of five children involved in the phenomenon. Nevertheless, methodologies and evaluations of these programs should be improved and it is currently difficult to draw conclusions on overall effectiveness of these interventions (Ryan & Smith, 2009).\nAll the review studies which analyzed research methodologies re- port that they are frequently deficient with psychometric properties of the instruments that could be improved when evaluating bullying (Vessey et al., 2014) and cyberbullying (Berne et al., 2013). This issue might be crucial when evaluating the effectiveness of anti-bullying and research in the field in general.\nAlthough the current review provides an overview of the state of art in relation to bullying and cyberbullying, some limitations should be taken into account when interpreting its results. The number of the systematic reviews and meta-analyses on the topic is still scarce and, therefore, new studies would make it possible to obtain a more exact and broad analysis. A half of the articles included in this study perform systematic reviews without meta-analyses and, in case of the latter; many effect sizes are small. Thus, future reviews of review studies could also evaluate the quality of each document in relation to their re- sults and conclusions. Moreover, given the fact that causality cannot be established in most of the studies, results on risk/protective factors and consequences are only an approximation, showing correlations.\nTaking into account the findings described in a previous review on the state of art in relation to bullying and cyberbullying (Zych, Ortega- Ruiz, & Del Rey, 2015) and also the current study, further advancement in the field is needed. Given the potential of review studies to set ten- dencies in research, this Special Issue includes thirteen review articles on bullying, cyberbullying, and youth violence. These articles answer to the needs identified in the current and recent reviews.\nSince the previous review identified that researchers\' attention have been mostly focused on Northern Europe and Northern America, this Special Issue includes an article written by Sittichai and Smith (2015) on bullying in South-East Asian Countries and also another article authored by Chan and Wong (2015) focused on Chinese societies. Given that no interventions against cyberbullying were found among the most highly cited articles (Zych et al., 2015), Cross et al. (2015) de- scribe a holistic framework for the intervention in cyberbullying and an example of a program conducted within this framework. Cioppa, O\'Neil, and Craig (2015) conduct a systematic review of cyberbullying intervention programs. Taking into account that the current study showed the necessity of conducting further research on effectiveness of anti-bullying programs and their methodologies, Nocentini, Zambuto, and Menesini (2015) systematically review anti-bullying programs in virtual environment. In relation to the devastating consequences of cyberbullying also found in this study, Raskauskas and Huynh (2015) systematically review coping strategies used by victims of cyberbullying hoping to identify pathways to resilience, Baldry, Farrington, andSorrentino (2015) systematically review cyberbullying and cybervictimization risk factors using an ecological framework and A\xcc\x81lvarez-Garci\xcc\x81a, Garci\xcc\x81a, and Nu\xcc\x81n\xcc\x83ez (2015) also conduct a systematic review from an ecological perspective but applied to bullying perpetration in adolescence. Valdebenito, Ttofi, and Eisner (2015) report the results of a systematic review and a meta-analysis\nof studies on drug use among victims and perpetrators of bullying. Once again, taking into account the importance of individual and also contextual factors reported in this article, an integration of different models and factors influencing bullying and bystanding can be found in the article authored by Ettekal, Kochenderfer-Ladd, and Ladd (2015). Theoretical and empirical research on relational aggression is reviewed by Voulgaridou and Kokkinos (2015). Patchin and Hinduja (2015) contribute to knowledge on research methodology and assess- ment of cyberbullying, a crucial issue also reported in the current study. To sum up, the current Special Issue builds on the previous find- ings and set tendencies for future research on the topic.\nReferences1\n*Albdour, M., & Krouse, H.J. (2014).

Box 9086 Addis Ababa University, Addis Ababa; 2Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, AAU, Addis Ababa; 3Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, AAU, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia\nAbstract: The problem of "drug" use is an emerging and serious problem in Africa. However, studies on the use of "drug" are rare. The proposed research aimed at determining the magnitude of drug use among high school students and identify factors associated with drug use among high school students. The study was conducted in Addis Ababa, the capital city of Ethiopia, and Butajira a rural town located 150 kms south of Addis Ababa, in January 1998 using administered questionnaires. A total of 241 students, from randomly selected two government and one private secondary schools in Addis Ababa and 187 students from a government secondary school Butajira, were enrolled in the study. Alcohol and khat were the most commonly used drugs in all schools. On the other hand, cigarrete and cannabis were consumed more in the private school (48% and 31%, respectively), than in government schools (5%and 1% in Addis Ababa and 6% and 3% in Butajira, respectively) (x2 = 52, p= <0.001;x2 =39, p=< 001). Most of the students in the private school took the drugs for relaxation and entertainment while students in government schools took them mainly for social reasons. The current status of drug use and its implication are discussed. [Ethiop. J. Health Dev. 1999;13(2):101-106]\nIntroduction\nThe definition of drugs as stated in the International Convention of 1961 for Narcotic drugs, and of 1971 for psychotropic substances, includes all substances and chemicals that should not be used for any purpose other than for medical and scientific research. To date, there are 131 internationally controlled drugs which are to be used under strict medical prescription and/or for scientific research. If used for purposes otherwise, they are called illicit drugs. In the past two decades, drug use has spread widely at an unprecedented rate and has reached every part of the globe (1,2). WHO report (3) stated that illicit drug use in Africa is related with cannabis and other natural psychoactive plants. In the Americas cocaine, cannabis, heroine,\nand multiple drugs (alcohol and psychotropic drugs) are commonly utilized. In Asia, (especially Far East and Middle East (and Europe the most commonly used illicit drugs are cocaine, heroin, cannabis, amphetamines, and multiple drugs such as psychotropic drugs. The use of these drugs is rising rapidly reaching epidemic proportions in most countries.\nThe extent of illicit drug use is mainly seen among the youth. A publication of UN\xe2\x80\x99s Division of Narcotic Drugs (1) reported that "Never before have there been so many young people, even children, flirting with drugs and their associated hazards. The wide spreading drug use is depriving today\'s youngster\'s (our children) of the right to enter the coming century with dignity, good health, and the chance to make substantial contribution to the future of their countries and the world."\nThe history of drug abuse in Africa is relatively short. However, the abuse of drugs in Africa is escalating rapidly from cannabis and khat abuse to more dangerous drugs; and from limited groups of drug users to a wide range of users (4).\nNational drug studies in Nigeria showed that cannabis is predominantly used in schools and universities followed by cocaine and tobacco (4,5). In Zambia, 20 percent of university and high school students were drug users, and in Egypt, cannabis, glue and petroleum sniffing were found to be widely prevalent among students (6,7).\nStudies on substance abuse in selected urban areas in Ethiopia showed that 82 percent of street children, commercial sex workers, and street vendors as having used addictive drugs or substances. They also reported that khat, alcohol, hashish, tobacco, and solvents were the most abused substances (11). Heroine, cocaine, and other narcotic drugs were not considered to be important.\nThe Government of Ethiopia considers "drug" abuse as a serious and emerging problem. However, little attention has been given to the understanding of the factors related to drug abuse. Yet this understanding is critical to the successful implementation of the drug control strategies.\nThe recent sharp increase in khat and cannabis production and consumption may not only affect the health of individuals but also has serious socio-economic consequences. The potential adverse effect includes diversion of income for the purchase of khat and cannabis, resulting in neglect of the needs of the family. It also leads to family discord and divorce, absenteeism from work and criminal acts.\nAlthough the literature on khat is fairly extensive, and several authors strongly stated the potential adverse effects of khat, there is no well designed study that examined other illicit drug problems and factors related with their use that could serve as a tool to guide policy makers. The present study was, thus undertaken with the aim of filling this gap in knowledge on the magnitude and factors related with "drug" abuse.\nMethods\nStudy Area: The study was conducted in Addis Ababa, the capital city of Ethiopia, and Butajira, a rural town located 130 kms south of Addis. The Butajira study site was selected because it is a place where khat is produced. Addis Ababa was selected because, as a cosmopolitan city, it might be an important transiting route for international "drug trafficking".\nStudy design: School-based cross-sectional survey was used to collect data using self administered questionnaire. The schools were randomly selected. They include one urban government high school andone private high school in Addis Ababa and, one rural governmental high school from Butajira. A total of 428 students from grades 9-12 (196, 45), and students from government and private schools in Addis Ababa and Butajira government school respectively, were selected. The students were selected using a simple random sampling.\nThe study was conducted in January 1998 after responsible individuals and institutions were contacted to get permission to conduct the study. Meetings were held with school officials to familiarize them with the purpose of the study and to get their assistance. Pretesting of the data collection technique was made in Addis Ababa and nearby area high schools to evaluate the data collection tools to be used in the study. The data collection instruments were modified based on the findings of the pretest. For ethical clearance the purpose of the study was explained and informed consent was obtained from the study participants. Information provided by students and the identity of the students was kept confidential.\nData analysis and presentation: Frequencies tables are used for data presentation and x2 tests are used for comparing different groups.\nResults\nOf the total 428 students, aggregated across all schools in the study, 241 (56%) were from the Addis Ababa secondary schools and 187 (46%) were from Butajira secondary school. Nearly 80% were in the age range of 15-19 and about two thirds of them were males. Two hundred fifty nine (60.5%) were Orthodox Christians and 163 (38%) were Amhara by ethnicity. Oromo and Tigray students account 12.1% and 8.4%, respectively. Moslems account for 21% of the students. The socio- demographic characteristics of the students aggregated across all schools are depicted in Table 1.\nAlcohol and Khat were the two "drugs" commonly ever tried by high school students both in government and private schools. The percentages of ever use of alcohol were 17.9%, 57.8%, and 18.2% in urban governmental high school, private high school, and Butajira rural governmental high school, respectively. Similarly khat use is 9.2%,35.6%and 31%, respectively. Only a very small percentage (1.7%- and 2.7% students of urban and rural governmental high schools, respectively) ever used cannabis and, similarly, cigarette was ever used by 5.1% and 6.4%, respectively. In contrast to results obtained from government secondary school students, (31.1%) a significant proportion of privately owned secondary school students (48.9%) have admitted ever using cannabis and cigarrete. The frequency distribution of ever used "drugs" by students from the different high schools is displayed in Table 2.\n"Drugs" abuse was significantly more among students of the private high school compared to that of government school students. However, none of the students reported the use of hard drugs, such as cocaine or heroine, in any of the schools. Out of the 36 respondents of urban governmental high school students who ever tried "drug", 23(64%) admitted that the first "drug" they took was alcohol; 10\n(27.7%) reported khat, and three (8.3%) cigarrete. Most of the students (67.5%) started using "drugs" between the ages of 12 to 16 years. Sixteen (72.6%) of the 26 students in Private High School who tried drug said that alcohol was the first "drug" that they tasted while eight (30.7%) tasted cigarette, and two (7.7%) reported khat, and the ages at which the students started using "drugs" ranged between six and 22 years.\nFifty eight (75.5%) of the 77 students from Rural Governmental High School reported to have tasted khat; first 15(19.5%) took alcohol first while remaining four (5.2%) took cigarette for the first time. The age at which Butajira students started using "drug" ranged between eight and 19 years. The distribution of ever tried "drugs" by first "drug" used and age of starting "drugs) is summarized in Table 4.\nTable 4 indicated that alcohol is the "first drug" ever tried by students in Addis\nAbaba compared to Butajira where khat is the initial "drug" predominantly used (X2=33.59; p<.001 and x2 =45.47; P<.001 for alcohol and khat, respectively).\nA large proportion of students, 17(65%) in the private school used "drugs" for relaxation and entertainment while, only four (11%) and\n12(15.6%) of students of Urban Governmental and Rural governmental High Schools, respectively, use "drugs" for relaxation and entertainment. Social reasons were the main motives for commencement of use of "drugs" in public schools(30.5% and 26%) for Urban and Rural Governmental High Schools, respectively) in contrast to private school where social reason accounted for only 13%. The reasons for taking "drug" as reported by students is summarized in Table 5.\nDiscussion\nThe overall rate of "ever used drug" for, at least, one "drug" is 32.5%, with about 41% in rural governmental, 57.8% in Private, and 18.4% in Urban governmental High Schools. The most commonly used "drugs" are alcohol, khat and cigarrete in all schools with cannabis and cigarrete being more prominent in the private school than in the public schools. Alcohol was the first drug to be used by students in Addis while khat the first drug that was used in Butajira. Unlike our findings, national drug studies in Nigeria showed that cannabis is predominantly used in schools and universities followed by cocaine and tobacco (4,5). But in this study khat is predominantly used by students in all schools perhaps because khat is widely cultivated in many party of Ethiopia and, furthermore, in some places, it is culturally and socially acceptable to chew khat.\nThe use of cannabis and cigarrete seems more in Addis Ababa and in the private school. Hard drugs like heroine, cocaine, and amphetamine are not reported to be used by students though these drugs are commonly used in other parts of the continent (3).\nHowever, the use of "drugs" in Africa is shifting rapidly from cannabis and khat to the more dangerous "drugs" and from limited groups of "drug" users to a wide range of users (4) and there is a possibility that such shift may also be seen in Ethiopia.\nThe few studies done in Ethiopia regarding the use of khat, alcohol, and cigarrete had indicated that the use of these "drugs" is high and is most commonly found among youngsters, street children, commercial sex workers, and students(8). The adverse effect is diversion of income for the purchase of drugs at the expense of the needs of the family, leading to family discord and divorce, absenteeism from work, and criminal acts.\nA large proportion of students, (65%) in the private school used "drugs" for relaxation and entertainment in contrast to students of Urban governmental and Rural governmental Schools. On the other hand, social reasons were the main causes for the commencement of use of "drugs" in public schools (30.5% and 26% for urban and rural areas, respectively) as compared to the private school. This could be due to better financial access for those who are in the private school.\nDrug use is mainly by the youngest age group (15-19 years) and this is similar to findings of Zein (9) where one third of Gondar college students of ages 16-23 years were khat users. Similarly, Adugna et al (10) noted that, among Agaro secondary school students of southwestern Ethiopia, the prevalence of khat use was 64.9% in the age group between 15 to 22 years. The frequent use of "drugs" by youngsters documented in this study and elsewhere could be due to the curiosity of the youngsters to explore new "experiences" and their vulnerability to them.\nIt is obvious that drug use has negative consequences on the economic development of a country as the health, time and money of the most productive section of human resource (youngsters) are affected by the habit of indulging in drugs. It is high time for policy makers to revise the rules and regulations regarding the control of the use of illicit drugs. Khat, which Ethiopia does consider to be an illicit drug, is a cash crop and an important source of foreign exchange next to coffee and skin and hides (11). Besides, in some areas like Harrar, production and chewing of khat is deeply rooted culturally that controlling khat chewing and production will create a socio-economic imbalance. On the other hand, khat chewing in some areas occurs together with the use of other substances such as alcohol, cigarrete, cannabis, etc. Since khat, as a cash crop, involves farmers, traders, bankers, and society in general, any policy to control khat should take the resulting economic disturbance into consideration. Therefore, it is the view of the authors that if a policy is not formulated that regulates the use of illicit drugs, including khat, the use of hard drugs among youngster is inevitable in the near future. This study has tried to highlight the type, extent, and age group at which illicit drug is being used in Ethiopia. The authors believe that the study will stimulate more research in this area as well as help policy makers in making decisions.\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to acknowledge the UNDP for sponsoring this study.

Haas, Jennifer M. Barthel, and Stephanie Taylor\nPacific Graduate School of Psychology, Palo Alto University\nResearch has demonstrated a link between alcohol use and multiple forms of risky sexual behavior, particularly among college-age individuals. Studies have also linked heavy alcohol use to other problems, such as impaired consciousness resulting from an alcohol-induced blackout, which may impact sexual decision making. However, research has rarely examined sexual risk taking (SRT) in relation to blackouts, nor has it examined this construct during the precollege transition (i.e., the interval of time between high school graduation and college matriculation). This study examined the intersection between alcohol-involved SRT, blackouts, and gender in a sample of precollege individuals with prior alcohol use (N = 229; 54% male, 63% White). Results indicated that, despite drinking less per occasion, women reporting recent blackouts were at increased risk for experiencing unwanted, unsafe, and regretted sexual behaviors compared to men with recent blackouts and their peers with no recent blackouts. Women with recent blackouts also reported differences in alcohol expectancies that may increase their risk for experiencing negative consequences while drinking, including higher social expectancies and lower negative expectancies of danger. Future directions for research and implications for precollege interventions are discussed.\n Alcohol use is highly prevalent in adolescents and a proximal risk factor for engagement in risky sexual beha- vior (Cooper, 2006; Desiderato & Crawford, 1995; Grello, Welsh, & Harper, 2006; Halpern-Felsher, Millstein, & Ellen, 1996; Mair, Ponicki, & Gruenewald, 2016). Sexual risk taking (SRT) while drinking is preva- lent in adolescents and emerging adults and includes a wide range of behaviors, ranging from indiscriminate activities (e.g., multiple sex partners, unplanned sexual activity) to ones where an individual neglects protective actions against pregnancy and sexually transmitted dis- eases (STDs) (e.g., not using a condom) (Cooper, 2002). Though risky sexual acts occur in both intoxicated and sober individuals, drinking potentiates the risk for enga- ging in sexual behaviors with negative repercussions by a variety of means. These include lowering inhibitions\nThis research was supported in part by internal funds from Santa Clara University Office of Student Life.

In addition, drinking can impair decision making and encoding of memories around a drinking event, as is the case with alcohol-related blackouts (ARBs).\nMuch of the research on SRT while intoxicated and blackouts has occurred in silos, emphasizing either black- outs or SRT. Studies that have examined these constructs together have shown a link between alcohol-related black- outs and several risky sexual activities (Martinez, Sher, & Wood, 2014; Orchowski, Mastroleo, & Borsari, 2012). Despite this link, there is scant research examining the extent to which alcohol-related SRT varies vis-a\xcc\x80-vis differ- ences in both gender and recent blackout incidence. Similarly, much of the extant research has focused on individuals already in college and has not examined SRT and blackouts during the transition between high school graduation and college entry. The purpose of this study was to expand the current research on blackouts and SRT by examining gender differences in three risky sexual activities during the interval between high school gradua- tion and college entry (i.e., \xe2\x80\x9cprecollege\xe2\x80\x9d). In the following sections, we briefly review the literature on both alcohol- related SRT and blackouts in precollege and college\n \nsamples, as well as the role of alcohol expectancies and significance of examining this issue prior to college matriculation.\nSexual Risk Taking and Alcohol Use\nBy the time adolescents are high school seniors, over two- thirds have had sexual intercourse, with one in three reporting recent activity (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2014). Many adolescents, including college freshmen, engage in sexual behaviors while under the influence of alcohol, placing them at increased risk for negative conse- quences from sexual encounters (Mair et al., 2016). Alcohol- related SRT refers to a variety of behaviors that increase the likelihood of experiencing a negative consequence associated with sexual contact, including unsafe, unplanned, or regretted sexual acts. These behaviors can lead to many negative out- comes, including STDs, unwanted/unplanned pregnancy, and increased risk for sexual victimization (Abbey, Ross, McDuffie, & McAuslan, 1996; Leigh & Stall, 1993).\nThe prevalence of SRT while drinking is particularly high among matriculated college students, who may have greater independence and sexual opportunities than their high school peers (Barnett et al., 2014). In fact, one study found that rates of alcohol-related SRT increased by over 5% from high school to college (Orchowski & Barnett, 2012). However, women may be at disproportionate risk for experiencing these adverse effects. For example, using two SRT behaviors (unplanned and unsafe sex), Mair and colleagues (2016) noted that, among alcohol users, women reported a higher prevalence relative to college men. Other studies examining alcohol-related regretted sex have shown comparable patterns (Barnett et al., 2014; Orchowski et al., 2012). In one study, 32% of college students reported alco- hol-related regretted sex, with women showing 67% greater odds than their male counterparts (Barnett et al., 2014). Correspondingly, event-level research has shown that women with higher blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) experience greater negative sexual consequences than their peers with lower levels (Scaglione et al., 2014).\nAlcohol-Related Blackouts\nAnother consequence associated with higher BAC levels is the occurrence of blackouts (Ryback, 1970). Blackouts are characterized by amnesia during the intoxication episode in which individuals are able to engage in salient, emotional events of which they have no memory later (White, Jamieson-Drake, & Swartzwelder, 2002) and which occur from a rapid rise in BAC typically brought on by drinking too quickly or ingesting excess quantities of alcohol (Lee, Roh, & Kim, 2009). Amnesia results from a disruption in long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus which pro- duces impairment in encoding of new information while under the influence (Schummers & Browning, 2001; White,\n2003). Blackouts can occur for an entire drinking event (en bloc) or for partial events (fragmentary blackouts or \xe2\x80\x9cgray- outs\xe2\x80\x9d) (Perry et al., 2006; Rose & Grant, 2010). Fragmentary blackouts are more commonly reported, and persons can activate some retrieval with effective cueing. Conversely, en bloc blackouts produce complete amnesia resulting in perma- nent, irretrievable memory loss (Lee et al., 2009).\nBlackouts are one of the most common consequences reported by adolescents and college student drinkers (Barnett et al., 2014; Hingson, Zha, Simons-Morton, & White, 2016). A recent study reported that 66% of college students reported at least one blackout in the past three years (Marino & Fromme, 2015) and another study found recent (i.e., past two weeks) blackout incidence to be 12% among precollege individuals (White & Swartzwelder, 2009). Multiple factors contribute to blackout risk, including drink- ing hard alcohol (White, 2003) and engaging in drinking styles that promote rapid ingestion (e.g., pregaming; LaBrie, Hummer, Kenney, Lac, & Pedersen, 2011). There is also evidence supporting a biological propensity for blackouts, either through genetic susceptibility (Hartzler & Fromme, 2003b; White, 2003) or as a sequela of damage resulting from prior heavy drinking (Wetherill & Fromme, 2011).\nAnother risk factor is biological sex. Women are physically smaller than men and have differences in alcohol metabolism that lead to higher BACs even with amounts of alcohol scaled according to body weight (Rose & Grant, 2010). Though men and women report comparable rates of blackout incidence, these aforementioned differences in pharmacokinetics place females at an increased risk for blackouts despite lower levels of alcohol involvement (Barnett et al., 2014).\nBlackouts and Alcohol-Related Sexual Risk Taking\nBlackouts are a significant consequence by themselves, yet few have directly examined blackout incidence in relation to other risky sexual acts that may place an indi- vidual at increased risk for negative consequences (e.g., health concerns from unprotected sex). Available studies highlight the scope of the problem but have focused pre- dominantly on epidemiological studies or aggregated SRT behaviors into a single construct of sexual consequences. For example, a large-scale, multisite epidemiological study estimated that as many as 110,000 college students reported being too intoxicated to say whether they had consented to sex (Hingson, Zha, & Weitzman, 2009). Another study examining blackouts and sexual conse- quences found that approximately 25% of both male and female students who had blacked out engaged in some form of sexual activity (White et al., 2002) but did not further distinguish that activity into specific risky sexual acts. Other studies have shown the link between incapaci- tation due to high BACs and unwanted sexual activity (Kilpatrick, Resnick, Ruggiero, Conoscenti, & McCauley, 2007; Testa, Livingston, Vanzile-Tamsen, & Frone, 2003) as well as risky sexual practices (e.g., hooking up; Flack\n2\nHAAS, BARTHEL, AND TAYLOR\net al., 2007). However, these studies did not examine blackouts in relation to discrete SRT behaviors. As such, there is a clear need to explore the link between recent alcohol-related blackout activity, gender, and SRT while under the influence.\nAlcohol Expectancies and Sexual Risk Taking\nAnother risk factor of both SRT and blackouts are expectancies that promote sexual facilitation and/or hea- vier consumption. Alcohol expectancies refer to the antici- pated outcomes (cognitive, affective, and behavioral) that an individual has about the effects of alcohol use (Goldman, Brown, Christiansen, & Smith, 1991). Prior studies have found an association between positive expec- tancies (e.g., social, global positive) with blackouts (Hartzler & Fromme, 2003a) as well as SRT (Leigh, 1990). As such, there are proximal risk factors that influ- ence perceptions about the role alcohol plays in the facil- itation of and/or enhancement of sexual experiences. For example, studies have found a link between sexual expec- tancies and drinking before sexual encounters (White, Fleming, Catalano, & Bailey, 2009), number of sexual partners (Hendershot, Stoner, George, & Norris, 2007), beliefs related to unsafe sex outcomes (Abbey, Saenz, & Buck, 2005), and sexual victimization (Corbin, Bernat, Calhoun, McNair, & Seals, 2001). Dose-dependent effects were reported by Stappenbeck et al. (2013) who reported sexual enhancement expectancies were highest among moderate and heavy episodic (i.e., binge) drinkers, with heavy episodic drinkers, in turn, engaging in greater SRT relative to other classes of alcohol users. Some studies have suggested that SRT was mediated by disinhibition resulting from higher levels of global positive expectancies (Fromme, Katz, & D\xe2\x80\x99Amico, 1997) as well as alcohol consumption consistent with intoxication (BAC of .08 or greater; Fromme, D\xe2\x80\x99Amico, & Katz, 1999). However, others have posited that expectancies are the mediator between use and SRT, with individuals who report higher levels of sexual facilitation expectancies engaging in greater SRT (Carey, Durney, Shepardson, & Carey, 2015; Fromme et al., 1999). Based on both conceptualizations, there does appear to be a link between anticipated positive effects from alcohol use and risky sexual behaviors, parti- cularly expectancies of sexual enhancement or facilitation.\nImportance of Examining Sexual Risk Taking and Blackouts in Precollege Students\nThe majority of research on alcohol-related SRT and blackouts has been conducted on young adults who have already matriculated into college. However, there is growing evidence that risky behaviors are increasing prior to college entry, during the transition from high school to higher education. For example, increases during the precollege\ntime frame have been noted for both risky sexual activities (Fromme, Corbin, & Kruse, 2008; Olmstead, Roberson, Pasley, & Fincham, 2015) and alcohol consumption (Haas, Smith, Kagan, & Jacob, 2012; Hartzler & Fromme, 2003c; Read, Wardell, & Bachrach, 2013; Sher & Rutledge, 2007). Given the pro-drinking culture present on U.S. college campuses today, coupled with lower levels of parental mon- itoring, individuals who are having problems precollege may be at a heightened risk for more severe problems and negative consequences as first-year students relative to their peers with lower propensities for drinking.\nThe Current Study\nThe current study was designed to further the literature combining SRT and problematic alcohol consumption. As shown in the aforementioned review, heavy drinking has been linked to both SRT and blackouts; however, few studies have examined how these constructs together con- tribute to different risk for SRT while drinking, either by group (blackout versus not) or further stratified by gender. Likewise, though there is a growing body of research examining multiple forms of SRT in college samples, rela- tively few studies have examined this issue in college- bound students who have not yet made the transition to college living. Given the increased attention being paid to sexual victimization on campuses today, information regarding precollege SRT would be valuable for better understanding the kinds of SRT behaviors new students are already practicing, as well as for helping campus health professionals develop effective prevention and intervention programming.\nPrimary goals for this study were to identify alcohol- related blackout incidence as a significant correlate of SRT while intoxicated and provide descriptive information regarding differences in alcohol consumption, problems, and expectancies by gender. New college students with recent alcohol use were stratified into four groups, with gender (male/female) crossed with past three-month black- out incidence [occurred (ARB+) versus did not (ARB\xe2\x88\x92)]. Consumption and SRT behaviors were assessed for the three months preceding college entry. Based on the extant literature we hypothesized the following:\nH1: We anticipated greater alcohol consumption (quantity and drinking days per month) among individuals with recent blackouts, with women ARB+ consuming less than their male ARB+ peers. Furthermore, we hypothesized that ARB + status would be associated with risker drinking overall as measured by binge drinking and pregaming.\nH2: There would be corresponding differences in alcohol expectancies, such that ARB+ individuals would report greater social and sexual expectancies, and reduced negative expectancies of danger, compared to ARB\xe2\x88\x92 individuals even when controlling for overall consumption. Within the\nSEX AND DRUGS AND STARTING SCHOOL\n3\nARB+ groups, women would have stronger expectancies of social and sexual facilitation, and lower negative expectan- cies of danger compared to men.\nH3: Alcohol-related blackouts would have a unique contri- bution to SRT above and beyond consumption, with higher rates of SRT reported by ARB+ women.\nMethod Procedure and Participants\nEntering college freshmen from a West Coast, private uni- versity were recruited into the study during a university-spon- sored welcome event immediately preceding the first day of classes in September 2011. Three of the seven campus resi- dential learning communities were selected at random to pro- vide a representative sample, and affiliated students were escorted to the recruitment session by residence hall staff. Individuals were informed of the inclusion criteria (i.e., age 18 or older and willing to provide written consent), notified of purpose and duration of the study, and invited to participate. Interested, eligible students then completed written informed consent followed by a 15-minute paper-and-pencil assessment. Trained research assistants were available to answer questions and review the questionnaires for completeness. A $5 gift card was provided upon completion as incentive. All study proce- dures received institutional review board (IRB) approval at the performance site and lead investigator\xe2\x80\x99s institution prior to data collection.\nQuestionnaires were completed by over 85% of students attending the recruitment session (N = 315). However, because the study examined variations in alcohol-related conse- quences, the final sample was restricted to individuals report- ing alcohol use in the past three months (n = 229; 72.7% of all participants). Participants were of traditional college age (M = 18.16 years) and relatively diverse (54.2% men; 62.9% White, 12.6% Asian/Pacific Islander, 15.7% Latino/a, 2.6% Black, and 6.2% other/not disclosed). Comparison with uni- versity demographics and prior studies conducted at this site (Haas, Smith, Kagan, & Jacob, 2012; Haas, Kagan, & Smith, 2013; Haas, Wickham, & Gibbs, 2016) indicated that the sample was representative of the overall university census with regard to gender and ethnic composition.\nMeasures\nDemographics. Participants self-reported age, sex, ethnicity, current living arrangements, intention to rush a fraternity or sorority, and age of first alcohol use.\nCurrent Alcohol Use. Participants were presented with a chart depicting standard drink equivalents (i.e., 1.5 ounces of hard alcohol, 5 ounces of wine, or 12 ounces beer) and asked to report drinking behaviors in the summer between high school\ngraduation and college matriculation. Items assessed typical quantity (\xe2\x80\x9cHow many total drinks do you usually consume per occasion when you drink [over the course of the entire night, day, or occasion that you are drinking]?\xe2\x80\x9d; continuously scaled) and frequency [\xe2\x80\x9cDuring this past summer how often did you drink alcohol?\xe2\x80\x9d; 13-point Likert ranging from 0 = Never to 12 = Daily]. The frequency item lent itself to transposition into days drinking, which was used in the study analyses. Separate, comparable items assessed past 30-day use to generate a Quantity-Frequency Index score (QFI; Cahalan, Cisin, & Crossley, 1969), with higher scores indicative of greater overall alcohol involvement. Binge-drinker status was operationalized using the 5/4 criteria (i.e., 5 or more drinks for men/4 or more drinks for women on one occasion in the past two weeks; Wechsler, Dowdall, Davenport, & Rimm, 1995). Pregaming and drinking game participation were measured using a single item asking participants to report the percentage of overall drinking events involving the practice, which was dichotomized (no pregaming, pregaming) for use in the analyses.\nRutgers Alcohol Problem Index (Sample \xce\xb1 = .88). Past-year incidence of alcohol problems was assessed using the Rutgers Alcohol Problem Index (RAPI; White & Labouvie, 2000), an 18-item self-report measure with responses scored from 0 = Never to 3 = Happened more than five times. Two of the items on the scale assessed symptoms consistent with blackouts or impaired consciousness (e.g., \xe2\x80\x9cSuddenly found yourself in a place that you could not remember getting to\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9cpassed out or fainted suddenly\xe2\x80\x9d). To avoid criterion contamination, these items were removed and a modified RAPI (blackout items omitted, 16 items total) was used for the study analyses.\nAlcohol-Related Risky Sexual Behaviors and Blackout Items. Four separate items assessed past three-month incidence of alcohol-related SRT and blackouts using a using a 4-point scale ranging from 0 = Never to 3 = Happened frequently. Participants self-reported engaging in \xe2\x80\x9cunplanned sexual activity while drinking,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cunsafe sex while drinking or drunk,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9chad a sexual encounter while drinking that you later regretted\xe2\x80\x9d (sample \xce\xb1 = .72). A separate item assessed ARB using the stem \xe2\x80\x9cforgot where you are or what you did (blackouts).\xe2\x80\x9d These items were part of a larger, investigator-generated scale assessing alcohol-related problems common among college students and have been used in prior studies (Haas et al., 2012; Haas et al., 2013; Haas et al., 2016).\nAlcohol Expectancy Inventory. Expectancies were measured using subscales of the Alcohol Expectancy Inventory (AEI; Darkes & Goldman, 1997) The AEI is a 24- item measure containing 24 expectancy words assessing positive and negative expectancies in multidimensional space (arousing-sedating crossed with positive-negative vectors). Participants respond to each word using the stem \xe2\x80\x9cDrinking alcohol makes one _________\xe2\x80\x9d on a 7-point scale ranging from\n4\nHAAS, BARTHEL, AND TAYLOR\nNever to Always. This study utilized two three-word subscales representing positive expectancies [sexual facilitation (\xe2\x80\x9chorny\xe2\x80\x9d; sample \xce\xb1 = .75) and social (\xce\xb1 = .85)] and one arousing, negative expectancy (\xe2\x80\x9cdangerousness,\xe2\x80\x9d \xce\xb1 = .80).\nData Analyses\nPreliminary analyses were conducted to evaluate item frequencies and distributions. One variable (QFI) was not normally distributed (skew = 2.40; kurtosis = 5.70) and was square-root transformed for use in the regression analyses per the recommendations specified by Tabachnick and Fidell (2013). Less than 10% of participants reported multiple inci- dences of individual SRT behaviors, and these variables were dummy-coded [occurred (+) or did not occur (\xe2\x88\x92)] for use in subsequent analyses. Similarly, multiple incidents of ARB were infrequent (7.8% of sample; n = 20), and a grouping variable was created by dichotomizing responses (0 = ARB\xe2\x88\x92; 1\xe2\x80\x933 collapsed to single category of ARB+). Evaluation of group differences in drinking characteristics and alcohol expectancies was conducted using a series of 2 \xc3\x97 2 (gender \xc3\x97 ARB status) analyses of variance (ANOVAs) or analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs). Other analyses (i.e., chi-square and logistic regressions) were done by stratifying participants into four groups based on gender and ARB status: male ARB\xe2\x88\x92 (n = 80), female ARB\xe2\x88\x92 (n = 74), male ARB+ (n = 44), and female ARB+ (n = 31). Analyses to address the study hypoth- eses are described in further detail in the next section.\nResults Sample Characteristics\nAlcohol use characteristics for the entire sample are summar- ized in Table 1. On average, participants reported 4.9 drinks per occasion, with 54% having at least one binge episode in the past two weeks. The modal participant reported less than monthly consumption; however, 15% were drinking on three or more days per week. Pregaming and drinking game participation, two drinking styles associated with rapid consumption and hard alcohol use, were highly prevalent (64% and 78%, respectively). Blackouts were the most prevalent alcohol-related consequence measured in the current study (35%), followed by risky sexual behaviors of unplanned (31%), regretted (17.5), and unsafe sex (12.7). Overall, 34.9% (n = 80) of participants reported at least one risky sexual behavior; a minority (7%, n = 16) endorsed all three.\nHypothesis 1: Comparing Overall Alcohol Involvement by Gender and Blackout Status\nDifferences in alcohol consumption and problems were examined using a series of 2 \xc3\x97 2 ANOVAs that evaluated group differences in overall alcohol use and problems.

Comparable results were found for ARB, with participants reporting recent black- outs consuming more and having additional problems. Gender-by-ARB interaction effects were found for all con- sumption indices. Male ARB+ students drank nearly twice as often as their female ARB+ peers and consumed more drinks per occasion. Though not statistically significant, male ARB+ students and reported more alcohol-related consequences as measured by the RAPI (p = .10). No differences were found (main effects or interaction) for age of first use.\nTwo chi-square analyses were conducted to examine differences in point prevalence of recent binge drinking and pregaming activities. As shown in Figure 1, results indicated differences in risky drinking practices but were constrained to differences by blackout incidence with both binge drinking and pregaming rates two- to threefold higher for students with recent blackouts, \xcf\x872 (3, N = 226) = 65.92 and 61.81, respectively, ps < .001.\nHypothesis 2: Differences in Alcohol Expectancies\nGroup means for the expectancy domains are presented in the lower portion of Table 2. Three 2 \xc3\x97 2 ANCOVAs were used to evaluate differences in expectancies while controlling for overall consumption using QFI. Results indicated that women had greater expectancies of dangerousness than men, and ARB positive status was related to greater social expectancies. No interaction effects were observed.\n5\n100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0\n95.5\n96.8\nHAAS, BARTHEL, AND TAYLOR\nTable 2.

Separate models were conducted for each sex- ual behavior (i.e., regretted, unsafe, and unplanned), with men reporting no blackouts (male ARB\xe2\x88\x92) used as the refer- ence group for comparison. Overall alcohol involvement (QFI, square root corrected) was entered in Step 1 to control for consumption differences between the gender-by-ARB categories. Interitem correlations are presented in Table 3. Regression results are summarized in Table 4.\nAll three models were statistically significant and cor- rectly classified 77% or more of all cases. A similar pattern emerged across the analyses. When entered alone, overall alcohol use was a significant predictor of each risky sexual behavior in Step 1 (all ps < .001). However, a consistent pattern of group differences emerged, even when overall use was statistically controlled. Men and women who reported no blackouts had relatively equal risk for engaging in regretted, unsafe, or unplanned sex (OR = 0.88, 1.60, and 1.17, respectively). Men with recent blackouts (ARB+) reported slightly higher but nonsignificant risk relative to their male peers with no recent blackouts (ARB\xe2\x88\x92) (all OR < 1.55). However, women with recent blackout activity showed a different pattern. Relative to male ARB\xe2\x88\x92\n6\nTable 3. Bivariate Correlations of Variables in Logistic Regressions\nVariable\nVariable 123456\nof entering college students. Overall, findings validated prior studies indicating that women were at greater risk for SRT, but provided additional information about the incre- mental increase in risk women have when they engage in drinking sufficient to produce blackouts. Compared to men with no recent blackouts, women with recent blackouts were three to five times more likely to engage in SRT while drinking on all indices (unsafe, unplanned, and regretted), whereas men with a history of blackouts, and women with no blackouts, were only moderately at risk (all OR < 1.75). However, this risk taking for women with recent blackouts occurred in the context of lower levels of alcohol use and greater expectancies of dangerousness from alcohol. Consistent with prior studies (White et al., 2002), women with recent blackouts reported significantly less overall alcohol involvement and fewer aggregate alcohol-related problems than men reporting blackouts. Similarly, within the blackout conditions, no differences were found for risky drinking styles like binge consumption, pregaming, or drinking-game participation. Overall, results provide compelling evidence that blackout incidence increases the risk for SRT in women who drink.\nOne reason for investigating alcohol-related blackouts and gender in relation to SRT is the increasing concern over college student sexual health issues. Adolescents and college students represent nearly one-fourth of the new cases of STDs each year in the United States (Scholly, Katz, Gascoigne, & Holck, 2005).

Male ARB\xe2\x88\x92 group used as reference group for ARB by gender\n7\nindicated that nearly 40% of the sample had engaged in unsafe or unplanned sexual activity in the past three months while drinking. These risky sexual behaviors increase the likelihood of an individual failing to use protection (e.g. condom use), which contributes to negative consequences such as unplanned pregnancy and STDs. An increase in number of sexual partners from unplanned sexual activity and unsafe practices are both known to increase the prob- ability of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) exposure (Fromme et al., 1999). Unwanted or unplanned pregnancies are potentially life-changing consequences that can impact a student\xe2\x80\x99s academic success. As such, women are dispropor- tionally experiencing negative burdens due to unplanned pregnancies.\nIn addition to the sexual health concerns, understanding alcohol-related blackouts and SRT in this population is of importance due to the challenges associated with being young adults. Often referred to as transitional youth, as they have left adolescence but have yet to grasp the responsibilities of adulthood (Arnett, 2000; Hicks & Heastie, 2008), the uncertainty and instability in the lives of young adults makes this population a concern of its own (Arnett, 2007). Issues of concern for these transitional youth include renegotiating family relationships and sup- port, forming new peer relationships, (Hicks & Heastie, 2008), coping with loss of high school friends (Cleary, Walter, & Jackson, 2011), psychological health issues, identity exploration, exploration of romantic relationships, and increases in experimentation (Arnett, 2000). Several types of risky behaviors peak during ages 18 to 25, includ- ing unprotected sex, substance use, and risky driving beha- viors (Arnett, 2000). These risky behaviors can be understood through an identity exploration lens as young people desire to have diverse experiences before obtaining the responsibilities and commitments that come with an adult life. The transition out of their childhood home is the first opportunity many of these young adults have to indi- viduate and explore their newfound freedoms (Hicks & Heastie, 2008), giving rise to a concern for possible increased risky behaviors. Increased autonomy and a lack of monitoring by parents allow young adults to pursue their desire for new experiences (i.e., risky behaviors) more freely. Research has shown that during the transition from high school to college there are increases in both number of sexual partners and alcohol use (Fromme et al., 2008). Decreased supervision, increased freedom, and increased availability for both sexual partners and alcohol use were found to be factors contributing to the risky behaviors for young adults (Fromme et al., 2008).\nLimitations and Future Directions\nAlthough the findings of this study add to the existing literature on blackouts and SRT in college students, it is not without limitations. The current sample utilized data from a relatively understudied, high-risk group of students (i.e., entering freshmen), examined SRT during an important\ndevelopmental transition (precollege), and found modest group differences on alcohol consumption, expectancies, and problem indices, including specific SRT behaviors. Though representative of the larger student body at our study site, the sample was collected at a single site at a private university, which limits the generalizability of the results. In particular, this site has a high percentage of freshmen who would be residing on campus, and it is unclear if the same predictors would emerge if this study was conducted at a location with more commuter students who planned to reside at home. In a similar vein, we did not assess parental or participant socioeconomic status (SES) in this study, and we acknowledge that a private university in the San Francisco area may draw students who are better off financially relative to other institutions. Both of these factors could influence access to alcohol and/or social norms regarding use and sexual activity, precollege as well as upon matriculation. Future research would benefit from a multisite, multicohort, multiyear design to address cohort effect, determine behavioral changes over time, and increase generalizability across colleges in the United States.\nAnother potential limitation was the cross-sectional nat- ure of the data collected and the manner with which black- outs, SRT behaviors, and alcohol use were measured. This study asked separate items that evaluated alcohol consump- tion and problems during the transition from high school to college, but did not include items that would allow for event-level associations between alcohol use, blackout inci- dence, and SRT. Future research may want to consider utilizing other measures, such as a modified timeline fol- low-back interview (Sobell & Sobell, 1992), and/or data collection approaches (e.g., diary studies) to examine the intersection of these consequences within discrete drinking events. Another direction may be to examine how SRT and blackout relate to specific drinking events which involve risky styles of drinking and which have a higher probability of blackout. Prior research has identified risk factors for blackout like use of hard alcohol, chugging drinks, and restricting food on drinking days (Lee et al., 2009). Future studies should consider collecting event-level data that cap- tures risky drinking practices with these characteristics, like pregaming or drunkorexia (i.e., limiting food intake before alcohol consumption; Barry & Piazza-Gardner, 2012). In addition, this study focused on three SRT behaviors identi- fied in prior studies (unsafe, unplanned, and regretted) but did not assess other characteristics of sexuality that may differ by gender-blackout group. Future research should consider including measures that allow for a more intensive study of sexual history and recent sexual experiences. For example, alcohol use has been shown to be associated with casual sexual relationships with higher levels of SRT, like hookups, one-night stands, and friends with benefits (Grello et al., 2006; Owen & Fincham, 2011a, 2011b). Future studies may want to include measures to assess these dimen- sions as well, to provide a broader view of how blackouts and gender contribute to participation in these kinds of sexual arrangements.\n8\nHAAS, BARTHEL, AND TAYLOR\nImplications and Final Remarks\nOverall, findings from this study provide direct implica- tions for future research, prevention, and intervention efforts. This study adds to the growing literature implicating consequences associated with escalations in overall risk taking, as well as drinking, during the precollege transition. Results highlight that SRT while drinking occurs at rela- tively high base rates during this time frame, and that black- outs and engagement in multiple kinds of SRT, including unwanted, unsafe, and regretted acts, are related through alcohol use.\nFindings also emphasize that women are at greater risk, despite drinking less. As such, prevention efforts should emphasize consequences associated with alcohol use with gender differences in mind and emphasize the intersectionality between problems. Though this kind of psychoeducation occurs in many existing campus pre- vention programs through commercially available online programming, additional materials may enhance under- standing and/or integration of this information into women\xe2\x80\x99s drinking and the role of alcohol in their sexual decision making. For example, campuses may want to consider creating posters or similar media with informa- tion about gender differences in alcohol metabolism, which could be posted in common areas on campus throughout the year. Comparable media could be intro- duced to highlight the problem of blackout, consent, and sexual practices engaged in while under the influence. Such media could provide education around different BACs and level of alcohol consumption for blackouts to occur in men and women, as well as dose-dependent information about when decision making and consent may be impaired. Similar campaigns have been used in conjunction with alcohol-related social norms interven- tions with some success (Glider, Midyett, Mills-Novoa, Johannessen, & Collins, 2001). Though by no means a solution, media like this are low cost and, if developed in a manner that appeals to students, may help mitigate risk on campus. While prevention efforts geared toward college entry are important, given the diverse concerns that young adults transitioning out of high school face, intervention programs designed for high school students during their final semester should be considered, given the numerous opportunities this population has for risky behaviors. Such a program may help reduce risk of increased engagement during the transitional period. While many universities offer programs for incoming freshmen, programs targeting students while they are still in high school and during their transition to college may be a more effective approach (Fromme et al., 2008). Applying the aforementioned prevention strategies at school assemblies or requiring small group format infor- mation sessions on blackouts and SRT may be a way to help educate transitional youth.\nReferences\nSEX AND DRUGS AND STARTING SCHOOL\nAbbey, A., Ross, L.

Results: Past-year use of marijuana was most common among illicit drugs (26%), followed by misuse of medication (9%) and use of other illicit drugs (8%). During the past month, alcohol use was reported by more than one third (35%), binge drinking by 27%, and cigarette smoking by 19%. Results further show that substance use varied somewhat by demographic characteristics. Results from the latent class analysis of polysubstance use indicated a four-class solution as the best-fitting model; class 1 (59%) included the nonuser group; class 2 (23%) comprised the predominant alcohol user group; class 3 (11%) formed the predominant marijuana user group; and class 4 (8%) was characterized as the predominant polysubstance user group. Somatic and depressive symptoms varied significantly by class membership, with predominant polysubstance users reporting elevated levels of somatic and depressive symptoms. Conclusions: The findings from this national study of 10th-grade students indicate high rates of substance and polysubstance use. The high level of depressive and somatic symptoms among polysubstance users indicates the need for mental health screening and referral.\nIMPLICATIONS AND CONTRIBUTION\nThese findings underscore the ubiquitous yet hetero- geneous nature of adoles- cent substance use and reveal that the multiple classes of substance users differ in terms of use patterns, somatic reports, and depressive symptom- atology. The differences among classes implicate polysubstance use as a broad indicator of severity deserving research and clinical attention.\nPublished by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of Society for\nNational epidemiological studies estimate that most adoles- cents will engage in some form of substance use by the time they graduate from high school.

The findings of MTF further show that adolescent users tend to report using a variety of specific substances at an early age. Among 10th graders, for example, rates of past-year use were 49.8% for alcohol, 28.8% for marijuana/hashish, 6.6% for amphetamines, and a range from 2.6% to 5.9% for misuse of medications (e.g., oxycodone HCl, cough medicine) [1].\nPolysubstance use, defined as using multiple substances within a specified period of time, remains an understudied\nwww.jahonline.org\ncharacteristic of youthful substance use [2e6]. Previous findings on polysubstance use come largely from studies applying latent class analyses (LCAs) to identify multiple classes or groups of adolescents, defined by their patterns of substance use. Among the school-based surveys of adolescents in middle or high school, between 15% and 39% of adolescents could be classified as polysubstance users. Precise estimates varied by sample, reporting period, and definition of polysubstance use [2e6]. Results from the 2005 Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance (YRBS) [6] depict four classes based on past-month use among grades 9e12, as follows: alcohol experimenters (38%), nonusers/ abstainers (27%), occasional polysubstance users (23%), and frequent polysubstance users (13%). The 2001e2002 Add Health data [5] identified five classes of students in grades 7e12 based on use during the past month or year: low use (55%), alcohol only (15%), alcohol or marijuana (8%), cigarettes (8%), and three- substance use (14%) [5]. Given that medication is now the most commonly abused substance after alcohol, marijuana, and tobacco [1,7], it seems both timely and useful that these substances be examined separately to better characterize contemporary patterns of use.\nIn addition to examining prevalence of classes defined by polysubstance use, several studies have linked adolescent poly- substance use with deleterious outcomes, including substance dependence [4], smoking in adulthood [5], and risky sexual behavior [6]. Furthermore, many studies have reported that substance abuse commonly co-occurs with mental health problems in epidemiologic samples of adults [8e12] and adolescents [13e15], with psychopathology onset often predat- ing substance abuse [13,14,16]. However, past research has been limited in two key ways. First, most studies focus on a specific substance (e.g., cannabis) or on substance use at an aggregate level (e.g., any substance use), rather than a more detailed characterization based on profiles of polysubstance use. Second, most studies of comorbidity report disorder-level associations between specific substance use disorders and specific psychiatric disorders [9e11] or between any substance use disorder and specific psychiatric disorders [8,12]. Although polysubstance use has been associated with depressive symptoms in college students [17], to our knowledge only two studies examined polysubstance use and depressive symptoms among adolescents [3,5]. Additional research is needed not only on the association between adolescent polysubstance use and depressive symp- tomatology in particular, but also on somatic reports such as headaches, stomachaches, and other musculoskeletal pains, which are common expressions of underlying depression in adolescents [18,19].\nThe purposes of the current study are threefold: (1) to examine the prevalence and demographic correlates of substance use; (2) to identify classes and subgroups according to substance use patterns; and (3) to examine associations between classes and subgroups and depressive and somatic symptoms.\nMethods\nThe NEXT Generation Health Study is a longitudinal study of a cohort of 10th-grade United States (U.S.) students beginning in spring 2010. School-based assessments included a survey of health behaviors with a focus on four areas: obesity and obesity-related behaviors (e.g., physical activity, sedentary behavior, diet, and sleep), substance use, dating violence, and driving.\nSample and procedure\nWe recruited a nationally representative cohort of U.S. students in grade 10 using a multistage stratified design. Primary-sampling units consisted of school districts or groups of school districts stratified across the nine U.S. Census divi- sions. Within this sampling framework, we randomly selected and formally recruited 137 schools; 80 (58.4%) agreed to participate. We randomly selected 10th-grade classes within each recruited school and recruited 3,796 students to partici- pate; we obtained youth assent and parental consent from 2,619 students (69.0%). Of those consented, 2,524 completed the Wave 1 (baseline) survey, for an overall completion rate of 66.5%. We oversampled African-American students to provide better prevalence estimates and permit comparisons across subpopulations; given the prevalence of Hispanic youth in this sample, the cohort already included an adequate sample of Hispanic youth to meet these criteria. In Wave 1, trained research assistants in the 10th-grade classrooms administered confidential self-report surveys. The Institutional Review Board of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development reviewed and approved the study protocol.\nMeasures\nDemographics. Students provided information about race/ ethnicity and family composition. Parents of youth provided parental education via a paper survey completed when they gave informed consent for their child\xe2\x80\x99s participation. The item, ob- tained from the Add Health study, indicates the highest grade completed at the time of the interview.\nSubstance use. Prevalence in the past month was reported separately for cigarette smoking, alcohol use, and binge drinking. On a 7-point scale (1 1\xe2\x81\x844 never; 2 1\xe2\x81\x844 once or twice; 3 1\xe2\x81\x844 three to five times;41\xe2\x81\x844sixtoninetimes;51\xe2\x81\x84410to19times;61\xe2\x81\x84420e39 times; and 7 1\xe2\x81\x844 !40 times), respondents reported on how many occasions in the past 30 days they had smoked cigarettes and on how many occasions they drank alcohol. To assess binge drinking,ona6-pointscale(11\xe2\x81\x844none;21\xe2\x81\x8441;31\xe2\x81\x8442;41\xe2\x81\x8443e5;51\xe2\x81\x844 6e9; 6 1\xe2\x81\x844 !10 times) respondents reported how many times in the past month they had four or more (females) or five or more (males) drinks in a row on an occasion. The alcohol questions came from the European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs and the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health study (Add Health), with the measure of binge drinking conforming to the NIAAA standard [20]. Prevalence in the past year was reported separately for marijuana/hashish use, medi- cation use to get high, and other illicit drug use. On a 7-point scale(11\xe2\x81\x844never;21\xe2\x81\x844onceortwice;31\xe2\x81\x8443e5times;41\xe2\x81\x844sixto nine times; 5 1\xe2\x81\x844 10 to 19 times; 6 1\xe2\x81\x844 20e39 times; 7 1\xe2\x81\x844 !40 times), respondents reported how often in the past 12 months they had used marijuana, ecstasy, amphetamines (methamphetamine, ice, glass, and speed), opiates (heroin, morphine, and smack), medication to get high, cocaine, glue or solvents, lysergic acid diethylamide, anabolic steroids, and other drugs (open-ended). For reporting prevalence of substance use and conducting LCAs, we created six dichotomous variables (never vs. ever used during past month or past year) on cigarette smoking, alcohol use, binge drinking, marijuana use, medication misuse, and other illicit drug use.\nK.P.

Depressive symptom- atology was assessed by a self-reported screener for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorderse3rd Edition, Revised depression [21]. On a 5-point scale (1 1\xe2\x81\x844 never; 2 1\xe2\x81\x844 seldom; 3 1\xe2\x81\x844 sometimes; 4 1\xe2\x81\x844 often; and 5 1\xe2\x81\x844 always), respondents reported how often they endorsed the following six items over the past 30 days: feeling very sad, feeling grouchy/irritable or in a bad mood, feeling hopeless about the future, feeling like not eating or eating more than usual, sleeping a lot more or a lot less than usual, and experiencing difficulty concentrating on schoolwork. The internal reliability of this scale was high (Cronbach a 1\xe2\x81\x844 .82). In addition, somatic symptoms were assessed through self- report [22]. On a 5-point scale (1 1\xe2\x81\x844 rarely or never; 2 1\xe2\x81\x844 about every month; 3 1\xe2\x81\x844 about every week; 4 1\xe2\x81\x844 more than once a week; and 5 1\xe2\x81\x844 about every day), respondents reported how often they endorsed the following four items over the past 6 months: having a headache, having a stomachache, having a backache, and feeling dizzy. The internal reliability of this scale was moderate (Cronbach a 1\xe2\x81\x844 .70).\nAnalytical approach\nWe conducted a series of LCAs in two steps. The first step was to choose the optimal number of classes by specifying separate LCA models with various numbers of classes. We tested the models with and without demographic covariates, which included gender, race/ethnicity, and parent education. We first conducted the most parsimonious one-class model, and then estimated successive models with two to five classes. For LCA with covariates, with class membership as outcome and demographic variables as predictors, the model is analo- gous to a logistic or multinomial logistic regression. We compared models on a series of statistical fit indices, as well as conceptual considerations: (1) We compared information criteria, including the Akaike Information Criterion [23], Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) [24], and sample size adjusted BIC (ABIC); (2) Pearson and likelihood ratio chi-square statistics were reported, with nonsignificant p values indicating good fit; (3) the selected model should have adequate classifi- cation quality, as shown by relative entropy and average clas- sification probabilities (ACPs) with entropy (ACP values near 1 indicate high certainty and reliability in the classification); and (4) we considered the practical interpretability of the classes in comparing models with similarly adequate fit statis- tics. More weight was given to BIC and ABIC in choosing the number of classes, because a recent simulation study has shown that BIC performs better than other information criteria and likelihood ratio tests in identifying the appropriate number of latent classes [25]. After we chose the appropriate number of classes, we compared depressive and somatic symptoms across the extracted latent classes. We used the posterior probability-based multiple imputations to conduct paired mean comparisons.\nWe used the statistical software package Mplus 6.1 [26] for model-fitting. To accommodate the complex sampling structure of the data, we examined LCA models with stratification, cluster, and sampling weights. Furthermore, Mplus enabled us to make use of all available data, including cases with some missing responses, through estimation by Full Information Maximum Likelihood [27]. We compared depressive and somatic symptoms across latent class membership with the AUXILIARY option in Mplus.\nResults\nSample\nThe demographic characteristics of the sample appear in Table 1. There were slightly more females than males: 54.4% female and 45.6% male. Race/ethnicity, parent education, family structure, and region of residence in the U.S. are also reported.\nTable 2 lists the prevalence of substance use, by sex, race, parent education, family structure, and geographic region. Of the 2,524 respondents, 29% reported using any illicit drugs in the past year (data not shown). During the past month, 35% reported alcohol use, 27% binge drinking, and 19% cigarette smoking. Past- year use of marijuana was 26%, misuse of medication was 9%, and other illicit drugs (e.g., ecstasy, amphetamine, lysergic acid diethylamide, opiates, cocaine, anabolic steroids, glue/solvents) was 8%.\nOther findings indicate that substance use varied somewhat by demographic characteristics. Marijuana use was more prev- alent among males than females. Compared with whites, Hispanics and those in the \xe2\x80\x9cOther\xe2\x80\x9d race/ethnicity category (including Asians, Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders, and American Indians/Alaska Natives) were more likely to use other illicit drugs. There were several differences by parent education cate- gory. For example, the prevalence of marijuana use, cigarette smoking, and binge drinking was lower among children of parents with graduate degrees compared with high school diploma or graduate equivalency diploma. By family structure, significantly lower prevalence was found among children with biological parents than children whose family structure falls into other categories, including stepparents (marijuana use, other\nTable 1\nSample characteristics of NEXT Generation Health Study (N 1\xe2\x81\x844 2,524)\n Categories n Weighted % SE\n Gender (N 1\xe2\x81\x844 2,519) Male\nFemale\nRace/ethnicity (N 1\xe2\x81\x844 2,510)\nWhite African-American Hispanic\nOthera\nAsian\nHawaiian/Pacific Islander American Indian/Alaskan Native\nParent education (highest of both) (N 1\xe2\x81\x844 2,361) Less than high school diploma\nHigh school/graduate equivalency diploma Some college or technical school\nBachelor\xe2\x80\x99s degree\nGraduate degree\nFamily structure (N 1\xe2\x81\x844 2,524)\nBoth biological Stepparents\nSingle parentemother Single parentefather Others\n1,132 45.6 1.7 1,387 54.4 1.7\n1,092 57.9 5.5 485 17.5 3.7 801 19.6 3.3 132 4.9 1.1\n79 1.7 .5 13 .4 .2 40 2.8 1.0\n334 8.4 2.0 602 25.1 2.1 865 39.7 1.7 321 14.4 1.6 239 12.4 2.0\n1,320 52.1 2.2 419 19.2 1.3 457 16.8 1.6\n59 2.7 .6 269 9.2 1.1\n1,098 39.3 3.4 Northeast 368 17.0 4.1 West 682 24.7 2.8 Midwest 376 19.0 3.3\nRegion (N 1\xe2\x81\x844 2,524) South\n  SE 1\xe2\x81\x844 standard error.\na \xe2\x80\x9cOther\xe2\x80\x9d includes Asians, Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders, and American Indians/\nAlaskan Natives.\nK.P.

Categories with significant differences are bolded. For example, there was a significant racial/ethnic difference with regard to preva- lence of other illicit drug. Further contrast analyses showed a significant difference between whites and Hispanics, and between whites and other racial/ethnic groups.\nillicit drug use, cigarette smoking, binge drinking), single father (cigarette smoking), and other family structure (marijuana use, other illicit drug use, and cigarette smoking). In addition, chil- dren from single-mother families reported lower use of other illicit drugs compared with stepparents and other family struc- ture. Last, prevalence of smoking cigarettes was lower among those living in the Northeast than the Midwest.\nLatent classes\nTable 3 lists results of fit statistics for LCA models with one to five classes, and for the LCA with covariates models with two to five classes. Pearson and likelihood chi-square statistics test departure of the model from the observed data, and were significant for models with one to three classes, but not for models with four or five classes. In terms of the information criteria, the four-class solution without covariates had the minimum values on BIC and ABIC, and the four-class solution with covariates had the minimum values on BIC. In addition, the four-class solution also had acceptably high values on entropy (without covariates, .832; with covariates, .806) and ACPs (without covariates, range .869e.921; with covariates, range .846e.915). Thus, by model fit statistics, we chose the four-class solution as the best-fitting model. An examination on class\ninterpretability for models with two to five classes further indi- cates the four-class model as optimal in terms of practical implication and distinctiveness of each latent class.\nFor the four-class solution of LCA with covariates, Figure 1 reports the latent class prevalence (i.e., the proportion of the sample composing each class) and item probability (i.e., the likelihood of reporting each behavior within a particular latent class). Adolescents in class 1 (59.3%) formed the nonuser group, with very low probabilities of using any of the substances, such as medication to get high (.000), illicit drugs (.006), cigarettes (.007), marijuana (.019), alcohol (.071), and binge drinking (.023). Adolescents in class 2 (22.6%) comprised the predominant alcohol user group, with high probability of drinking (.982) and moderately high probability of binge drinking (.735), moderate probabilities of using marijuana (.418) and smoking cigarettes (.413), and low probabilities of misusing medication (.074) and using other illicit drugs (.066). Adolescents in class 3 (10.5%) formed the predominant mari- juana user group, with much higher probability of using marijuana (.578) than using other substances, such as ciga- rettes (.270) or medication to get high (.139) or other illicit drugs (.156), and virtually no use of alcohol (.000) or binge drinking (.076).

We did not adjust for covariates in this analysis. Nonusers reported significantly lower levels of depressive and somatic symptoms than any other class: predominant polysubstance users (p < .01), predominant alcohol users (p < .01), and predominant marijuana users (p < .05). Predominant polysubstance users reported significantly (p < .01) higher levels of depressive and somatic symptoms than those in all other classes. Predominant alcohol users and predominant marijuana users did not significantly differ in their reports of depressive or somatic symptoms.\nDiscussion\nThe primary study findings are that (1) there were four classes of drug users: nonusers, predominant drinkers, marijuana users, and polysubstance users; and (2) the predominant poly- substance users scored higher on depressive and somatic symptomatology. The overall prevalence of substance use in this sample is consistent with other national studies, such as the Monitoring the Future Study, and highlights its ubiquitousness among American youth. Past-year rates of marijuana use among 10th graders, for example, were similar between the NEXT study (26%) and the 2011 MTF study (29%) [1]. Past-year rates of medication misuse among 10th graders were slightly higher in the NEXT study (8.7%) compared with the 2011 MTF study (range, 2.6%e5.9%). This difference may stem from a definitional differ- ence of medication misuse: NEXT asks about use of \xe2\x80\x9cmedication to get high,\xe2\x80\x9d whereas MTF asks about use of specific medications (e.g., oxycodone HCl, hydrocodone/paracetamol, methylpheni- date) \xe2\x80\x9cnot under a doctor\xe2\x80\x99s orders.\xe2\x80\x9d\nRegarding noteworthy demographic factors associated with substance use, children who live with both biological parents were less likely than children who live with stepparents to use marijuana, medication to get high, other illicit drugs, or ciga- rettes, and to binge drink. This finding is consistent with the well-supported notion that lack of parental monitoring is a risk factor for substance use [7,28].\nThe multiple classes defined by polysubstance use reported here compare with other studies [5,6] and underscore the considerable heterogeneity that exists among young substance users. In our sample, as in Add Health, abstainers comprised the largest and majority class of substance users [5]. By comparison, in the 2009 YRBS, with a wider age range in the sample, alcohol users formed the largest class [6]. All three studies found that polysubstance users formed a smaller class of youth: NEXT, with 7.6% of the sample characterized as predominant polysubstance users; YRBS, with 13% frequent polysubstance users and 23% occasional polysubstance users; and Add Health, with 14% three-substance users. Both the NEXT and YRBS identified that one polydrug class stood apart from the others in the serious- ness of their substance use patterns, symptomatology, and risk behaviors [6].\nIn addition to these findings, several results are particu- larly important and novel.

We excluded family structure and region because of possible multi co-linearity (with race/ethnicity and parent education) and the negative impact on statistical power of including many covariates. We set the non- user class as the reference group. Table 4 reports the results. Females were less likely than males to be in the predominant marijuana user compared with the nonuser class (odds ratio [OR] 1\xe2\x81\x844 .34; confidence interval [CI] .18e.65).

Medication misuse is associated with serious adverse consequences including addiction and unintentional overdose [29,30]. Second, the predominant poly- substance users reported binge drinking at rates equal to, or even higher than, predominant alcohol users. Binge drinking during adolescence is a hazardous practice associated with significant short-term and long-term negative consequences [31,32]. Whereas our study measured the use of various substances over a period of time and not simultaneous poly- substance use (e.g., misusing medications while drinking alcohol), other research reported high rates and negative consequences of simultaneous use in adolescents and college students [17,33]. Third, the predominant polysubstance users reported elevated levels of depressive symptoms and more somatic problems such as headaches, stomachaches, and back- aches, which often underlie depression [18,19]. The association of polysubstance use with mental health symptoms is con- cerning, because comorbid depressive psychopathology often predicts substance use, worsened clinical course, and medical illnesses among substance abusers [34e36]. Our findings\nstrongly suggest that polysubstance users in the 10th grade may already be experiencing significant impairments and may be at high risk for deleterious outcomes, an interpretation warranting confirmation by longitudinal analysis. Finally, polysubstance use may be a broad indicator of severity prevalent in over 7% of 10th graders. There is a need to reinforce the call for better substance use and mental health screening as well as referral to and availability of care, as recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics Association and the Society for Adolescent Medi- cine [37e39].\nThe results reported here should be considered in light of several limitations and strengths. Study limitations include the somewhat attenuated response rate, limited sample size relative to other national epidemiological studies, and cross-sectional design. The strengths include the nationally representative sampling frame, oversampling of African-American and Hispanic youth to allow for robust comparisons across certain race/ethnic groups, assessment of depressive and somatic symptoms, and the examination of misuse of medications separately from other illicit drugs.\n722 K.P.

Methods: Analyses use questionnaire data collected from 1998 to 2011 from 89,575 students in 883 middle schools and 157,400 students in 1,463 high schools to examine: (1) the current prevalence of SDT; (2) SDT trends over time; (3) associations between substance use and SDT type, volume, or duration among the general student population or students participating in activities subject to testing; (4) associations between students\xe2\x80\x99 beliefs/attitudes about marijuana use and SDT; and (5) associations between extracurricular participation rates and SDT.\nResults: Moderately lower marijuana use was associated with any random testing of the general high school student population and for SDT of middle and high school sub-populations specifically subject to testing (athletes or participants in nonathletic extracurricular activities). However, SDT generally was associated with increased use of illicit drugs other than marijuana.\nConclusions: Because the study design is observational and the data are cross-sectional, no strong causal conclusions can be drawn. However, there is evidence of lower marijuana use in the presence of SDT, and evidence of higher use of illicit drugs other than marijuana. Until further research can clarify the apparent opposing associations, schools should approach SDT with caution.\n! 2013 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

Random testing can be mandatory for certain groups (e.g., athletes or others taking part in competitive extracurricular activities), mandatory for all students, or voluntary. The primary theoretical underpinning of SDT is\n* Address correspondence to: Ms. Yvonne M.

More broadly, SDT is hypothesized to reduce and/or prevent drug use through: (a) counseling/education/treatment intervention opportunities; (b) opportunities for cessation or non-initiation to avoid test consequences; and (c) support for students to say no to peer pressure to use [2,3]. Proponents of SDT emphasize testing should be part of comprehensive programming efforts, and that the purpose is not to punish students for drug use, but to prevent use or enable intervention for students who test positive [2,3]. Concerns regarding SDT include: testing efficacy;\n1054-139X/$ e see front matter ! 2013 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

Terry-McElrath et al. / Journal of Adolescent Health 52 (2013) 707e715\nfinancial costs; testing accuracy; student avoidance of extra- curricular activities to avoid testing; student use of drugs less likely to be detected; violation of privacy; Fourth Amend- ment protection against unreasonable searches; and potential undermining of student trust and harming the student-school relationship [4,5].\nResearch on SDT efficacy in deterring drug use has not been definitive. One 2009 review found little support for SDT in deterring use [1]. A recent national survey found SDT effects were conditioned on school climate and student gender [6]. An experimental evaluation found significantly lower use of the specific substances tested for among students in treatment schools compared to students in control schools, but no significant differences in overall substance use [7]. Random athlete SDT was not associated with past 30-day student athlete substance use in a separate randomized controlled study, but some evidence was found for reduced past-year use [8]. Studies that observed substance use reductions did not observe signif- icant differences in intentions to use [7] and found some evidence of increased drug-use risk factors [8]. The literature has not shown significant SDT effects among students in schools with testing programs who were not themselves subject to testing [7,9]. One nationally representative cross-sectional sample of middle and high school students from 1998e2001/ 2002 [10,11] found no significant differences in student substance use based on testing, but did find suggestive evidence for a decline in marijuana use but a possible increase in use of illicit drugs other than marijuana. A later study using 2005 data [12] estimated that 14% of public school districts with high schools used random SDT, with almost all of those districts reporting testing athletes, 65% testing other extracurricular participants, and 28% testing all students (student drug use was not examined).\nThe current study uses 14 years of nationally representative data from U.S. middle and high school students in public and private schools to examine five general research areas: first, current SDT prevalence and trends followed by associations between SDT and (a) student illicit substance use among the general student population; (b) illicit substance use among student groups subject to testing; (c) marijuana use beliefs and attitudes; and (d) extracurricular participation rates.\nMethods\nParticipants\nStudent data were obtained from the Monitoring the Future (MTF) study (supported by the National Institute on Drug Abuse), consisting of nationally representative samples of 8th, 10th, and 12th grade students [13]. School data were obtained from administrators in MTF schools through the Youth, Educa- tion, and Society (YES) study (supported by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation). Both studies were conducted by the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan (approval obtained from the University of Michigan Behavioral Sciences Institutional Review Board) and appropriate consent procedures were used.\nProcedure\nSelf-completed, optically scanned student questionnaires were administered in classrooms by University of Michigan\npersonnel during a normal class period (detailed information on MTF methodology is provided elsewhere) [13,14]. From 1998e2011, the overall school response rate (with replacement) averaged 98%; student response rates averaged 89%, 87%, and 82% for 8th, 10th, and 12th grades, respectively. Absenteeism was the primary reason for missing data; less than 1% of students refused participation.\nMailed questionnaires with a monetary incentive were sent to each sampled school\xe2\x80\x99s principal in the spring of the same year in which student data were gathered. School administrator response rates averaged 83%. At the start of the study, pilot testing of various school policy measures was conducted with a convenience sample of secondary school principals. Although detailed reliability and validity studies of measures used were not conducted, participants reported no difficulty completing the measures.\nThe merged MTF and YES dataset for 1998e2011 had approximately 103,000 8th grade students in 887 schools; 90,000 10th grade students in 731 schools; and 83,000 12th grade students in 745 schools.\nInstruments\nStudent outcomes. Past 30-day marijuana use frequency was assessed on a 7-point scale (1 1\xe2\x81\x844 0 occasions; 2 1\xe2\x81\x844 1e2; 3 1\xe2\x81\x844 3e5; 4 1\xe2\x81\x844 6e9; 5 1\xe2\x81\x844 10e19; 6 1\xe2\x81\x844 20e39; and 7 1\xe2\x81\x844 40\xc3\xbe occasions). Students were also asked about past 30-day frequency of LSD use, other psychedelics, cocaine, heroin, amphetamines, and tranquilizers. For 12th graders, two additional substances were included: sedatives/barbiturates and narcotics other than heroin. A mean was taken from these items to create a scale of frequency of use of illicit drugs other than marijuana (OTM).\nFour outcomes investigated marijuana-related attitudes and beliefs. Two dichotomous items measured perceived risk of physical or other harms from using marijuana as great (vs. none/ slight/moderate) for (a) occasional use; and (b) regular use. Two additional dichotomous items measured any personal disapproval of people who use marijuana (a) occasionally; and (b) regularly.\nTwo dichotomous items measured moderate or great partic- ipation (vs. not at all/slight) in (a) athletics; and (b) one or more nonathletic extracurricular activities (school newspaper/year- book; music/other performing arts; academic clubs (e.g., science, math, or language); student council/government; other school clubs/activities).\nStudent drug testing policy measures. For all years, school offi- cials were asked, \xe2\x80\x9cIn the [current] school year, did your school test any students for illicit drug use?\xe2\x80\x9d If yes, respondents noted if SDT was used \xe2\x80\x9cbased on suspicion or cause\xe2\x80\x9d and/or \xe2\x80\x9croutine or random.\xe2\x80\x9d Three dichotomous indicators were created: (a) any SDT; (b) any for-cause SDT; and (c) any random SDT. Schools with random SDT where all students were eligible for testing were identified. Volume of for-cause SDT was first asked in 1999: \xe2\x80\x9cIn the [current] school year, about how many students were tested for drugs based on suspicion or cause?\xe2\x80\x9d Volume of any random SDT was first asked in 2003: \xe2\x80\x9cIn the [current] school year, about how many students were given a random drug test?\xe2\x80\x9d Respondents recorded a number for both items. Only schools with at least one such test were included in models examining testing volume associations with student substance-related outcomes.\nStarting in 1999, school officials were asked which student groups were tested. Responses included: \xe2\x80\x9cstudents participating on an athletic team (not including tests for performance- enhancing drugs)\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cstudents participating in another extracurricular activity\xe2\x80\x9d; dichotomous variables for any testing among these two groups were created. Starting in 2004, school officials were asked two questions specific to random SDT: [1] \xe2\x80\x9cWhen was random drug testing of students first imple- mented in your school?\xe2\x80\x9d (this school year; last school year; 2e3 years ago; more than 3 years ago); and [2] \xe2\x80\x9cSpecifically, what groups of students are subject to random drug testing in your school?\xe2\x80\x9d with responses for \xe2\x80\x9cathletes\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cparticipants in extracurricular activities other than athletics\xe2\x80\x9d; dichotomous variables for random testing among these two groups were created.\nControl variables. Student characteristics known to relate to drug use were used as controls [15]: gender; race/ethnicity (African- American, Hispanic, white, or other); two-parent family; parental education (based on the average of father\xe2\x80\x99s and mother\xe2\x80\x99s education). School-level controls included school level (middle school (8th grade) or high school (10th or 12th grades)); grade; sector (public or private); number of students in the grade surveyed; percentage of students eligible for free and reduced- price lunch; majority student race/ethnicity; population density; region.\nData analysis\nDescriptive analyses were conducted in SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Carry, NC) using survey commands to account for clustering by school in estimates of standard errors. Two-level hierarchical multivariate models were run using HLM (Scientifc Software International, Inc., Skokie, IL). Drug use frequency outcomes were modeled using restricted maximum likelihood and robust stan- dard errors. Dichotomous outcomes were modeled using a Ber- noulli distribution log-link function; population average model results with robust standard errors are reported. All analyses were weighted to adjust for differential probability of selection. Results are presented separately for middle and high schools.\nResults\nAnalytic sample\nAfter limiting cases to those with no missing data on control variables, 89,575 students in 883 middle schools, and 157,400 students in 1,463 high schools remained for analysis.\nCurrent student drug testing prevalence and trends\nFor 1998 to 2011 combined, 14% of middle and 28% of high school students attended schools with any SDT; rates for for-cause testing were 10% and 22%, and for any random testing were 6% and 10% (see Table 1). If any for-cause testing had occurred, the volume of students tested in the current year averaged 6 per school for middle and 17 per school for high school students. If any random testing had occurred, the average number of students tested was 80 per school for middle and 178 per school for high school students. Within schools with any random SDT, testing had been in place for more than 3 years for more than half of students (66% middle school; 58% high school);\nfor 2e3 years for approximately one-quarter of students (25% middle school; 29% high school); and implemented in the last or current school year for 9% of middle and 14% of high school students. Few students (2%) attended schools with random drug testing among all students.\nStudent drug testing showed a mix of linear and nonlinear trends over time; data were grouped as follows to allow for consistent modeling across SDT type: 1998e2001, 2002e2004, 2005e2007, and 2008e2011. The percentage of students attending schools with any for-cause SDT did not change signifi- cantly over time. For middle school students, any random SDT increased from 2% in 1998e2001 to 9% in 2005e2007 (p < .01), remaining at 9% through 2008e2011. The percentage of high school students with any random SDT increased from 6% in 1998e2001 to 11% in 2005e2007 (p < .05) to 14% in 2008e2011 (p < .001).\nFor 1998 to 2011 combined, 6% of middle and 11% of high school students attended schools with any athlete SDT; 3% and 7% attended schools with any nonathlete extracurricular SDT. Strong overlap existed between athlete and nonathlete extra- curricular SDT. Over half of students in schools with any athlete testing also had any nonathlete extracurricular SDT (52% of middle and 58% of high school students); almost all students in schools with any nonathlete extracurricular SDT also had any athlete SDT (90% of middle and 92% of high school students). Any student athletic testing rose from 3% in 1998e2001 to 8% in 2008e2011 (p < .05) for middle school students and from 8% to 15% (p < .05) for high school students. Any nonathlete extra- curricular SDT rose from 1% in 1998e2001 to 6% in 2008e2011 (p < .05) for middle school students and from 4% to 10% (p < .01) for high school students. The average percentage of students attending schools with random athlete SDT was 8% and 11% for middle and high school students, respectively, and 5% and 7% for random nonathlete extracurricular SDT from 2004e2011.\nStudent drug testing and substance use among the general student population\nTable 2 presents results from models relating SDT to student substance use, controlling for student- and school-level measures. Due to low middle school prevalence of SDT in general and the very low prevalence of random testing among all students, middle school models did not examine SDT volume, timing of random SDT implementation, or prevalence of random SDT among all students.\nPast 30-day marijuana and OTM use were not significantly associated with SDT type among the general middle school student population. Within the general high school student population, any for-cause SDT was associated with significantly higher marijuana use frequency and prevalence and OTM prev- alence. However, within schools with any for-cause SDT, as the volume of testing increased, marijuana use frequency decreased. Any random SDT was associated with significantly lower mari- juana use frequency and prevalence. However, any random SDT was associated with significantly higher OTM use frequency and prevalence, and random SDT among all students was associated with significantly higher OTM use prevalence. The volume of random testing was not associated with either marijuana or OTM use among high school students attending schools with such testing.

Among high school students participating in nonathletic extracurricular activities,\nmarijuana use prevalence was significantly and negatively associated with any SDT and any random SDT aimed at this group.

The current analyses found that any for- cause testing was associated with higher marijuana and OTM use\nTable 4\nSummary of significant multivariate associations (p < .05) between school drug testing and student illicit substance use and related measures\nand lower perceived risk/disapproval of marijuana use. Yet, among students attending schools with any for-cause testing, higher for-cause testing volume was associated with lower marijuana use and higher disapproval. For-cause testing is based on appearance or behavior indicative of substance use. School- level substance use has been shown to relate to the likelihood a student will personally engage in substance use [16e18]; students attending schools with for-cause SDT may be at higher risk of substance use due to a priori higher school use. The inverse testing volume-marijuana use relationship, however, indicates that once potential a priori higher use rates are accounted for by limiting the sample to only those schools with for-cause testing, a negative association between SDT volume and marijuana usedbut not OTM usedwas observed. Throughout the models, the desired association of lower drug use with SDT seemed to occur primarily with marijuana use under the conditions of any random testing in the general student population or in specific sub-populations subject to testing. The intent of SDT as a deterrent to OTM use appears not to be supported. Indeed, these results suggest that SDT may be associated with increased OTM use.\nLittle prior research examined differences in SDT-drug use associations across illicit substances. Of the significant literature contributions previously noted [1,6e11], only one study exam- ined associations separately for marijuana and other illicit drugs [10,11]. That study (which also utilized MTF data, but only for 1998e2002), found no significant results but did observe suggestive evidence of a decline in marijuana use coupled with a possible increase in OTM use. Those early findings were repli- cated in the current study and found to be significant with inclusion of 14 years of data. Literature on SDT efficacy generally indicates little association with illicit drug use among the general population [1,6e7,9] with some evidence for targeted student populations (7e9) for marijuana alone or in combination with other illicit drugs. In the current study, the higher predicted probabilities of OTM use associated with having various types of SDT were modestdranging from 1 to 2 percentage points across high school SDT types and population groups, compared with a modest 3 to 4 percentage point reduction in high school marijuana use. If marijuana and OTM were combined into one measure of illicit drug use, models would likely show little significance given the opposing nature of the associations.\nPossible mechanisms underlying the observed differences in SDT associations with marijuana and OTM include the following: (1) students may know that marijuana metabolites remain in the body for a longer time than metabolites of most other drugs, making other drugs less likely to be detected even if included in testing; and/or (2) students may move toward the use of illicit drugs not included in testing. Information on drug test detection times is readily available on the Internet [19e21]; as early as 1990, research indicated that drug-tested college athletes were significantly more knowledgeable than nontested college athletes about SDT detection-avoidance techniques including timing drug use so as to have substances clear their bodies prior to testing [22]. While middle and high school students are not likely to be as sophisticated as college students, it is likely they are aware of detection-avoidance techniques and likely to make use of informal communication networks to convey testing date estimates [22]. One experimental evaluation found that SDT significantly associated with high school student use of substances specifically tested for with no associations for overall substance use [7].\n  1.

Reductions in marijuana use among U.S. students are a highly desirable goal and may be associated with SDT; however, corresponding possible increases in OTM use raise serious concerns. Consider- able financial costs are also associated with conducting SDT, a particularly salient problem in times of economic stress.\nRandom SDT among the general high school student pop- ulation, as well as middle and high school subgroups targeted for testing, was associated with moderately lower marijuana use; however, most forms of testing were associated with moderately higher use of other illicit drugs, particularly in high school. These findings raise the question of whether SDT is worth this apparent tradeoff. Until further research can clarify the appar- ently opposing associations, schools should approach SDT with caution.\nStrengths and limitations\nStudy strengths include large national school and student samples and 14 years of observations, as well as specification of various types of testing, groups eligible for testing, and duration of random SDT implementation. Thirty-day use was chosen to ensure that outcomes occurred within the time period during which the current school year\xe2\x80\x99s drug testing program was operational. Past 12-month drug use outcomes were also examined; results were similar to those for past 30-day use.\nThere are several limitations. This is an observational study in which schools and school districts select themselves into testing or not testing, which may carry some selection bias. However, analyses controlled for a number of known correlates of drug use at both student and school levels, which should substantially reduce selection bias. Data were based neither on a pre-post design nor random assignment to treatment conditions; results do not prove causality. All data were based on self-report measures, but there is considerable evidence that MTF measures are likely largely reliable and valid [13]. Data on when students were subject to testing throughout the school year were not available; current analyses do not account for either the existence or level of implementation of educational drug prevention programming that may impact student substance use.\nAcknowledgments\nThe Monitoring the Future study is supported by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (DA01411), and the Youth, Education, and Society (YES) project is part of a larger research initiative funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, titled Bridging the Gap: Research Informing Policy and Practice for Healthy Youth Behavior.

Methods: Analyses use questionnaire data collected from 1998 to 2011 from 89,575 students in 883 middle schools and 157,400 students in 1,463 high schools to examine: (1) the current prevalence of SDT; (2) SDT trends over time; (3) associations between substance use and SDT type, volume, or duration among the general student population or students participating in activities subject to testing; (4) associations between students\xe2\x80\x99 beliefs/attitudes about marijuana use and SDT; and (5) associations between extracurricular participation rates and SDT.\nResults: Moderately lower marijuana use was associated with any random testing of the general high school student population and for SDT of middle and high school sub-populations specifically subject to testing (athletes or participants in nonathletic extracurricular activities). However, SDT generally was associated with increased use of illicit drugs other than marijuana.\nConclusions: Because the study design is observational and the data are cross-sectional, no strong causal conclusions can be drawn. However, there is evidence of lower marijuana use in the presence of SDT, and evidence of higher use of illicit drugs other than marijuana. Until further research can clarify the apparent opposing associations, schools should approach SDT with caution.\n! 2013 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

More broadly, SDT is hypothesized to reduce and/or prevent drug use through: (a) counseling/education/treatment intervention opportunities; (b) opportunities for cessation or non-initiation to avoid test consequences; and (c) support for students to say no to peer pressure to use [2,3]. Proponents of SDT emphasize testing should be part of comprehensive programming efforts, and that the purpose is not to punish students for drug use, but to prevent use or enable intervention for students who test positive [2,3]. Concerns regarding SDT include: testing efficacy;\n1054-139X/$ e see front matter ! 2013 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

One 2009 review found little support for SDT in deterring use [1]. A recent national survey found SDT effects were conditioned on school climate and student gender [6]. An experimental evaluation found significantly lower use of the specific substances tested for among students in treatment schools compared to students in control schools, but no significant differences in overall substance use [7]. Random athlete SDT was not associated with past 30-day student athlete substance use in a separate randomized controlled study, but some evidence was found for reduced past-year use [8]. Studies that observed substance use reductions did not observe signif- icant differences in intentions to use [7] and found some evidence of increased drug-use risk factors [8]. The literature has not shown significant SDT effects among students in schools with testing programs who were not themselves subject to testing [7,9]. One nationally representative cross-sectional sample of middle and high school students from 1998e2001/ 2002 [10,11] found no significant differences in student substance use based on testing, but did find suggestive evidence for a decline in marijuana use but a possible increase in use of illicit drugs other than marijuana. A later study using 2005 data [12] estimated that 14% of public school districts with high schools used random SDT, with almost all of those districts reporting testing athletes, 65% testing other extracurricular participants, and 28% testing all students (student drug use was not examined).\nThe current study uses 14 years of nationally representative data from U.S. middle and high school students in public and private schools to examine five general research areas: first, current SDT prevalence and trends followed by associations between SDT and (a) student illicit substance use among the general student population; (b) illicit substance use among student groups subject to testing; (c) marijuana use beliefs and attitudes; and (d) extracurricular participation rates.\nMethods\nParticipants\nStudent data were obtained from the Monitoring the Future (MTF) study (supported by the National Institute on Drug Abuse), consisting of nationally representative samples of 8th, 10th, and 12th grade students [13]. School data were obtained from administrators in MTF schools through the Youth, Educa- tion, and Society (YES) study (supported by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation). Both studies were conducted by the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan (approval obtained from the University of Michigan Behavioral Sciences Institutional Review Board) and appropriate consent procedures were used.\nProcedure\nSelf-completed, optically scanned student questionnaires were administered in classrooms by University of Michigan\npersonnel during a normal class period (detailed information on MTF methodology is provided elsewhere) [13,14]. From 1998e2011, the overall school response rate (with replacement) averaged 98%; student response rates averaged 89%, 87%, and 82% for 8th, 10th, and 12th grades, respectively. Absenteeism was the primary reason for missing data; less than 1% of students refused participation.\nMailed questionnaires with a monetary incentive were sent to each sampled school\xe2\x80\x99s principal in the spring of the same year in which student data were gathered. School administrator response rates averaged 83%. At the start of the study, pilot testing of various school policy measures was conducted with a convenience sample of secondary school principals. Although detailed reliability and validity studies of measures used were not conducted, participants reported no difficulty completing the measures.\nThe merged MTF and YES dataset for 1998e2011 had approximately 103,000 8th grade students in 887 schools; 90,000 10th grade students in 731 schools; and 83,000 12th grade students in 745 schools.\nInstruments\nStudent outcomes. Past 30-day marijuana use frequency was assessed on a 7-point scale (1 1\xe2\x81\x844 0 occasions; 2 1\xe2\x81\x844 1e2; 3 1\xe2\x81\x844 3e5; 4 1\xe2\x81\x844 6e9; 5 1\xe2\x81\x844 10e19; 6 1\xe2\x81\x844 20e39; and 7 1\xe2\x81\x844 40\xc3\xbe occasions). Students were also asked about past 30-day frequency of LSD use, other psychedelics, cocaine, heroin, amphetamines, and tranquilizers. For 12th graders, two additional substances were included: sedatives/barbiturates and narcotics other than heroin. A mean was taken from these items to create a scale of frequency of use of illicit drugs other than marijuana (OTM).\nFour outcomes investigated marijuana-related attitudes and beliefs. Two dichotomous items measured perceived risk of physical or other harms from using marijuana as great (vs. none/ slight/moderate) for (a) occasional use; and (b) regular use. Two additional dichotomous items measured any personal disapproval of people who use marijuana (a) occasionally; and (b) regularly.\nTwo dichotomous items measured moderate or great partic- ipation (vs. not at all/slight) in (a) athletics; and (b) one or more nonathletic extracurricular activities (school newspaper/year- book; music/other performing arts; academic clubs (e.g., science, math, or language); student council/government; other school clubs/activities).\nStudent drug testing policy measures. For all years, school offi- cials were asked, \xe2\x80\x9cIn the [current] school year, did your school test any students for illicit drug use?\xe2\x80\x9d If yes, respondents noted if SDT was used \xe2\x80\x9cbased on suspicion or cause\xe2\x80\x9d and/or \xe2\x80\x9croutine or random.\xe2\x80\x9d Three dichotomous indicators were created: (a) any SDT; (b) any for-cause SDT; and (c) any random SDT. Schools with random SDT where all students were eligible for testing were identified. Volume of for-cause SDT was first asked in 1999: \xe2\x80\x9cIn the [current] school year, about how many students were tested for drugs based on suspicion or cause?\xe2\x80\x9d Volume of any random SDT was first asked in 2003: \xe2\x80\x9cIn the [current] school year, about how many students were given a random drug test?\xe2\x80\x9d Respondents recorded a number for both items. Only schools with at least one such test were included in models examining testing volume associations with student substance-related outcomes.\nStarting in 1999, school officials were asked which student groups were tested. Responses included: \xe2\x80\x9cstudents participating on an athletic team (not including tests for performance- enhancing drugs)\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cstudents participating in another extracurricular activity\xe2\x80\x9d; dichotomous variables for any testing among these two groups were created. Starting in 2004, school officials were asked two questions specific to random SDT: [1] \xe2\x80\x9cWhen was random drug testing of students first imple- mented in your school?\xe2\x80\x9d (this school year; last school year; 2e3 years ago; more than 3 years ago); and [2] \xe2\x80\x9cSpecifically, what groups of students are subject to random drug testing in your school?\xe2\x80\x9d with responses for \xe2\x80\x9cathletes\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cparticipants in extracurricular activities other than athletics\xe2\x80\x9d; dichotomous variables for random testing among these two groups were created.\nControl variables. Student characteristics known to relate to drug use were used as controls [15]: gender; race/ethnicity (African- American, Hispanic, white, or other); two-parent family; parental education (based on the average of father\xe2\x80\x99s and mother\xe2\x80\x99s education). School-level controls included school level (middle school (8th grade) or high school (10th or 12th grades)); grade; sector (public or private); number of students in the grade surveyed; percentage of students eligible for free and reduced- price lunch; majority student race/ethnicity; population density; region.\nData analysis\nDescriptive analyses were conducted in SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Carry, NC) using survey commands to account for clustering by school in estimates of standard errors. Two-level hierarchical multivariate models were run using HLM (Scientifc Software International, Inc., Skokie, IL). Drug use frequency outcomes were modeled using restricted maximum likelihood and robust stan- dard errors. Dichotomous outcomes were modeled using a Ber- noulli distribution log-link function; population average model results with robust standard errors are reported. All analyses were weighted to adjust for differential probability of selection. Results are presented separately for middle and high schools.\nResults\nAnalytic sample\nAfter limiting cases to those with no missing data on control variables, 89,575 students in 883 middle schools, and 157,400 students in 1,463 high schools remained for analysis.\nCurrent student drug testing prevalence and trends\nFor 1998 to 2011 combined, 14% of middle and 28% of high school students attended schools with any SDT; rates for for-cause testing were 10% and 22%, and for any random testing were 6% and 10% (see Table 1). If any for-cause testing had occurred, the volume of students tested in the current year averaged 6 per school for middle and 17 per school for high school students. If any random testing had occurred, the average number of students tested was 80 per school for middle and 178 per school for high school students. Within schools with any random SDT, testing had been in place for more than 3 years for more than half of students (66% middle school; 58% high school);\nfor 2e3 years for approximately one-quarter of students (25% middle school; 29% high school); and implemented in the last or current school year for 9% of middle and 14% of high school students. Few students (2%) attended schools with random drug testing among all students.\nStudent drug testing showed a mix of linear and nonlinear trends over time; data were grouped as follows to allow for consistent modeling across SDT type: 1998e2001, 2002e2004, 2005e2007, and 2008e2011. The percentage of students attending schools with any for-cause SDT did not change signifi- cantly over time. For middle school students, any random SDT increased from 2% in 1998e2001 to 9% in 2005e2007 (p < .01), remaining at 9% through 2008e2011. The percentage of high school students with any random SDT increased from 6% in 1998e2001 to 11% in 2005e2007 (p < .05) to 14% in 2008e2011 (p < .001).\nFor 1998 to 2011 combined, 6% of middle and 11% of high school students attended schools with any athlete SDT; 3% and 7% attended schools with any nonathlete extracurricular SDT. Strong overlap existed between athlete and nonathlete extra- curricular SDT. Over half of students in schools with any athlete testing also had any nonathlete extracurricular SDT (52% of middle and 58% of high school students); almost all students in schools with any nonathlete extracurricular SDT also had any athlete SDT (90% of middle and 92% of high school students). Any student athletic testing rose from 3% in 1998e2001 to 8% in 2008e2011 (p < .05) for middle school students and from 8% to 15% (p < .05) for high school students. Any nonathlete extra- curricular SDT rose from 1% in 1998e2001 to 6% in 2008e2011 (p < .05) for middle school students and from 4% to 10% (p < .01) for high school students. The average percentage of students attending schools with random athlete SDT was 8% and 11% for middle and high school students, respectively, and 5% and 7% for random nonathlete extracurricular SDT from 2004e2011.\nStudent drug testing and substance use among the general student population\nTable 2 presents results from models relating SDT to student substance use, controlling for student- and school-level measures. Due to low middle school prevalence of SDT in general and the very low prevalence of random testing among all students, middle school models did not examine SDT volume, timing of random SDT implementation, or prevalence of random SDT among all students.\nPast 30-day marijuana and OTM use were not significantly associated with SDT type among the general middle school student population. Within the general high school student population, any for-cause SDT was associated with significantly higher marijuana use frequency and prevalence and OTM prev- alence. However, within schools with any for-cause SDT, as the volume of testing increased, marijuana use frequency decreased. Any random SDT was associated with significantly lower mari- juana use frequency and prevalence. However, any random SDT was associated with significantly higher OTM use frequency and prevalence, and random SDT among all students was associated with significantly higher OTM use prevalence. The volume of random testing was not associated with either marijuana or OTM use among high school students attending schools with such testing. Among high school students attending schools with any random SDT, implementation of random SDT programs in the current or prior year was associated with higher OTM use frequency than when random SDT was implemented four or\nY.M.

Figure 1 presents predicted probabilities of marijuana and OTM use prevalence among the general high school student population by SDT type.\nStudent drug testing and substance use among student groups subject to testing\nMiddle school student athlete marijuana use frequency was significantly lower in schools with either any athlete SDT or random athlete SDT (Table 2). Among middle school students participating in nonathletic extracurricular activities, random testing aimed at that group was associated with significantly higher odds of OTM use prevalence.\nMarijuana use frequency and prevalence were significantly lower among high school student athletes in schools with either any athlete SDT or random athlete SDT, compared to students in schools with no SDT (Table 2). Among high school students participating in nonathletic extracurricular activities,\nmarijuana use prevalence was significantly and negatively associated with any SDT and any random SDT aimed at this group. OTM use frequency was significantly and positively associated with any SDT testing targeting such students. Figure 2 presents predicted probabilities of past 30-day mari- juana and OTM use prevalence among high school student athletes and other extracurricular participants by any SDT for these specific populations.\nStudent drug testing and marijuana-related attitudes and beliefs\nModels investigating relationships between SDT and perceived risk and disapproval of occasional and regular marijuana use controlled for all student- and school-level measures (see Table 3). No significant relationships were observed for the general middle school student population. Among middle school student athletes, random athlete SDT was associated with significantly higher disapproval of using marijuana occasionally.\nY.M.

The current analyses found that any for- cause testing was associated with higher marijuana and OTM use\nTable 4\nSummary of significant multivariate associations (p < .05) between school drug testing and student illicit substance use and related measures\nand lower perceived risk/disapproval of marijuana use. Yet, among students attending schools with any for-cause testing, higher for-cause testing volume was associated with lower marijuana use and higher disapproval. For-cause testing is based on appearance or behavior indicative of substance use. School- level substance use has been shown to relate to the likelihood a student will personally engage in substance use [16e18]; students attending schools with for-cause SDT may be at higher risk of substance use due to a priori higher school use. The inverse testing volume-marijuana use relationship, however, indicates that once potential a priori higher use rates are accounted for by limiting the sample to only those schools with for-cause testing, a negative association between SDT volume and marijuana usedbut not OTM usedwas observed. Throughout the models, the desired association of lower drug use with SDT seemed to occur primarily with marijuana use under the conditions of any random testing in the general student population or in specific sub-populations subject to testing. The intent of SDT as a deterrent to OTM use appears not to be supported. Indeed, these results suggest that SDT may be associated with increased OTM use.\nLittle prior research examined differences in SDT-drug use associations across illicit substances. Of the significant literature contributions previously noted [1,6e11], only one study exam- ined associations separately for marijuana and other illicit drugs [10,11]. That study (which also utilized MTF data, but only for 1998e2002), found no significant results but did observe suggestive evidence of a decline in marijuana use coupled with a possible increase in OTM use. Those early findings were repli- cated in the current study and found to be significant with inclusion of 14 years of data. Literature on SDT efficacy generally indicates little association with illicit drug use among the general population [1,6e7,9] with some evidence for targeted student populations (7e9) for marijuana alone or in combination with other illicit drugs. In the current study, the higher predicted probabilities of OTM use associated with having various types of SDT were modestdranging from 1 to 2 percentage points across high school SDT types and population groups, compared with a modest 3 to 4 percentage point reduction in high school marijuana use. If marijuana and OTM were combined into one measure of illicit drug use, models would likely show little significance given the opposing nature of the associations.\nPossible mechanisms underlying the observed differences in SDT associations with marijuana and OTM include the following: (1) students may know that marijuana metabolites remain in the body for a longer time than metabolites of most other drugs, making other drugs less likely to be detected even if included in testing; and/or (2) students may move toward the use of illicit drugs not included in testing. Information on drug test detection times is readily available on the Internet [19e21]; as early as 1990, research indicated that drug-tested college athletes were significantly more knowledgeable than nontested college athletes about SDT detection-avoidance techniques including timing drug use so as to have substances clear their bodies prior to testing [22]. While middle and high school students are not likely to be as sophisticated as college students, it is likely they are aware of detection-avoidance techniques and likely to make use of informal communication networks to convey testing date estimates [22]. One experimental evaluation found that SDT significantly associated with high school student use of substances specifically tested for with no associations for overall substance use [7].\n  1.

Reductions in marijuana use among U.S. students are a highly desirable goal and may be associated with SDT; however, corresponding possible increases in OTM use raise serious concerns. Consider- able financial costs are also associated with conducting SDT, a particularly salient problem in times of economic stress.\nRandom SDT among the general high school student pop- ulation, as well as middle and high school subgroups targeted for testing, was associated with moderately lower marijuana use; however, most forms of testing were associated with moderately higher use of other illicit drugs, particularly in high school. These findings raise the question of whether SDT is worth this apparent tradeoff. Until further research can clarify the appar- ently opposing associations, schools should approach SDT with caution.\nStrengths and limitations\nStudy strengths include large national school and student samples and 14 years of observations, as well as specification of various types of testing, groups eligible for testing, and duration of random SDT implementation. Thirty-day use was chosen to ensure that outcomes occurred within the time period during which the current school year\xe2\x80\x99s drug testing program was operational. Past 12-month drug use outcomes were also examined; results were similar to those for past 30-day use.\nThere are several limitations. This is an observational study in which schools and school districts select themselves into testing or not testing, which may carry some selection bias. However, analyses controlled for a number of known correlates of drug use at both student and school levels, which should substantially reduce selection bias. Data were based neither on a pre-post design nor random assignment to treatment conditions; results do not prove causality. All data were based on self-report measures, but there is considerable evidence that MTF measures are likely largely reliable and valid [13]. Data on when students were subject to testing throughout the school year were not available; current analyses do not account for either the existence or level of implementation of educational drug prevention programming that may impact student substance use.\nAcknowledgments\nThe Monitoring the Future study is supported by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (DA01411), and the Youth, Education, and Society (YES) project is part of a larger research initiative funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, titled Bridging the Gap: Research Informing Policy and Practice for Healthy Youth Behavior.

Few studies have examined factors contributing to initiation into prescription drug mis- use, including sexual orientation and childhood abuse and neglect. The purpose of the present study is to investigate the relationship between initiation into the misuse of prescription drugs (opioids, tranquilizers, and stimulants), sexual identity, and individual and family determinants.\nMethod: Results are based upon data from a cross-sectional survey of 596 youth (polydrug users, homeless youth, and injection drug users) aged 16 to 25 who reported current prescription drug misuse. Participants were recruited in Los Angeles and New York City between 2009 and 2011. We compared initiation behaviors between sexual minority and heterosexual youth and examined factors modifying the relationship between sexual identity and earlier initiation into prescription drug misuse.\nResults: Sexual minority youth were more likely to report histories of initiation into misuse of prescription opioids and tranquilizers. Further, they were more likely to report various types of childhood abuse than heterosexual youth. However, multivariate analyses indicated that age of first prescribed drug was the most significant factor associated with initiation into misuse of all three categories of prescription drugs.\nConclusions: The correlates of initiation into prescription drug misuse are multidimensional and offer opportuni- ties for further research. Identifying additional factors contributing to initiation into prescription drug misuse is essential towards developing interventions that may reduce future drug use among young adults.\nAddictive Behaviors 37 (2012) 1289\xe2\x80\x931293\n    Contents lists available at SciVerse ScienceDirect Addictive Behaviors\n Short Communication\nInitiation into prescription drug misuse: Differences between lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBT) and heterosexual high-risk young adults in Los Angeles and New York\nAleksandar Kecojevic a,\xe2\x81\x8e, Carolyn F.

This is con- cerning given recent evidence indicating differences in prescription drug misuse between LGBT and heterosexual youth, particularly during adolescence (Corliss et al., 2010).\nSecond only to cannabis, prescription drugs are the most commonly used substances at drug initiation (Substance Abuse and Mental Health\n\xe2\x81\x8e Corresponding author.

While research is limited on initiation into prescription drug misuse, socio-demographic variables, such as race (Kosterman, Hawkins, Guo, Catalano, & Abbott, 2000), gender (Kandel & Logan, 1984) and sexual identity (Corliss, Rosario, Wypij, Fisher, & Austin, 2008), and family-related variables, such as single- parent households (Hemovich, Lac, & Crano, 2011), lack of parental monitoring (Bousman et al., 2005), and family substance abuse (Kumpfer, Olds, Alexander, Zucker, & Gary, 1998), have been identified as important factors associated with initiation into tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drug use. While these factors are also expected to impact prescrip- tion drug misuse among LGBT youth, additional factors such as adverse childhood experiences may predispose them to misuse of prescription drugs. LGBT youth have been found to experience significantly higher rates of childhood abuse compared to heterosexual youth (Friedman et al., 2011). These experiences have in turn been associated with neg- ative outcomes for LGBTs including mental health problems (Huebner, Rebchook, & Kegeles, 2004), increased HIV risk-taking behaviors\nrates of substance use\n \n1290 A. Kecojevic et al. / Addictive Behaviors 37 (2012) 1289\xe2\x80\x931293\n(Brennan, Hellerstedt, Ross, & Welles, 2007), and increased substance abuse (Kalichman et al., 2001). Initiation into use of licit and illicit drugs may reflect attempts to cope with stress and trauma from mal- treatment, as growing evidence points to the association between emo- tional, physical and sexual abuse and initiation of tobacco, alcohol and illicit drug use among adolescents and young adults (Ompad et al., 2005; Roy et al., 2003; Savin-Williams, 1994). Experiences of childhood abuse may thus play an important role in LGBT youths' initiation into prescription drug misuse.\nIn this study, we first compared prescription drug misuse initia- tion between a self-identified group of LGBT youth and their hetero- sexual counterparts. Given previous findings that LGBT individuals initiate use of tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drugs earlier, we hypothe- sized that LGBT participants would also report earlier initiation of prescription drugs. Next, we examined the relationships between sexual identity, childhood experiences of abuse, and initiation into prescription drug misuse, while accounting for important socio- demographic and family/environmental risk factors. We hypothe- sized that sexual identity would moderate associations between childhood abuse and earlier initiation into prescription drug misuse, such that the negative effects of childhood abuse on initiation of pre- scription drug misuse would be more pronounced among LGBT youth compared to heterosexual youth.\n2. Methods\n2.1. Participants and procedures\nData come from a previously reported study (Lankenau et al., 2012) examining prescription drug misuse among a sample of 596 young adults in Los Angeles and New York City. Eligible participants were 16\xe2\x80\x9325 years old and had misused a prescription drug, i.e., opioid, tran- quilizer, or stimulant, or any combination, at least three times in the last 90 days. Institutional review boards at Drexel University, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, and the National Development and Research Insti- tutes, Inc. approved the study.\n2.2. Measures\n2.2.1. Demographic variables\nStudy participants self-reported a variety of demographic infor- mation including race/ethnicity (coded as 0=\xe2\x80\x9cWhite\xe2\x80\x9d or 1=\xe2\x80\x9cnon- White minorities\xe2\x80\x9d) and gender at birth (0=male, 1=female). We also assessed homelessness before age 16 (0=no, 1=yes), socio- economic status (SES) growing up (0=\xe2\x80\x9cmiddle/upper class\xe2\x80\x9d, 1=\xe2\x80\x9cpoor/ working class\xe2\x80\x9d) and sexual orientation (dichotomized into 0 = heterosex- ual and 1=LGB(T)). Eight transgendered participants, although self- reporting straight sexual identity, were also classified as LGBT.\n2.2.2. Prescription drug misuse variables\nPrescription drug misuse was defined as taking prescription drugs \xe2\x80\x9cwhen they were not prescribed for you or that you took only for the ex- perience or feeling it caused\xe2\x80\x9d (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2010). The primary outcome was age of initia- tion for each type of prescription drug. Variables describing prescription drug misuse history, including being prescribed prescription pills, age of first prescription, access to, and source of prescription drugs, were ex- amined as covariates in the multivariate models. We approximated ac- cess by asking how much access participants had to their own prescriptions and to prescriptions belonging to members of their house- hold. \xe2\x80\x9cNo access\xe2\x80\x9d (0) was defined by responses characterizing the drugs being in a locked or unknown location; \xe2\x80\x9chaving access\xe2\x80\x9d (1) was defined by responses characterizing the drugs being located in unlocked or open places. Sources of participants' first misused prescription drugs were di- chotomized as participants' own prescription/prescription within the household (1), or as outside sources (0).\n2.2.3. Childhood abuse history\nQuestions defining emotional, physical, and sexual abuse were adopted from the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) (Bernstein et al., 1994). Fifteen items assessed abuse during childhood. Responses were scored on a Likert-type scale that ranged from 1 = \xe2\x80\x9cnever\xe2\x80\x9d to\n5 = \xe2\x80\x9cvery often\xe2\x80\x9d.\n(\xce\xb1 = 0.90, 0.90, 0.96 for the emotional, physical, and sexual subscales, respectively).\n2.3. Analyses\nWe first examined bivariate differences between LGBT and hetero- sexual youth on a range of variables related to initiation into prescrip- tion drug misuse. An alpha level of 0.05 was used to determine significance for all tests. Due to the large number of comparisons, all p-values have been adjusted using the false discovery rate controlling procedure (Benjamini & Hochberg, 1995).\nKey covariates for inclusion in models predicting ages of initiation for all three prescription drugs types were determined in bivariate analyses, and were retained for inclusion in regression models if pb0.05. Next, a series of multiple linear regression models with for- ward entry were used in which the first block of variables included socio-demographic characteristics. The second block included pre- scription drug history, access, and source variables. The final two blocks included childhood abuse variables and their interactions with sexual orientation. All independent continuous variables were mean-centered (Kraemer & Blasey, 2004). Analyses were performed using SPSS (version 18.0).\n3. Results\n3.1. Descriptive findings\nParticipants' demographics, initiation to prescription drug misuse, and severity of childhood abuse are presented in Table 1. The study rec- ruited 596 young adults; two participants refused to answer and were excluded from analysis, resulting in a final sample of 594: 201 (34%) self-identified as LGBT and 393 (66%) as heterosexual. Statistically sig- nificant differences between LGBT and heterosexual youth were found regarding race, gender, age of initiation into opioids and tranquilizers misuse, being prescribed tranquilizers, family members being pre- scribed opioids and tranquilizers, access to their own and family's tran- quilizers, and household as a source of first misused opioid and tranquilizer. Finally, high rates of abusive experiences in childhood were reported, with LGBT participants reporting substantially higher scores on all three scales of childhood abuse.\n3.2. Regression findings\nAfter controlling for socio-demographic and childhood abuse fac- tors, sexual identity was no longer associated with initiation into opi- oid, tranquilizer, or stimulant misuse. Age of first prescription was the strongest predictor of earlier misuse (opioids: \xce\xb2 = 0.34, 95% CI [0.27, 0.41], p b 0.001; tranquilizers: \xce\xb2 = 0.37, 95% CI [0.27, 0.47], p b 0.001; and stimulants: \xce\xb2 = 0.21, 95% CI [0.12, 0.29], p b 0.001). Further, par- ticipants with unmonitored access to tranquilizers were more likely to start misusing these tranquilizers (\xce\xb2 = \xe2\x88\x92 0.90, 95% CI [\xe2\x88\x92 1.81, 0.01], p b 0.05), and having household as the source of first misused stimulant predicted earlier stimulant initiation (\xce\xb2 = \xe2\x88\x92 2.16, 95% CI [\xe2\x88\x92 2.94, \xe2\x88\x92 1.37], p b 0.001). Experiencing sexual abuse was signifi- cantly associated with earlier tranquilizer initiation (\xce\xb2 = \xe2\x88\x92 0.11, 95% CI [\xe2\x88\x92 0.22, \xe2\x88\x92 0.003], p b 0.05) and nearly associated with earlier stim- ulant initiation (\xce\xb2 = \xe2\x88\x92 0.11, 95% CI [\xe2\x88\x92 0.22, 0.001], p = 0.05). Having experienced physical abuse was also nearly associated (\xce\xb2 = \xe2\x88\x92 0.11, 95% CI [\xe2\x88\x92 0.22, 0.001], p = 0.05) with earlier stimulant initiation.\nCronbach's alpha for the overall scale was 0.94\nNote: ns=non-significant.\na\nBecause we were interested in whether sexual identity modifies the effects of childhood abuse on prescription drug misuse initiation, we tested interactions between sexual identity and variables related to child- hood abuse. In the tranquilizer initiation model, the emotional abuse and sexual identity interaction was significant (\xce\xb2 = \xe2\x88\x92 0.19, 95% CI [\xe2\x88\x92 0.36, \xe2\x88\x92 0.03], p b 0.05), and the interaction between sexual abuse and sexual identity was nearly significant (\xce\xb2 = 0.12, 95% CI [\xe2\x88\x92 0.02, 0.26], p b 0.1), indicating that the effects of childhood abuse on tranquilizer initiation\nChi-square test based on male vs. female only. p b 0.05.\np b 0.01. \xe2\x81\x8e\xe2\x81\x8e\xe2\x81\x8e p b 0.001.\n\xe2\x81\x8e \xe2\x81\x8e\xe2\x81\x8e\nA.

While Fig. 1b indicates that over- all, LGBT youth initiated the use of tranquilizers at earlier ages, hetero- sexual youth who experienced high levels of sexual abuse appear to initiate the use of tranquilizers at a similar age as LGBT youth.\n4. Discussion and conclusions\nResults suggest that young adults who currently misuse prescription drugs initiated misuse during adolescence. As hypothesized, the results of this study revealed that LGBT youth start misusing prescription drugs at earlier ages than heterosexual youth, confirming previous findings (Corliss et al., 2010). LGBT identity was associated with earlier initiation of opioids and tranquilizers but not stimulants. However, the factors predicting initiation into prescription drug misuse are complex and multifaceted. Our findings confirm that drug availability is a powerful predictor of substance abuse among youth (Sung, Richter, Vaughan, Johnson, & Thom, 2005). In addition to their own prescriptions, the main source of prescription drug diversion for adolescents is within their households (McCabe, West, & Wechsler, 2007; Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2010).\nA major strength of this study is the assessment of childhood trau- ma, which addresses one of the most important stress factors in child- hood. Even after considering the effects of earlier prescribing and access to these drugs, childhood sexual abuse was a significant pre- dictor for earlier initiation into tranquilizer misuse, and sexual and physical abuse were nearly significant predictors of earlier initiation into stimulant misuse. This complements an earlier finding that survi- vors of sexual abuse exceeded the tranquilizer use of people reporting no sexual abuse by 70% (Zierler et al., 1991).\nOur study provides evidence that segments of the young adults exposed to various forms of childhood abuse are at risk for earlier ini- tiation into prescription drug misuse. Consistent with our hypothesis, LGBT youth who experienced emotional abuse in childhood were at significantly increased risk for earlier initiation into tranquilizers. This implies that effects of childhood emotional abuse on problematic drug behavior may be just as severe as physical or sexual abuse, in particular for the LGBT population. Although the interaction between sexual identity and sexual abuse was only marginally significant, it appears that LGBT youth initiated tranquilizers at a young age regard- less of any sexual abuse experiences. Moreover, heterosexual youth who reported higher sexual abuse initiated tranquilizers at earlier ages as well, suggesting a strong relationship between experiences of sexual abuse and younger age of tranquilizer initiation.\nDespite substantial increases in prescription drug misuse among adolescents and young adults in recent years, information on risk fac- tors contributing to initiation into prescription drug misuse is sparse. Prior research indicates that studying initiation events among young drug users contributes towards a fuller comprehension of emerging drug use trends (Lankenau & Clatts, 2004), user populations (Fuller et al., 2003), risk behaviors (Lankenau, Bloom, & Shin, 2010), and po- tential prevention and intervention strategies (Miller, Strathdee, Kerr, Li, & Wood, 2006). Our findings, which parallel those of other studies indicating that certain groups are at higher risk for prescription drug misuse (McCabe, Knight, Teter, & Wechsler, 2005; McCabe, Teter, Boyd, Knight, & Wechsler, 2005), help address this research gap.\nDespite study limitations, which include its cross-sectional design, inability to generalize to the larger population of young adults, and reliance on self-reported data, this study shows that LGBTs may initi- ate prescription drugs earlier than heterosexual youth. Thus, the timing of education programs for LGBT youth may need to be adjust- ed. We also found a link between childhood trauma experiences and the initiation of tranquilizers, with the effects of emotional abuse being particularly detrimental among LGBT youth. In addition to esta- blishing more stringent guideline to control prescribing practices of prescription drugs, prevention efforts should focus on curtailing the\nconsequences of early stressful life experiences that may be related to sexual minority status.\nRole of funding sources\nThis research was supported by funding from the National Institute of Drug Use (DA021299).

The present study aims to estimate the comorbidity of school bullying (perpetration and victimisation) with drug use by incorporating and meta-analysing all available ev- idence on the cross-sectional association between the two variables. Meta-analytic results are based on a compre- hensive systematic review across 20 databases and 46 journals. A total of 61 relevant manuscripts were included in the systematic review. Following explicit methodological criteria for the inclusion/exclusion of reports, 13 of them were eligible for the meta-analysis. The association of school bullying perpetration with drug use (adjusted odds ratio OR = 2.82; 95% CI 1.97\xe2\x80\x934.02; z = 5.71; p b .001) suggests a very strong relationship. For example, if a quarter of children were bullies and a quarter were drug users, this value of the OR would correspond to 40.88% of bullies being also drug users, compared with 19.71% of non-bullies. The association of school bullying victimisation with drug use (adjusted odds ratio OR = 1.79; 95% CI 1.38\xe2\x80\x932.32; z = 4.41; p b .001) suggests a mod- erate relationship. For example, if a quarter of children were victims and a quarter were drug users, this value of the OR would correspond to 33.69% of bullied youth also being drug users, compared with 22.1% of non-bullied youth. Adjusted effect sizes are based on study findings that used statistical controls for confounding variables, thus provid- ing the unique association of school bullying with drug use over and above other important risk factors that may ex- plain this association. Implications for policy and intervention research arising from this review are highlighted.\n\xc2\xa9 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction\nBullying is one of the most prevalent forms of aggression in school (Nansel et al., 2001). It includes a range of direct (e.g., physical damage, injurious words, threats) and indirect behaviours (e.g., rumours or re- jection of victims) characterised by being intentional, repeated over time and performed in a context of power imbalance (CDC, 2014). Al- though the prevalence varies among countries and cultures, a general trend seems to indicate that between 20% and 30% of schoolchildren are involved in school bullying (Craig et al., 2009; Juvonen, Graham, & Schuster, 2003).\nBullying has been the focus of intervention efforts not only because of the problematic nature of the behaviour per se, but also because of its adverse effects on children's physical and psychosocial health (Fekkes, Pijpers, Fredriks, Vogels, & Verloove-Vanhorick, 2006; Gini & Pozzoli, 2009). Notably, longitudinal studies and meta-analyses suggest that bullies are more likely to develop symptoms of depression (e.g., Ttofi, Farrington, Lo\xcc\x88sel, & Loeber, 2011a) and to be involved in de- linquency (e.g., Ttofi, Farrington, Lo\xcc\x88sel, & Loeber, 2011b) as well as in vi- olence (e.g., Ttofi, Farrington, & Lo\xcc\x88sel, 2012).\nFurthermore, the cross-sectional evidence suggests that bullying can be correlated and co-occur along with other hazardous behaviours which can seriously interfere with the psychosocial development of chil- dren (Farrington, 1993, 2005; Loeber, Farrington, Stouthamer-Loeber, & Van Kammen, 1998). This includes, for instance, low self-esteem, depression, anxiety, delinquency, weapon carrying and drug use (Bradshaw, Waasdorp, Goldweber, & Johnson, 2013; Pranjic & Bajraktarevic, 2010; Ttofi & Farrington, 2008).\nThis paper examines the link between school bullying and drug use. Both are prevalent problem behaviours during the school years and both of them are correlated with a broad array of negative developmen- tal outcomes (Luk, Wang, & Simons-Morton, 2012), highlighting the need for intervening early and addressing both of these risk factors which may function as a stepping stone towards other problem behav- iours in adult life (Ttofi et al., 2012). Both factors, for instance, impact negatively the academic development (Beran, Hughes, & Lupart, 2008; Schwartz, 2000) and general mental health (Birkett, Espelage, & Koenig, 2009; Fleming & Jacobsen, 2009b; Roland, 2002; Waters, Wake, Toumbourou, Wright, & Salmon, 1999; Wei, Williams, Chen, & Chang, 2010) of children.\nDespite a growing body of cross-sectional research on the link be- tween drug use and bullying behaviour during school years (Brown, Riley, Butchart, & Kann, 2008; Moon & Alarid, 2014; Niemela\xcc\x88 et al., 2011), no previous meta-analysis has been conducted to systematically synthesize relevant evidence and to identify the magnitude and the di- rection of this association. The current paper addresses this gap by meta-analysing results from existing published and unpublished stud- ies following a comprehensive systematic review. This meta-analytic in- vestigation has obvious implications for intervention research. To the extent that a significant association between school bullying and drug use can be established, then it may be inferred that effective bullying prevention programmes could be viewed as an effective intervention strategy for the reduction of school bullying and other co-occurring problem behaviours, including drug use.\n1.1. Bullying and drug use: theoretical perspectives\nIt is difficult to determine the exact prevalence of bullying involve- ment and drug use as a comorbid phenomenon, due to varying sam- pling and other methodological features across available studies. Luk et al. (2012) found that 5.4% of adolescents [Mage = 14.2; SD = 1.42] displayed a co-morbid condition, while Radliff, Wheaton, Robinson, and Morris (2012) found co-morbidity for 4.9% of high school students and for 1.6% of middle schoolchildren. In a sample of adolescents [Mage = 15.3; SD = 1.58], Garcia Continente, Pe\xcc\x81rez Gime\xcc\x81nez, and\nNebot Adell (2010) found that 7% of boys and 9.6% of girls displayed a co-morbid condition.\nPrevalence rates of drug use also vary between school students who are involved in different bullying roles as perpetrators, victims or bully- victims. Evidence suggests that perpetrators are overrepresented in drug consumption categories compared with non-bullies (Kaltiala- Heino, Rimpela\xcc\x88, Rantanen, & Rimpela\xcc\x88, 2000). Victims are also more like- ly to use drugs compared to non-involved individuals; however, preva- lence rates are higher for perpetrators than victims of school bullying. For instance, Radliff et al. (2012) concluded that 11.4% of bullies report- ed marijuana use, compared with only 2% of victims and 1% of non- involved children. Comparable evidence is available from another American survey (Bradshaw et al., 2013), asserting that bullies are two times more likely to use drugs (OR = 2.77; 95% CI 2.4\xe2\x80\x933.2; p b .001) compared with non-involved students, while the association for victims is much weaker (OR = 1.30; 95% CI 1.1\xe2\x80\x931.5 p b .001).\nA more restricted body of research has collected information for a special group of victims who also display aggressive behaviours, known as bully-victims. The link between drug use and aggressive vic- tims is less conclusive in the literature. While Kaltiala-Heino et al. (2000) and Bradshaw et al. (2013) suggest a high association between those acting as bully-victims and drug use (with OR = 7.1; 95% CI 4.1\xe2\x80\x93 12.2 and OR = 3.4; 95% CI 3.1\xe2\x80\x934.4; p b .001 accordingly), the conclusion of Niemela\xcc\x88 et al. (2011) does not support such findings (OR = 0.3; 95% CI .04\xe2\x80\x932.6; p b .05).\nThe literature offers various theoretical explanations for the link between school bullying and drug use. A notable body of research argues that drug use may function as a coping mechanism against the experience of stressful life events, including school bullying and peer victimisation. Coping theory proposes that adolescents engage in high risk behaviours in response to increased negative af- fects resulting from exposure to victimisation (Lazarus, 1993). Since bullying is characterised by repeated aggressive acts over time against less powerful (physically or emotionally) individuals, it is plausible that victims of school bullying may engage in sub- stance use as a (maladaptive) way of coping with their negative school experiences.\nA similar theoretical framework is that of Agnew's (1992) general strain theory of crime and deviance, which has been used in school bul- lying research to explain the higher prevalence of self-harm exhibited by victims as compared to non-victimised students (Hay & Meldrum, 2010). Both coping theory and general strain theory could explain the higher prevalence of substance use among school bullies. Specifically, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of 153 studies (Cook, Williams, Guerra, Kim, & Sadek, 2010:75) concluded that bullies tend to present negative self-related cognitions, come from a conflictive fam- ily environment characterised by poor parental monitoring, and are more likely to perceive the school as having a negative atmosphere. In that context, it may be argued that the \xe2\x80\x98typical bully\xe2\x80\x99 is more likely to be involved in drug use as a way to cope with stressful life experiences within the family and school.\nAnother theoretical model suggests that substance use functions as a trigger for subsequent aggression and violence due to physiological changes (Yudko, Blanchard, Henrie, & Blanchard, 1997) or due to the in- volvement of drug users with deviant/delinquent groups (Bui, Ellickson, & Bell, 2000). In particular, Goldstein (1985) argued in favour of a causal link of drug use on crime based on three mechanisms: (1) drug users become more irrational which can trigger off violent behaviours (psy- chopharmacological explanation), (2) drug users can be compelled to commit crime in order to finance their consumption (economic expla- nation), and (3) violent behaviours in drug users are the result of their participation in the illegal drug market (systemic explanation). While any argument about a causal link between bullying and drug use can only be supported by better quality methodological criteria such as by evidence from within-individual analyses and longitudinal research (Murray, Farrington, & Eisner, 2009), the focus of the current paper is\nto synthesize all available cross-sectional evidence and establish the prevalence rates of drug use among school bullies and victims com- pared with non-involved students.\nSome of the above theoretical frameworks could be transferred to the school setting in order to explain the co-occurrence of drug use and bullying behaviour. Goldstein's economically compulsive frame- work could explain networks supporting drug distribution within schools, while the systemic framework is in line with existing research on the deviant lifestyle of both drug users and school bullies. Copying theory may be a plausible framework explaining why bullies and their victims may engage in drug use to begin with, although alternative the- oretical models could shed light on other aspects of this phenomenon (e.g. differential association theory, explaining how children learn prob- lem behaviour from associations with delinquent peers).\nAll in all, children involved in school bullying as perpetrators or vic- tims are children in need. Irrespective of whether children do drugs in order to cope with stressful life events or simply because of their antiso- cial lifestyle, research efforts should be invested in understanding the extant magnitude of this phenomenon. This paper aims to address this by synthesizing all available scientific evidence arising from cross- sectional studies.\n1.2. The current review\nThis paper aims to produce a standardised effect size on the associ- ation between bullying and drug use based on a thorough systematic review and meta-analysis. Two summary effect sizes will be reported: one on the association of bullying perpetration with drug use; and one on the association of bullying victimisation with drug use. To the best of our knowledge, there are no previous meta-analyses based on cross-sectional studies intending to summarise findings on the drug- bullying link.\nThe study is guided by the following research questions:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 What is the size and direction of the association between school bul- lying and drug use?\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Are victims of school bullying more likely to score highly on drug use when compared with non-involved children?\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Areperpetratorsofschoolbullyingmorelikelytoscorehighlyondrug use when compared with non-involved children?\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Is the bullying-drug link stronger for perpetrators or victims?\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Aretheregender-specificeffects?Inotherwords,doesbullyinghavea\nstronger impact on boys than girls?\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Are there ethnic-specific effects?\n2. Methods\n2.1. Search strategies\nIn order to identify all possibly relevant studies and control for publication bias, an extensive search was carried out. We explored 20 databases, including searches on manuscripts produced in Latin American and other Spanish-speaking countries. In an attempt to target the grey literature (Wilson, 2009), our searches cover also databases specific to unpublished graduate theses (e.g., Ethos- Electronic Theses Online Service). We also conducted hand searches in all volumes of 46 journals. Bibliographies from earlier narrative re- views were also checked.\n2.2. Criteria for inclusion or exclusion of reports\nStudies included in the meta-analysis met the following criteria:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 We targeted manuscripts measuring school bullying rather than other general forms of aggression. Papers on bullying within other settings, such as bullying at work, or other manifestations of victimisation or\nviolence (e.g., fights, school shouting) outside or inside the school\nwere excluded (Lambert, Scourfield, Smalley, & Jones, 2008).\n\xe2\x80\xa2 In terms of the time frame, databases and journals were searched\nfrom inception to the end of 2014.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Included studies provided a statistical measure of the association be-\ntween bullying (victimisation and/or perpetration) and drug use. For this meta-analysis, drug use refers to hard drugs, for instance cocaine and/or inhalants (e.g., Kaltiala-Heino et al., 2000), or softer drugs such as marijuana/cannabis (e.g., Liang, Flisher, & Lombard, 2007). Studies reporting on combined measures of alcohol or cigarette use plus drugs (e.g., Carlyle & Steinman, 2007) were excluded. Similarly, studies reporting on other unspecified substances were excluded (i.e., Gruber & Fineran, 2007).\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Included studies sampled children and adolescents from mainstream schools so that results are generalisable to the wider school popula- tion. Studies reporting measures for adults (e.g., Bebbington et al., 2004) or psychiatric inpatients (e.g., Luukkonen, 2010) were exclud- ed.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 As cross-sectional studies are particularly suitable for estimating the prevalence of behaviours (Levin, 2006; Sedgwick, 2014), the present study focused only on cross-sectional research, including reports with adjusted measures of the targeted association. When the report provided adjusted and unadjusted data, we only used adjusted results for the meta-analysis.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Sources included were book chapters (e.g., Pepler, Craig, Connolly, & Henderson, 2002) journal articles, and academic MSc and PhD theses (e.g., Edwards, 2002).\nAppendix Table A presents the studies that were excluded from the meta-analysis as well as justifications on why this decision was reached.\n2.3. Combining effect sizes within a report relating to the same outcome measure\nIn some cases reports presented more than one effect size that could be coded. For instance, some reports presented the same outcome for different groups of respondents (subgroups within the study), namely boys and girls (e.g., Pepler et al., 2002), or middle and high school stu- dents (e.g., Radliff et al., 2012) or respondents from different ethnic groups (e.g., Fernando, 2009). In these cases, the results were combined in a single summary effect size for each study under investigation.\nAdditionally, some studies reported separate results for pupils who were bully-victims. Since the number of studies was limited (four stud- ies), we did not meta-analyse results for this category (e.g., comparing bully-victims and non-involved children). However, following the criteria used in previous studies (e.g., Ttofi et al., 2012) bully-victims were added (combined) to both bullies and victims categories so that the increase in the prevalence of each category was proportionate.\n3. Results\n3.1. Systematic review\nInitial online searches resulted in hundreds of hits, but only 61 re- ports were relevant to the aims of our systematic review, namely reports with relevant data on both school bullying (perpetration and/or victimisation) and drug use. Upon further screening of the full text of these reports, it was established that the majority were not be included in the meta-analyses, because they did not provide an adjusted effect size on the association of drug use with either school bullying (perpetration and/ or). The meta-analyses included studies that investigated the rela- tionship between school bullying (perpetration and/or victimisation) and drug use after controlling for other childhood risk factors (e.g. child, parental, child-rearing, peer, school, socio-economic and neighbourhood variables) that are significantly correlated with school\nS.

Valdebenito et al. / Aggression and Violent Behavior 23 (2015) 137\xe2\x80\x93146\nTable 1\nCharacteristics of studies included in the systematic review.a Systematic review\nsystematic review, only one was based on multi-informant measures. In terms of the role played by schoolchildren in bullying, most of the studies encompassed measures for victims (46%) or bullies (15%) only. Thirty nine per cent of the studies measured more than two roles (e.g., bullies, victims and/or bully-victims).\nTable 2 reports all manuscripts included in the meta-analyses and relevant effect sizes for each report. Not all studies provided both mea- sures of association (bullying perpetration with drug use and bullying victimisation with drug use). Table 2 also presents covariates that were used in statistical controls across studies in order to provide the adjusted and un-confounded effect size on the drug-bullying associa- tion. The variability in statistical controls used across studies is evident, with some studies controlling for basic demographic measures (e.g. Brown et al., 2008) while other studies controlling for a notable number of childhood variables from the individual, family and school domain (e.g. Romera et al., 2011). This could explain the notable variability in ef- fect sizes across individual studies (see below).\n3.2. Meta-analysis\nA total of 13 studies provided enough statistical information to cal- culate an effect size on the prevalent association between bullying (per- petration and/or victimisation) and drug use. They represented a total of 152,326 cases.\n3.2.1. The association between bullying perpetration at school and drug use\nFig. 1 illustrates that only eight eligible studies reported effect sizes on the association of bullying perpetration and drug use. Individual ef- fect sizes for each study are available in the forest plot, with most sug- gesting a positive association between bullying perpetration and drug use. For them, the adjusted summary effect size (under a random model) was OR = 2.817 (95% CI 1.974\xe2\x80\x934.020; z = 5.709; p b .001). One study (Kaltiala-Heino et al., 2000) provided a notably larger indi- vidual effect size, despite the eligibility of the study based on the inclu- sion criteria. Removal of this study marginally changed the summary effect size to an OR of 2.4 (95% CI: 1.7\xe2\x80\x933.5) hence the decision was made to keep this study in the final analyses. The final summary effect size of OR = 2.8 indicates a very strong relationship between bullying perpetration and drug use. For example, if a quarter of children were bullies and a quarter were drug users, this value of the OR would corre- spond to 40.88% of bullies becoming drug users, compared with 19.71% of non-bullies.\nGiven the heterogeneity in methodological features (e.g., location and sample size) of the studies included, heterogeneity tests were con- ducted. Cochran's test, Q, was significant at p b .001 level (Q = 514.60; I2 = 99), supporting the presence of high dispersion in effect size across studies. As already mentioned, this was expected given the variability in statistical controls used across studies.\n3.2.2. Bullying perpetration at school and drug use: publication bias analysis\nWe ran analyses for publication bias given the small number of studies included in this meta-analysis. Duval and Tweedie's trim- and-fill analysis exhibits the differences in effect sizes that could po- tentially be attributed to bias; the technique imputes effect sizes until the error distribution gets close to normality. In this way, the test offers the best estimate of the unbiassed effect (Borenstein, Hedges, Higgins, & Rothstein, 2009). Results suggest that there were no differences in effect sizes attributable to bias. Under a fixed effect model, the point estimate for the combined studies did not differ when comparing the original and the adjusted estimate (in both cases it was OR = 2.94; 95% CI 2.86\xe2\x80\x933.03). Correspondingly, under the random effect model, the values again did not vary (in both cases they were OR = 2.82; 95% CI 1.97\xe2\x80\x934.02). Based on the parameter of Duval and Tweedie's trim-and-fill, it seems that no studies are missing.\n Meta-analysis\nNumber % of studies\n13 100%\n\xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x93\n2 16% 11 84%\nEurope\nNorth America\nAsia 12%\xe2\x80\x93\xe2\x80\x93\n   Total Included Excluded\nAge of the participants\nLess than 12 years old and more than 18 years old\nBetween 12 and 18 years old\nLocation of the sample studied\nNumber % of studies\n61 100% 22 36% 39 64%\nLatin America\nMore than 1 low-income\ncountry (comparative) Africa\nAustralia and New Zealand\nType of publication\nJournal\nBook\nReports (governmental) Academic Thesis\nLanguage\nEnglish Spanish Italian Lithuanian Portuguese\nType of measure\nSelf-report\nLife-story\nInterview\nMore than 1 measure\nRole in bullying\nVictims\nBullies (perpetrators)\nBullies (perpetrators) + victims More than 2 roles measured Not measured\n8 13% 1 8% 3 5% 2 15%\n3 5% 2\n1 2% \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x93\n22 36% 23 37%\n3 23% 5 39%\n57 93% 10\n1 1 2\n54 4 1 1 1\n58 1 1 1\n26 7 12 14 2\n2% \xe2\x80\x93 2% \xe2\x80\x93\n\xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x93\n3% \xe2\x80\x93 in the meta-analysis.\n\xe2\x80\x93\n77% 2% 1 8%\n2% \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x93 3% 2 15%\n88% 12 92% 6% 1 8% 2% \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x93\n94% 13 100%\n2% \xe2\x80\x93\n2% \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x93 2% \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x93\n43% 6 46% 11% 2 15% 20% \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x93 23% 5 39%\n15%\n\xe2\x80\x93\n a A fraction of these studies are included\nbullying and drug use. In this way, relatively robust conclusions could be drawn about the extent to which school bullying may have an effect on the outcome measure over and above the contribution of other con- founding variables. Appendix Table A gives reasons for the exclusion of the majority of these studies from the meta-analyses.\nTable 1 provides further information about the 61 studies that were relevant for the aims of the systematic review. Most studies are based on samples from Europe and North America. Three studies (i.e., Brown et al., 2008; Rudatsikira, Muula, & Siziya, 2008; Siziya et al., 2013) exam- ined populations from low-income countries in Latin America or Africa. Seventy seven per cent of the studies were retrieved from peer- reviewed journal articles. Unpublished reports are a minority, as has been found in other recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses (e.g., Lo\xcc\x88sel & Beelmann, 2003, 2006; Ttofi et al., 2012).\nIn almost all studies, the samples involved both boys and girls, with the exception of three studies that only reported results for boys (i.e., McMahon, Reulbach, Keeley, Perry, & Arensman, 2010; Stein, Dukes, & Warren, 2007; Waters et al., 1999). However, few studies pro- vided results for boys and girls separately (e.g., Siziya et al., 2013). The same is applicable with variables such as ethnicity (e.g., Liang et al., 2007). In terms of age, the mean age ranged between 11 and 15 years.\nSelf-report questionnaires were the dominant tool to collect data in the screened reports. In fact, among the studies included in the\nTable 2\nAdjusted effect sizes for school bullying and drug use.a\nS.

In fact, it should be said that regression coefficients and correlation coefficients are quite similar, though their distribution is different. This assumption was also confirmed by Peterson and Brown (2005).\nAdditionally, Rosenthal's fail-safe N test is a technique for computing the number of missing studies that would be necessary to nullify the found effect. Small numbers of missing studies would reveal likelihood\nof biassed effects. Test was equal 777.3, suggesting that it would be nec- essary to allocate and include 777.3 missing studies with no effects for every observed one to achieve the combined 2-tailed p-value exceeding\n142 S. Valdebenito et al. / Aggression and Violent Behavior 23 (2015) 137\xe2\x80\x93146\n0.05. It therefore is highly unlikely that missing studies could alter the substantive conclusion.\n3.2.3. The association between school bullying victimisation and drug use\nEleven studies were concerned with the association between bul- lying victimisation and drug use. Individual effect sizes across stud- ies are shown in Fig. 2. The adjusted effect size for the association between bullying victimisation and drug use, after controlling for co- variates, was OR = 1.790 (95% CI 1.382\xe2\x80\x932.318; z = 4.409 p b .001). One study (Brown et al., 2008) provided a notably larger individual effect size, despite the eligibility of the study based on the inclusion criteria. Removal of this study marginally changed the summary ef- fect size to an OR of 1.5 (95% CI: 1.3\xe2\x80\x931.9) hence the decision was made to keep this study in the final analyses. A summary effect size of OR = 1.8 indicates a moderate relationship between bullying victimisation and drug use. For example, if a quarter of children were victims and a quarter were drug users, this value of the OR would correspond to 33.69% of bullied youth becoming drug users, compared with 22.1% of non-bullied youth. Cochran's Q suggests substantial variability in the estimates between studies (Cochran's Q = 220.682; p b .001; I2 = 95).\n3.2.4. Bullying victimisation at school and drug use: publication bias analysis\nAfter running Duval and Tweedie's trim-and-fill procedure, there were no differences in effect sizes attributable to bias resulting from systematically missing studies from the meta-analysis. Results re- vealed that under a fixed effect model, the point estimate for the combined studies did not vary when comparing the original and the adjusted estimated (in both cases it was OR = 1.78; 95% CI 1.72\xe2\x80\x931.83). Correspondingly, under a random effect model, the point estimate for the combined studies did not vary (in both cases it was OR = 1.78; 95% CI 1.38\xe2\x80\x932.31). In other words, Duval and Tweedie's trim-and-fill procedure shows that results cannot be invalidated because of publication bias.\nRosenthal's fail-safe N test was equal to 141.3, suggesting that it would be necessary to allocate and include 141.3 missing studies with no effects for every observed one to achieve the combined 2-tailed p- value exceeding .05. After a systematic review that involved a search on 20 databases from different countries and in different languages, it seems improbable that this huge number of studies could be available yet missed.\n4. Discussion\n4.1. Conclusions and implications for policy and practice\nThis meta-analysis provides support for the strong link between bullying at school and drug use. Specifically, bullies are roughly three times more likely to take drugs compared with non-involved children. Victims, on the other hand, are roughly twice as likely to take drugs compared with non-involved youth. Although the corre- lational nature of these cross-sectional studies precludes any causal inference, they are consistent with the notion that bullying is an im- portant childhood risk for the physical and mental health of students (Bradshaw et al., 2013; Brown et al., 2008). Notably, meta-analytic results are based on an adjusted effect size, indicating the association of school bullying with drug use over and above the impact of other major childhood risk factors, thus providing the independent bullying-drug link.\nMeta-analytic results are concordant with earlier research that chil- dren involved in school bullying as either perpetrators or victims are at increased risk for drug use (Sullivan, Farrell, & Kliewer, 2006). In fact, both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies suggest that bullying per- petration at school is a strong co-current correlate (Bradshaw et al., 2013) or predictor of future drug use (Farrington & Ttofi, 2011). Find- ings are also comparable with previous results in terms of the idea that perpetrators show more externalising problems than victims. For instance, previous meta-analyses showed that the perpetration of bully- ing was more predictive of violence and offending later in life than victimisation (Ttofi et al., 2011b, 2012). In any case, following our re- sults, the odds of victims for drug use are almost double those for non-involved. Although the explanations given for the drug-bullying victimisation association are not part of this research, it seems plausible that drugs aid victims in coping with the negative effects of rejection (Carlyle & Steinman, 2007).\nInterestingly, the magnitude of the effect sizes in the present meta-analysis is similar to earlier meta-analytic findings on the drug-crime link among adults (Bennett, Holloway, & Farrington, 2008). Although these results represent a different population, it is quite reasonable to hypothesise that externalising problem behav- iours such as bullying, criminal behaviour and drug use may be viewed as manifestations of the same underlying theoretical con- struct expressed differently across life (Farrington, 1997; Loeber et al., 1998; Ttofi et al., 2012).\nChildren involved in school bullying are children that could present other associated risks for their future development.

Forest plot for bullying victimisation and drug use (adjusted effect size): meta-analysis of cross-sectional studies.\ninvestigation, based on a thorough systematic review, supports that school bullies and their victims have a heightened risk of being involved in drug use. Therefore, intervention strategies aiming at tackling school bullying and promoting safer school communities should be promoted. It can be inferred that effective bullying prevention programmes could be seen as having a potentially positive effect in reducing associated problem behaviours such as drug use.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first meta-analytic investi- gation to establish a clear link between bullying and drug use. There is a higher prevalence rate of drug use among bullies and their victims compared with non-aggressive children. To an extent, this is expectable given that existing research supports the comorbidity of aggressive, vi- olent and other externalising problem behaviours (Loeber et al., 1998). An important question arising from this research is why such a link ex- ists. What are the mechanisms linking bullying perpetration and victimisation with drug use? This question cannot be addressed from the current study findings although it could be hypothesised that this is related to the marked shared variance in risk factors predicting these co-morbid behaviours (Bebbington et al., 2004; Brown et al., 2008; Farrington, 2002).\nChildhood bullying is a significant risk factor for adverse outcomes in adult life (Ttofi et al., 2011a, 2011b; Ttofi, Farrington, Lo\xcc\x88sel, & Loeber, 2011c; Ttofi et al., 2012) while substance use early in youth, combined with other childhood risks, is predictive of adult substance dependence (Sartor, Lynskey, Heath, Jacob, & True, 2006). Therefore, this meta- analysis highlights the importance of early intervention research in targeting school aggressive behaviour and associated externalising problems at root before they develop into more serious problems later in life. Current meta-analytic findings have important implications for policy and practice. They underline the need for school communities and relevant authorities to create a violence-free school environment and the need to devise and implement measures that promote the healthy psychosocial development of youth. More efforts should also be made to implement evidence-based policies and programmes with individual bullies and victims, perhaps based on child skills training (Lo\xcc\x88sel & Beelmann, 2003) and family-based programmes (Farrington & Welsh, 2003). Both bullying prevention programme and more general multi-component programmes may be equally beneficial for multi- problem children (Ttofi et al., 2012), reducing aggression among schoolchildren as well as other comorbid behaviours such as drug use. In fact, early intervention aimed at preventing or stopping school bullying should be understood as an early and cost-effective way to counteract risks and prevent antisocial behaviour, including drug use\n(Beelmann & Lo\xcc\x88sel, 2006; Farrington, 1993; Gottfredson, Wilson, & Najaka, 2002).\n4.2. Limitations and future research\nDespite the large number of studies indicating a link between bully- ing and drug use, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first quantita- tive synthesis of the existing research. The results of this meta-analytic investigation show that the primary studies included were mainly based national and international large-scale surveys that intended to cover many aspects of schoolchildren's health and psychosocial devel- opment. While the epidemiological nature of many of the primary stud- ies is a positive feature supporting the meta-analytic synthesis of homogeneous studies, it also comes with some methodological con- cerns. Specifically, many of the included studies were based on the Global School-based Student Health Survey (GSHS) or the Health Be- haviour in School-aged Children Survey (HBSC). Both surveys use only few items to measure school bullying, meaning that important aspects may not be adequately covered. Although bullying shares defining fea- tures with peer aggression and harassment, the distinctions among them point towards different legal remedies and policy repercussions (Cascardi, Brown, Iannarone, & Cardona, 2014), including practical methodological implications since broad definitions of school bullying could be responsible for overestimated prevalence rates (Cornell & Cole, 2012).\nOne of the initial aims of this meta-analysis was to report separate effect sizes for males and females as well as separate effect sizes for dif- ferent ethnic groups. However, only one study reported data for differ- ent ethnic groups and only two studies reported gender-specific effect sizes. These limitations were present in many other covariates, making it impossible to run analyses to explain the heterogeneity of our findings.\nIt would be ideal if future research drew safe conclusions about var- iability in effect sizes based on different moderators such as gender and ethnicity. Future research should also investigate the comorbidity of bullying and drug use in low-middle income countries, especially given the higher prevalence rates of bullying in these countries (Fleming & Jacobsen, 2009a; Muula, Herring, Siziya, & Rudatsikira, 2009).\nWe suggest that future research should pay more attention to bully- victims and investigate the actual rates of drug use among this specific group. Due to the fact that they tend to attack when victimised, they can also be targets of retaliation in a vicious circle of aggression\n144 S. Valdebenito et al. / Aggression and Violent Behavior 23 (2015) 137\xe2\x80\x93146\n(Nansel et al., 2001). Bully-victims are also more rejected than bullies or victims, experiencing frequent isolation and avoidance (Juvonen et al., 2003). Bearing in mind that it has been identified as the most at risk group (Schwartz, 2000), more research needs to be carried out into their characteristics and comorbid risks.\nFinally, future research should focus on the development of bet- ter instruments for measuring school bullying, including multi- informant measures (surveys) that may potentially achieve a more precise perspective on the phenomenon of school bullying (Crothers & Levinson, 2004). This will enable investigations into whether school bullies are more likely to use drugs compared with children who score high on general aggression instruments and potentially address whether this differentiation is really neces- sary (Finkelhor, Turner, & Hamby, 2012).\nDeclaration of interest\nNone of the authors have any financial interests related to findings reported in this review.\nAppendix Appendix Table A\nStudies excluded from the meta-analyses.\nDescription of exclusion criteria\n1 Alexander, Currie, and Mellor (2004). The exact Ns for female and male bullies are not given. All that is indicated is that 16.2% of female bullies used cannabis compared with 9% of female non-bullies; and 16.7% of male bullies used cannabis versus 12.7% of male non-bullies (see penultimate page of the report)\n2 Azevedo da Silva et al. (2012). Although the report offers information on the association of bullying victimisation and drug use, data is presented incomplete. They report means and standard deviations, and also percentages but sample size for subgroups are not reported (see p. 21\xe2\x80\x9322)\n3 Bebbington et al. (2004). The sample population consisted of school children (aged 16 onwards) and also adults up to age 74 (p. 220)\n4 Birkett et al. (2009). Data on drug use is included in a general report of alcohol consumption (p. 993). Fig. 4 (p. 996) doesn't offer enough statistical information.\n5 Brunner et al. (2007). Bullying and illicit drug use are both included as predictors for self-harm (Table 1 p. 644) but statistical data on the association between bullying and drug use is not provided in this report (p. 632\xe2\x80\x93646).\n6 Carmona-Torres, Cangas, Garci\xcc\x81a, Langer, and Za\xcc\x81rate (2012) The study compares a paper-based and computer-based questionnaire that aims to measure bullying and drug use. Psychometric properties of the two instruments and results from factor analyses are shown (p. 44). The paper does not report the association between bullying and drug use (see Table 2 and 3 in p. 45\xe2\x80\x9346).\n7 Carlyle and Steinman (2007). The concept substance use involves alcohol and cigarettes (p. 625)\n8 Cruzeiro and Azevedo da Silva (2008). Bullying and drug use are used as predictors for conduct problems (relevant OR given in Table 1, p. 2015) but the association between both variables is not reported.\n9 Cuevas, Finkelhor, Turner, and Ormrod (2007). The outcome measure includes alcohol and drug combined (Table 2 and 3 p. 1591 and 1592)\n10 Cullen, Unnever, Hartman, Turner, and Agnew (2008). Statistical information on bullying victimisation versus drug use is presented on Table 2 (p. 355) but the outcome measure included both drug use and alcohol use (see\np. 353)\n11 Duffecy, Bleil, Labott, Browne, and Galvani (2008). Data on bullying and drug use are presented in Table 2 (p. 624) but statistical information on the association between bullying and drug use is not provided in this report.\n12 Gruber and Fineran (2007). The study presents data on the association of bullying with substance abuse (Table 3, p. 637) but it is not clear whether substance abuse includes only drugs. On p. 633 the authors refer to the questionnaire they used to measure substance abuse by Hanisch and Hulin (1991) but the paper makes no mention of drug use at all. Additionally it is not helpful in clarifying what involves \xe2\x80\x98substance abuse\xe2\x80\x99.\n13 Gruber and Fineran (2008). The study presents data on the association of bullying and substance abuse (Table 3, p. 9), which involves alcohol and drug use combined (p. 6).\nAppendix Table A (continued)\nDescription of exclusion criteria\n14 Hinduja and Patchin (2008). It refers to cyber bullying (p. 138) and also the consumption of drugs measure is combined with liquor use (p. 140).\n15 Jablonska and Lindberg (2007). Although drug use is measured (p. 657), the study did not regard the association between bullying and drug use. OR on drug use is given for adolescents who had different family structures (p. 659).\n16 Kaltiala-Heino, Marttunen, Rantanen, and Rimpela\xcc\x88 (2003). Data on bullying perpetration and substance use are presented on Table 3 (p. 1060) but the statistical information on their association is not presented.\n17 Konu and Lintonen (2006). The outcome drug use is not measured.\n18 Konu, Lintonen, and Rimpela\xcc\x88 (2002). Although drug use is measured (Table 1,\np. 159), the study doesn't present statistical results regarding the association\nbetween bullying and drug use.\n19 Lambert et al. (2008). Bullying victimisation was measured along with \xe2\x80\x98being\nbadly treated\xe2\x80\x99; and the equivalent for bullying perpetration (see p. 272). 20 Luk, Wang, and Simons-Morton (2010) Substance use includes alcohol and\ndrugs (p. 356).\n21 Luk et al. (2012). Although marijuana use is measured (p. 1354), the results\nrefer to \xe2\x80\x98substance-using bullies\xe2\x80\x99. The category of substance use, combine\nalcohol and marijuana (Fig. 1 and Table 3, p. 1356).\n22 Martinelli et al. (2011). Data on bullying and cannabis use are presented in\nTable 1 (p. 341) but statistical information on the association between them is not provided. The authors present results only for significant variables and results on cannabis use are not indicated because they were non significant (p. 341).\n23 McMahon, Reulbach, Corcoran, et al. (2010). Bullying perpetration and drug abuse are used as predictors for self harm (adjusted ORs are given on Table 2, p. 4) but no statistical information is given on the association between bullying and drug abuse.\n24 Messerschmidt (2011). Qualitative study (p. 207), which does not report statistical results for meta-analysis.\n25 Muula et al. (2009). Although drug use is measured, its results are presented combined with alcohol use (p. 2 and Table 1 p. 3). The association between bullying and drug (substance abuse) is not given in this report.\n26 Nansel et al. (2001). The study reports information for alcohol and smoking instead of actual drugs (p. 2098).\n27 Pe\xcc\x81rez Milena et al. (2010). Table 2 (p. 27) gives the percentage of non-victims, victims and perpetrators who do drugs. However, the exact sample size of each group is not specified and the OR cannot be calculated (see also p. 23 where the percentage of each group is given, but there is an overlap between groups that total more than 100%).\n28 Peeters, Cillessen, and Scholte (2010). Excluded for two reasons: a) drug use and bullying are used as predictors for suicidal ideation but the association of the two predictors is not given (see Table 2 p. 268); and b) also, bullying is part of a total score which also includes \xe2\x80\x9cabuse and taunting\xe2\x80\x9d (see Table 2,\np. 268).\n29 Rivers, Poteat, Noret, and Ashurst (2009). The outcome measure, substance\nuse, includes both drugs and alcohol use (p. 215).\n30 Romani and Gutie\xcc\x81rrez (2010). Although the paper includes data on the\nassociation of school bullying and drug use, it was incomplete for effect sizes calculation. The author was contacted by mail, but the additional information is not yet available.\n31 Saluja et al. (2004). Although drug use is measured (p. 762). Bullying and drug use are both used as predictors for depression (see Tables 2 and 3\np. 763), but the study didn't present statistical results regarding the association between bullying and drug use.\n32 Santinello and Vieno (2008). Although bullying perpetration and cannabis use are measured (p. 15), their association is not presented in subsequent analyses.\n33 Sobotkova, Blatny, Jelinek, and Hrdlicka (2012). The study focuses on Antisocial behaviour. Although the authors report results on marijuana use at school (see Table 3 p. 9), there is not measure (p. 8) referring to bullying behaviour.\n34 Tharp-taylor, Haviland, and D'Amico (2009). The paper shows effect sizes for bullying victimisation versus drug use after controlling for prior drug use (see Table 3b, p. 565). However, the study is excluded because Risk Ratios are presented and they cannot be included in the meta-analysis.\n35 Vaughn et al. (2010). The sample involves individuals aged 18 or older.\n36 Volk, Craig, Boyce, and King (2006). The statistical information provided does\nnot allow calculating effect sizes for all the categories defined for the\nmeta-analysis.\n37 Wang, Iannotti, and Luk (2012). Substance use includes alcohol and drugs\n(p. 525).\n38 Waters et al. (1999). The outcome measure is \xe2\x80\x98drug concern\xe2\x80\x99 (see Table 2, p.\n30) and the report does not provide statistical information for bullied children\nversus drug use (Tables 3 and 4, p. 31).\n39 Zaborskis and Vareikiene (2008) A translation of this report was required.\nHowever, the report with results in English is not yet available.\n      \nReferences1\n**Adelmann, P.K.

Introduction\nInitiation of substance use at an early age is a significant predictor for later substance abuse and delinquent behaviors (Halfors et al., 2002). Drug use during adolescence typically continues into adult- hood (Arteaga, Chen, & Reynolds, 2010). Substance use is increasing among Taiwan youth (Gau, Chong, Chen, & Cheng, 2005). High prevalence of substance use disorders was found among adolescent students in Taiwan with psychiatric comorbid conditions similar to those in Western countries (Chong, Chan, & Cheng, 1999). Illicit drug use prevalence was 6.4% among adolescent students in Taiwan,\n\xe2\x81\x8e Corresponding author. Tel.: +886 2 77341737. E-mail address: jonglong@ntnu.edu.tw (J.-L.

Between September 2010 and January 2011, a randomized sample was drawn from 33 vocational high school night classes, enrolling 1079 students already employed outside campus. Subjects completed a validated self- reported questionnaire measuring proximal factors (biological, psychological, and behavioral) and distal factors (living with parents, parents' or siblings' use of legal substances, supervision by primary guardian, and perceived peer influence on drug use). Age, greater sensation-seeking behavior and legal substances use (i.e., tobacco and betel nuts) increased odds of being identified as experimental or regular users versus non-drug users. Higher rates of rule-breaking behavior were associated with increased odds of being identi- fied as experimental users versus non-drug users. Among distal factors, only perceived peer influence on drug use was significantly associated with experimental and regular drug use. Proximal and distal factors were associated with drug use patterns among vocational high school night-class students. Influence factors iden- tified may help vocational high school officials design effective illicit drug intervention programs for students with different drug use patterns.\n  \xc2\xa9 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\nand a dose/response relationship was found between drinking (prev- alence 70.7%), tobacco smoking (prevalence 56%) illicit drug use and exposure to other risk factors (Yang, Yand, Liu, & Ko, 1998).\nThe present study focused on the under-investigated, at-risk pop- ulation of vocational high school night class students, many of whom are employed in work-study programs off campus. Among adolescent students working part time while in school, 25% smoked cigarettes and 30% drank alcohol; estimates of illicit drug use and heavy illicit drug use were 16.7% and 1.8%, respectively, and accessibility of legal sub- stances (e.g., alcohol, tobacco, betel nuts) and illicit drugs (e.g., ketamine, cannabis, heroin) was higher in the work environment (Wu, Schlenger, & Galvin, 2003). The work and job training environment outside school communicates a norm for smoking and drinking, making it more likely that students exposed to this pro-substance use environment will en- counter illicit drugs than regular high school students.

Huang et al. / Addictive Behaviors 38 (2013) 1481\xe2\x80\x931484\nto determine the relative influence of proximal and distal factors in specif- ic drug use patterns. Our study results may help develop effective preven- tive approaches to meet the needs of adolescents with different drug use patterns.\n2. Methods\n2.1. Participants\nA population-based sample was drawn from 377 vocational high school night classes with combined enrollment of 14,575 students in northern Taiwan. The 377 night classes of 17 vocational high schools randomly selected a number from an envelope containing numbers 1 to 377; 10% of classes (n=37) were randomly selected to participate in the survey. Finally, 33 classes agreed to participate, yielding a sample of 1 120 students. All students from selected night classes (range, 17\xe2\x80\x9350 students per class) were invited by letter to participate. A total of 1079 students (96.34%) agreed to participate and complete the survey and, before beginning, all students and parents/guardians provided signed informed consent but no names was marked on questionnaires to ensure confidentiality. The ques- tionnaire took approximately 30 minutes to complete. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of National Yang-Ming University.\n2.2. Measures\nCorrelates related to drug use patterns were divided into proximal and distal factors. Proximal factors comprised biological, psychological, and behavioral factors. The biological factors included age and gender. The psychological factor was measured by a short sensation-seeking scale (BSSS-8) comprising sensation seeking: thrill and adventure seeking, experience seeking, disinhibition and boredom susceptibility (Palmgreen, Donohew, Lorch, Hoyle, & Stephenson, 2001; Stephenson, Velez, Chalela, Ramirez, & Hoyle, 2007). Behavioral factors included students' self-reported use of legal substances (i.e., tobacco, alcohol, and betel nuts), rule-breaking behavior, and extent of missing classes. Distal factors included: living with both parents, legal substances use by parent(s) or sibling(s), supervision by primary guardian (five items) (Bahr, Hoffmann, & Yang, 2005; Martins, Storr, Alexandre, & Chilcoat, 2008; Wang, Matthew, Bellamy, & James, 2005), and perceived peer influence to use illicit drugs (11 items) (Korhonen et al., 2008; Lundborg, 2006; Romer & Hennessy, 2007). Participants were classified into three groups based on drug use patterns: non-drug users, experi- mental users (tried drugs once and/or used drugs occasionally), and regular users (used drugs in established patterns, regularly/frequently). Experimental use refers to short-term, non-patterned use typically motivated by curiosity and regular use refers to an established pattern of frequent use (Connell, Gilreath, Aklin, & Brex, 2010).\n2.3. Validity of the instrument\nA pilot test of the original instrument was conducted with 60 students from two representative vocational high school night classes. Content validity and readability analyses were conducted. Based on pilot test results, the instrument was slightly revised. Coef- ficients of test-retest reliability were greater than or equal to 0.80 among all factors. Factor analysis was done for each of 3 multi-item scales. Sensation seeking (proximal factor), supervision by primary guardian (distal factor) and peer influence on drug use (distal factors) on each scale accounted for 63.82%, 55.70% to 66.90% of variance, respectively. Estimates of reliability were calculated using Cronbach's alpha; all 3 measures were greater than or equal to 0.80.\n2.4. Statistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed using SPSS 15.0 statistics soft- ware (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). Continuous data are expressed as mean with standard deviation (mean\xc2\xb1SD) and categorical data as n (%). To evaluate associations, one-way ANOVA test with Bonferroni adjustment approach was applied for comparisons of continuous var- iables and Pearson Chi-square test for comparisons of categorical var- iables. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was performed to identify proximal and distal influence factors relative to user groups (non-drug users, experimental users, regular users). All parameters significantly associated with drug use patterns were then put into multinomial logistic regression analysis. All statistical assessments were considered significant at p b 0.05.\n3. Results\n3.1. Demographic characteristics and drug use behavior\nAmong 1079 students, 881 (81.7%) were non-drug users, 147 (13.6%) were experimental users and 51 (4.7%) were regular users; 648 (60.1%) were males (mean age 17.5 years; SD=1.6). A total of 672(62.3%)students were living with both parents.\n3.2. Dispersion of students' proximal and distal influencing factors be- tween three groups\nAll proximal factors (biological factors, psychological factor, and be- havioral factors) were significantly higher in experimental users and regular users compared with the non-drug-users (all P b 0.001), except for gender. For psychological factor, sensation seeking scores were higher in students with more regular drug use (regular users > experimental users > non-drug-users). Percentages of tobacco use (30.1%), alcohol use (34.2%), betel nut use (10.3%), rule-breaking behavior (59.6%), and miss- ing classes (58.3%) were significantly lower among non-drug users than among experimental users (44.9\xe2\x80\x9391.2%) or regular users (58.8\xe2\x80\x9390.2%) (Table 1).\nAmong distal factors, the percentage of non-drug users whose sib- ling(s) had used legal substances (35.3%) was significantly lower than that of experimental users (59.9%) or regular users (56.9%). More frequent drug use correlated with higher scores in peer influence on drug use (regular users 25.39 > experimental users 20.58 > non-drug users 13.34). Supervision by primary guardian was lower in the drug user groups (13.16-13.82) than in the non-drug user group (15.47) (Table 1).\n3.3. Factors associated with regularity of drug use\nAll proximal and distal influence factors were analyzed, except for living with both parents and legal substances use by parents, which showed no significant differences among the three groups. Within proximal factors, after controlling for other factors, older students were at increased odds for being identified as regular users compared to non-drug users (Table 2). Greater sensation seeking was associated with increased odds for being identified as experimental users or regular users versus non-drug users. Regularity of drug use was asso- ciated with several behavioral factors, especially legal substances use (i.e., tobacco and betel nuts) (Table 2). Higher levels of tobacco use and betel nut use increased odds of being identified as experimental users or regular users versus non-drug users. Higher rates of rule- breaking behavior were associated with increased odds of being iden- tified as experimental users than as non-drug users (Table 2). Among distal factors, only peer influence on drug use was associated with significant differentiation between non-drug users and experimental users and regular users. Higher perceived peer influence on drug use was associated with increased odds of being identified as experimental\nDownloaded for Anonymous User (n/a) at University of Washington - Seattle - WSC from ClinicalKey.com by Elsevier on April 20, 2017.

Overall accuracy of the final prediction model is 86.7% (Table 2).\n4. Discussion\nOur results strongly support the hypothesis that proximal and dis- tal factors affect vocational high school night-class students on the drug use patterns, which is classified as non-drug users, experimental users and regular users. Proximal factors producing larger effects than distal factors on classifying and differentiating drug use patterns. Legal addictive substances use (tobacco and betel nuts) had the sig- nificant effects on the drug use patterns. Among distal factors, per- ceived peer influence on using drugs was closely associated with drug use patterns but supervision by primary guardian was not.\nLifetime prevalence of illicit drug use by vocational school students in Taiwan was 2.3\xe2\x80\x932.7% (Chen, 2005; Chou, Ho, Chen, & Chen, 2006). In this study, lifetime prevalence was 18.3% and differ- ences may be due to investigating only vocational high school night-class students. Unlike full-time high school students, most vocational high school night-class students work days, making them both student and employee. In addition, about 50% of learning time is spent in workplace training. Those features made them affordable to buy substances (Mortimer, Finch, Ryu, Shanahan, & Call, 1996) and higher chance to be exposed to a pro-substance use environment (Wu et al., 2003).\nWe found the largest effects on class membership were by legal use of tobacco, alcohol, and betel nuts. Unlike reports of Western cultures showing strong associations between alcohol use and drug use (Poorasl, Vahidi, Fakhari, Rostami, & Dastghiri, 2007), our findings revealed a culture-specific phenomenon, pointing to the strong effects of tobacco use on class membership closely followed by betel nuts, while alcohol had no significant effect on drug use. Lifetime prevalence of betel nut use among high school students (3.3\xe2\x80\x937.3%) was previously reported to be lower than that of tobacco (17.8\xe2\x80\x93 25.8%) or alcohol use (42.1\xe2\x80\x9343.1%) (Chen et al., 2009). However, after adjusting for other factors, we observed a significant association between betel nuts chewing and illicit drug use, suggesting important implications of betel nuts chewing for illicit drug prevention and intervention. Psychological factor such as sensation seeking tenden- cies also closely associated with illicit drug use, which was similar to the findings of other studies (Martins et al., 2008; Yanovitzky, 2005).\nAmong distal factors, peer influence had better predictive ability than family influence among vocational high school night-class stu- dents, especially for distinguishing experimental and regular users from non-drug users. While the influence of family factors decreases with time, the influence of peer factors increases with time (Guo, Hill, Hawkins, Catalano, & Abbott, 2002).\nLimitations of this study include use of a single specific sample population, limiting generalizability of study findings. Also, data were only self reported and no drug testing was done, which could influence interpretation of results. However, evidence suggests that adolescent self-reports are reliable, valid, and do not usually result in systematic reporting bias (Needle, McCubbin, Lorence, & Hochhauser, 1983).\nC.-M.

Previous research also indicates that LGBT youth who attend high schools with a gay-straight alliance (GSA) report having fewer alcohol problems and lower levels of cigarette smoking. The present study investigates whether the absence of a GSA is associated with risk for illicit drug use and prescription drug misuse in a sample of 475 LGBT high school students (M age =16.79) who completed an online survey. After controlling for demographic variables and risk factors associated with illicit drug use, the results of 12 logistic regression analyses revealed that LGBT youth attending a high school without a GSA evidenced increased risk for using cocaine (adjusted odds ratio [adjOR] = 3.11; 95% confidence in- terval [95% CI] = 1.23\xe2\x80\x937.86), hallucinogens (adjOR = 2.59; 95% CI = 1.18\xe2\x80\x935.70), and marijuana (adjOR = 2.22; 95% CI = 1.37\xe2\x80\x933.59) relative to peers attending a high school with a GSA. Youth without a GSA also evidenced increased risk for the misuse of ADHD medication (adjOR = 2.00; 95% CI = 1.02\xe2\x80\x933.92) and prescription pain medication (adjOR = 2.00; 95% CI = 1.10\xe2\x80\x933.65). These findings extend the research base rela- ted to GSAs and further demonstrate the importance of providing LGBT youth with opportunities for socialization and support within the school setting. Important limitations of the present study are reviewed.\n\xc2\xa9 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n    1.

Specifically, LGB youth evidence increased risk for past-year amphetamine, cocaine, ecstasy, hallucinogen, heroin, and marijuana use, and prescription medication misuse (Corliss et al., 2010). Studies utilizing adult samples of transgender individuals indicate that this population may also be at risk for using illicit drugs and misusing prescription drugs (Benotsch et al., 2013; Herbst et al., 2008) and\nexplanatory models (Meyer, 1995, 2003) for the elevated rates of mental health and substance use problems among LGB individuals may general- ize to transgender populations (Hendricks & Testa, 2012).\nGreater rates of substance use among lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) adolescents are often linked to minority-specific stressors, which are rooted in societal heterosexism (see Hendricks & Testa, 2012; Meyer, 1995, 2003). For example, LGB youth are more like- ly to experience victimization perpetrated by parents/caregivers and peers than heterosexual youth (Fedewa & Ahn, 2011; Friedman et al., 2011). Transgender youth are also likely to experience elevated rates of school-based victimization and parental rejection (Grossman, D'Augelli, Howell, & Hubbard, 2005; McGuire, Anderson, Toomey, & Russell, 2010). In turn, experiencing rejection and victimization is asso- ciated with increased illicit drug use and prescription drug misuse among LGBT youth (Bontempo & D'Augelli, 2002; Kecojevic et al., 2012; Mclaughlin et al., 2012; Rosario, Schrimshaw, & Hunter, 2009; Ryan, Huebner, Diaz, & Sanchez, 2010).\nOne factor that appears to promote positive health outcomes for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) youth involves attending a high school with a gay-straight alliance (GSA). A GSA is a school-based club that works to create a supportive school environment for all stu- dents, regardless of sexual orientation and/or gender identity and expression. Research suggests that attending a high school with a GSA can reduce the burden of minority stressors (Goodenow, Szalacha, & Westheimer, 2006; Heck, Flentje, & Cochran, 2011; Heck, Lindquist, Stewart, Brennan, & Cochran, 2013). Specifically, LGBT youth attending schools with GSAs report experiencing less school-based victimization, a greater sense of school belonging, and less concealment of their sexual minority statuses (Goodenow et al., 2006; Heck et al., 2011, 2013; Kosciw, Palmer, Kull, & Greytak, 2013). Goodenow et al. (2006) reported that GSAs were associated with lower risk for suicide in adolescence, while Toomey, Ryan, Diaz, and Russell (2011) found that this reduction in suicide risk also extended into young adulthood. Attending schools with GSAs also appears to be associated with lower levels of cigarette use, alcohol consumption, and alcohol-related problems among LGBT adolescents and young adults (Heck et al., 2011; Poteat, DiGiovanni, Sinclair, Koenig, & Russell, 2013).\nThe present study extends previous research by investigating the re- lationship between GSAs and drug use using a large sample of LGBT youth. It is hypothesized that after controlling for demographic and potential confounding variables, LGBT youth attending a high school without a GSA will evidence greater risk for lifetime illicit drug use and prescription drug misuse, relative to peers attending a school with a GSA.\n2. Method\n2.1. Participants and inclusion criteria\nThe sample included adolescents who completed an online survey about factors and experiences that contribute to mental health and sub- stance use outcomes. Inclusion criteria specified that participants had to be at least 16 years old and attending a public or private high school. Participants also had to identify as LGBT, or with another sexual or gender minority identity (queer, pansexual, etc.). Participants who identified as heterosexual (n = 40) were included in the sample if they endorsed having same-sex sexual attractions or engaging in same-sex sexual behavior.\nParticipants included 179 male, 257 female, and 39 transgender (male to female n = 7; female to male n = 17) or other (n = 15) gender-identified high school students (mean age = 16.79; SD = 0.78). Ethnic minorities represented approximately 30% of the sam- ple; 51 participants identified as Hispanic, 36 identified as African American, 17 as Native American, 16 as Asian American, and 26 selected an \xe2\x80\x9cother\xe2\x80\x9d option to reflect their ethnicities. Using United States Census Bureau (1994) coding for regions, 165 participants were from Western\nstates, while 147, 82, and 81 participants were from Southern, North- eastern, and Midwestern states, respectively. Additional demographic characteristics of the sample are included in Table 1.\n2.2. Procedure\nData were collected between September 2011 and April 2012. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the authors' home institution, and a waiver of parental permission was granted for 16 and 17 year olds. Participants were recruited using a recruit- ment message (for online recruitment via the social networking site Facebook) or flyers and business cards (for recruitment from LGBT community centers, LGBT community groups, and school- based LGBT groups). As an incentive, participants could enter into a raffle to win one of ten $10 gift cards for agreeing to complete a five-item screener, and enter into a second raffle to win one of ten $20 gift cards if they qualified for the study and agreed to participate.\n2.3. Measures\nParticipants reported their age, grade in school, race/ethnicity, rela- tionship status, gender, sexual orientation (both categorical: bisexual, gay or lesbian, straight or heterosexual, unsure, or other; and continu- ous: 1 [Heterosexual or Straight] to 9 [Gay or Lesbian]), the size of their city or town, and type of high school (i.e., public or private). GSA status was assessed using the item, \xe2\x80\x9cDoes your high school have a gay-straight student alliance, queer alliance, or group for LGBT students and their allies?\xe2\x80\x9d with yes/no response options.\nChildhood abuse was measured using the Childhood Trauma Ques- tionnaire, Short-Form (CTQ-SF; Bernstein et al., 2003). Community cli- mate for LGBT people was assessed using the sum of two items, rated from 1 to 5 (lower scores representing safe and accepting communi- ties), \xe2\x80\x9cPlease rate how safe your community is for LGBT people\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cPlease rate how accepting your community is of LGBT people.\xe2\x80\x9d Parental acceptance was assessed with two items measuring reactions to learning about their child's sexual identity (ranging from 1: Rejecting to 5: Accepting). A modified Olweus Bullying and Victimization Scale (Olweus, 1994) was used to assess school victimization.\nLifetime drug use was assessed with yes/no response options to hav- ing ever used: cocaine, ecstasy, GHB/ketamine/Rohypnol, hallucino- gens, heroin, inhalants, marijuana, methamphetamines, and steroids and \xe2\x80\x9crecreational/non-medical use\xe2\x80\x9d of: prescription stimulants, anti- anxiety medication or prescription pain medications (with examples given for the different drug classes).\n2.4. Statistical analysis\nChi-square tests of independence for categorical variables and inde- pendent samples t-tests for continuous variables were used to test for group differences on demographic variables and the selected covariates. Covariates (childhood trauma, community climate, parental acceptance, and school victimization) were included in our models based on their relationship with drug use among sexual minority populations. For each of our 12 logistic regressions, we entered demographic variables (ethnicity, population size, gender, continuous sexual orientation, and school type [private versus public]) at block one, covariates at block two, and GSA status in block three (with GSA as reference group). The analyses were carried out using IBM SPSS Statistics 20.0 (IBM Corp., 2011).\n3. Results\nComplete results of demographic and covariate comparisons by GSA status are reported in Table 1. Participants without a GSA were more likely to identify their gender as male, identify their sexual orientation as gay or lesbian, attend private school, attend high school in smaller\nN.C.

There was no detectable difference between participants with and without a GSA on lifetime use of ecstasy, GHB/Rohypnol, inhalants, methamphetamine, steroids, or anti-anxiety medications. As only four participants endorsed lifetime heroin use, we did not test for group differences.\n4. Discussion\nPrevious research indicates that attending a high school with a GSA is associated with favorable outcomes with respect to alcohol and ciga- rette use among LGBT youth and young adults (Heck et al., 2011; Poteat et al., 2013). To our knowledge, this is the first study to detect an asso- ciation between attending a high school without a GSA and increased risk for use of illicit drugs. These important results extend previous research by further documenting the potential benefits associated with attending a high school with a GSA for a population that demon- strates increased risk for illicit drug use (Corliss et al., 2010; Marshal et al., 2008).\nWe anticipated that these results are achieved because GSAs help foster school environments where the burden of minority stressors is reduced. One mechanism to explain the association between GSAs and illicit drug use may involve school-based victimization. Given that LGBT youth attending high schools with GSAs tend to re- port experiencing lower levels of victimization (Goodenow et al., 2006; Heck et al., 2011; Kosciw et al., 2013) and school-based victim- ization, especially when experienced at high levels, is associated with illicit drug use among LGB youth (Bontempo & D'Augelli, 2002), the relationship between attending a school with a GSA and illicit drug use may be moderated by the effect of victimization. GSAs may also provide LGBT youth with an environment that is mon- itored by responsible adults and a place to socialize in the absence of alcohol and drugs. Both of these factors may contribute to lower levels of illicit drug use and non-medical use of prescription drugs for LGBT youth and should be evaluated with future research.\nAttending a high school with a GSA is associated with favorable aca- demic, mental health, and substance-related outcomes for LGB and LGBT youth (Goodenow et al., 2006; Heck et al., 2011; Poteat et al., 2013; Toomey et al., 2011; Walls, Kane, & Wisneski, 2010). The present findings underscore the importance of providing LGBT youth with school-based support groups and highlight the potential damaging effects of not having these resources in our nation's schools. In a recent study of 8584 LGBT youth who participated in the 2011 National School Climate Survey (Kosciw, Greytak, Bartkiewicz, Boesen, & Palmer, 2012), nearly 54% reported that their schools did not have a GSA or similar school-based support group. Clearly there is room to increase LGBT youths' access to school-based support groups within the United States.\nMeyer and Bayer (2013) review the ethical and legal concerns that can arise when attempting to establish affirmative school-based inter- ventions conflicts with religious beliefs. Undoubtedly, in some parts of the United States where LGBT youth do not have access to affirmative school-based support, these conflicts will (and have) come about. The establishment of affirmative school-based support groups for LGBT youth in communities where the acceptance of LGBT people is low may be best achieved when researchers utilize principles of community- based participatory research so that feedback and modification from key stakeholders can inform the implementation process (Meyer & Bayer, 2013).\nAlthough the results of this study are important, they are not with- out limitations. First, causation cannot be inferred regarding GSAs and the substance use/misuse variables based on the present design. A second limitation involves the utilization of convenience sampling methodology. This could limit the generalizability of our findings due to self-selection bias. Future research with larger samples should\nexamine whether the present findings hold true across levels of gender and ethnicity to further elucidate the potential benefits associated with attending a high school with a GSA. Researchers must continue to inves- tigate the potential benefits of having GSAs in our nation's schools, which in turn may help improve the lives and health of LGBT youth in our nation.\nRole of funding source\nThis research was supported by a grant from the National GLBTQ Youth Foundation awarded to the Nicholas Heck.

However, methodological difficulties, particularly the difficulty of obtaining a representative sample, have limited the ability to draw conclusions about LGBT individuals who receive services for substance abuse. This study took advantage of a unique opportunity to examine a representative sample of openly LGBT clients receiving publicly funded substance abuse treatment by using data gathered by treatment providers in Washington State. Baseline differences between openly LGBT and heterosexual clients were compared in a variety of domains. Results demonstrated that openly LGBT clients enter treatment with more severe substance abuse problems, greater psychopathology, and greater medical service utilization when compared with heterosexual clients. When the analyses were stratified based on sex, different patterns of substance use and associated psychosocial characteristics emerged for the LGBT clients.

Introduction\nMore research is needed to identify factors related to the development and maintenance of SUDs among lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals with sub- stance use disorders (SUDs) to address this population\xe2\x80\x99s needs. There are several unanswered questions, or con- troversial issues, about substance abuse and substance abuse treatment among LGBT individuals. These include (1) whether the development of substance abuse problems is different among LGBT individuals from that among heterosexual individuals, (2) whether the prevalence of alcohol and other substance abuse is different among LGBT individuals from that among heterosexual individuals, and\n4 Corresponding author.

The present study addresses these primary questions and controversies in the field through an investigation of the relationship between sexual orientation and substance abuse among a large sample of clients receiving publicly supported treatment.\n1.1. A causal relationship between sexual orientation and substance abuse?\nA primary area of controversy is the nature of the relationship between sexual orientation and substance abuse. Social pressures and discrimination at many levels may limit the opportunities that LGBT individuals have to socialize. As a result, socializing can be limited to bars or to other places where substance abuse is the norm (Cabaj, 1996; Colcher, 1982). Others propose that alcohol and other substance use are initiated as coping strategies to deal with the discrimination and sex-role expectations directly\n  \n136 B.N. Cochran, A.M. Cauce / Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment 30 (2006) 135\xe2\x80\x93146\n(Diamond & Wilsnack, 1978; Meyer, 1995). The most prevalent explanation of the link between substance abuse and LGBT status is internalized homophobia. In this view, LGBT individuals adopt the dominant culture\xe2\x80\x99s discrim- inatory attitudes toward them, directing those attitudes toward the self. Diminished self-esteem, shame about one\xe2\x80\x99s own sexual orientation, and psychological disorder may result from internalized homophobia. From this perspective, one would hypothesize that levels of internalized homopho- bia would correlate positively with substance abuse in LGBT individuals (the studies of Jaffe, 1999, and Jurek, 1999, provide some support for this hypothesis). As a theoretical construct, however, internalized homophobia has received much criticism in recent years. Namely, many researchers believe that by creating a construct that is within the person rather than based in society\xe2\x80\x99s discrimination, LGBT individ- uals are further pathologized (e.g., Williamson, 2000).\nIn summary, there are two perceived mechanisms by which increased stress caused by stigmatization may result in greater likelihood of psychiatric disorder and substance abuse: (1) stress may directly influence an individual\xe2\x80\x99s daily living experiences and (2) stress in the form of discrim- ination may be internalized, leading to increased shame and substance use.\n1.2. Substance abuse epidemiology and sexual orientation\nEpidemiological studies on the prevalence of substance abuse in the LGBT community have been fraught with sampling problems. The earliest and most widely cited studies on this nature were conducted by Lohrenz, Connelly, Coyne, and Spare (1978) and Saghir and Robins (1973). Both of these studies published rates of alcoholism at approximately 30%, a figure that appears frequently in the literature. However, like most early studies, their sampling was conducted at places where LGBT individuals congre- gated socially (namely, gay bars). Obviously, this sampling methodology is likely to overestimate the prevalence of substance abuse problems in the LGBT community.\nA more recent study (McKirnan & Peterson, 1989) addressed this methodological problem by recruiting par- ticipants through an LGBT-oriented weekly newspaper circulated in Chicago. They found lower rates of abstainers from alcohol among gay men and lesbians than among the general population (14% vs. 29%, respectively), as well as a higher proportion of moderate drinkers (71% vs. 57%, respectively). No difference was found in rates of heavy drinking between gay men and lesbians and the heterosexual population, but higher rates of alcohol-related problems were reported among the gay men and lesbian sample (23% vs. 12% of the heterosexual population). Interestingly, the gay men and lesbians in their sample did not show a decline in rates of alcohol consumption with increasing age, as is typically evidenced in the heterosexual population.\nHughes and Eliason (2002) presented a recent review of the literature relating sexual orientation to misuse of\nsubstances. They highlighted the importance of increased stress in the lives of LGBT individuals that may be a causal mechanism for increased substance use. Specifically, they detailed the increased likelihood that LGBT individuals may have experienced victimization in childhood, may be at increased risk for domestic violence, and may be more likely to have partners who drink or abuse substances. The relationship between stress and increased risk for psychiatric disorders was also presented by Cochran (2001), who reviewed four epidemiological studies that indicated increased risk of disorder among lesbians and gay men and noted that LGBT individuals perceive greater day-to- day discrimination than heterosexual individuals. In this view, some vulnerable LGBT individuals may turn to sub- stance abuse as a dysfunctional means of coping with addi- tional stressors not faced by the heterosexual population.\nOnly one study examined substance use among LGBT individuals from a longitudinal perspective; data from the Christchurch Health and Development Study, a 21-year study on a birth cohort of 1,265 children from New Zealand, were analyzed with sexual orientation as an independent variable (Fergusson, Horwood, & Beautrais, 1999). Of the 1,007 participants reinterviewed at age 21 years, 28 either endorsed a gay, lesbian, or bisexual orientation or had had sexual relationships with a same-sex partner after the age of 16 years. Participants were assessed with a structured interview that resulted in a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (American Psychiatric Association, 1994) diagnostic status for major psychiatric conditions, and odds ratios (ORs) were com- puted to determine elevated risk of disorder as a function of LGBT status. Results indicated an OR of 1.9 (95% confidence interval = 0.9\xe2\x80\x934.2) for the relationship between LGBT sexual identity and substance abuse or dependence.\nBecause few epidemiological studies have assessed participant sexual orientation, it is difficult to draw conclusions about the prevalence of substance abuse or dependence among LGBT individuals in the general population. A notable exception is the recent study of Cochran, Ackerman, Mays, & Ross (2004), which used data from the 1996 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse. In this study, although participants were not asked about their sexual orientation, they were asked about the gender of their sexual partners during the previous 12 months. The 194 individuals who reported same-sex or both-sex sexual partners were more likely to endorse symptoms of substance dependence. Lifetime use of any illicit substance was significantly greater for men with male partners (72.8%) than for men without same-sex sexual behaviors in the previous year (54.6%). For women, the corresponding rates for lifetime use of an illicit substance were 77.9% for women with female partners and 42.3% for women with male partners only. For illicit drug use in the previous month, men with same-sex sexual behaviors were more likely to endorse use of cocaine (3.9%) in comparison with men with female partners only (1.2%); however, no other\nB.N. Cochran, A.M. Cauce / Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment 30 (2006) 135\xe2\x80\x93146 137\ndrug category was significantly different for previous month use based on sexual behavior histories for men. The authors noted that symptoms related to problem methamphetamine use were not assessed in the study, which may have resulted in an underestimation of problems among men who have sex with men.\nFor women, past month substance use was significantly greater among those with same-sex sexual behavior for marijuana (14.0% vs. 3.4%), analgesics (3.3% vs. 0.5%), and any illicit drug (15.1% vs. 4.5%). In terms of problems associated with drug use, men with same-sex sexual histories were more likely to report symptoms of problematic drug use (OR = 2.4) than men with female partners only; this effect was most associated with marijuana use. For women, the risk of substance use problems was greater for those with same- sex sexual behavior for marijuana use (OR = 4.9), cocaine use (OR = 3.7), and hallucinogen use (OR = 4.4). This pattern of results is the first to indicate, in a national sample, that there is a risk of greater substance abuse problems among individuals with same-sex sexual partners.\nResponding to community health needs, most of the recent studies involving LGBT individuals and substance abuse have focused on two populations of gay men: (1) those who are HIV positive and (2) those who are methamphet- amine dependent. Chesney, Barrett, and Stall (1998) con- ducted, as part of the San Francisco Men\xe2\x80\x99s Health Study, an analysis of men who seroconverted to an HIV-positive status during the first 7 years of the study. They examined a number of possible factors that may have resulted in increased risk for the participants who became HIV positive in each assessment wave; after controlling for sexual risk, partic- ipants\xe2\x80\x99 history of amphetamine, cocaine, or inhalant use was the only significant predictor of seroconversion. The authors suggested three possible mechanisms for this relationship: the physiological effects of stimulants and inhalants during sexual activity, a disposition toward risk taking in multiple areas, and social networks in which both substance use and sexual behavior co-occur.\nSeveral recent studies have honed in on the increasing rates of methamphetamine use among gay men (e.g., Halkitis, Parsons, & Stirratt, 2001). A recent retrospective chart review of outpatients in a stimulant treatment program found that methamphetamine users, as compared with cocaine users, were more likely to identify as gay or bisexual, in addition to being at increased risk for HIV and having more psychiatric comorbidity (Copeland & Sorensen, 2001). Guss (2000, p. 108) theorized about the reasons that gay men often pair the use of stimulants with sexual activity: bif a sexual experience is combined with intranasal or smoked cocaine or crystal methamphetamine, powerful and reciprocally enhancing experiences occur. Fears of rejection or overwhelming reactions to rejection are diminished.Q In this view, the fears of rejection that are likely heightened by shame and internalized homophobia may lead gay men to seek drug experiences that temporarily paralyze these negative messages. Other findings about the use of meth-\namphetamine among gay men point to either a general risk- seeking temperament or lowered inhibitions through stimu- lant use. A study on 162 gay and bisexual men in treatment for methamphetamine dependence indicated that prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases in the sample correlated significantly with psychiatric diagnoses (Shoptaw, Peck, Reback, & Rotheram-Fulller, 2003). Men with specific phobias and major depression were more likely to contract oral gonorrhea, men with generalized anxiety disorder were more likely to contract genital gonorrhea, men with social phobia were more likely to contract syphilis, and men with bipolar disorder were more likely to be HIV positive. It is possible that anxiety-disordered gay men, in particular, who may ordinarily avoid social situations owing to their anxiety, would be prone to use stimulants that lower their inhibitions for both meeting other men and for engaging in risky sexual activities. Supporting this theory is a qualitative analysis of reasons that gay men who are HIV positive use methamphet- amine (Semple, Patterson, & Grant, 2002). In this study, motivations for methamphetamine use clustered around sexual enhancement and self-medication of negative affect associated with being HIV positive. At this point, the research quite clearly suggests that gay and bisexual men are at increased risk of using substances, particularly stimulants, to ameliorate negative views of themselves and as a form of sexual disinhibition.\nThere are some speculations that alcohol abuse may be declining in the LGBT community, particularly among gay men, with increased recognition that alcohol impairment is related to unsafe sexual decisions (see Paul, Stall, & Bloomfield, 1991, for a review). Empirical evidence for this proposition was found when comparing data from the San Francisco Men\xe2\x80\x99s Health Study in 1984 with those from the San Francisco Young Men\xe2\x80\x99s Health Survey in 1992 (Crosby, Stall, Paul, & Barrett, 1998). The latter survey indicated declines in heavy alcohol use and larger declines in overall drug use. Specifically, use of drugs in the past 12 months was significantly lower in 1992 for marijuana (64.2% vs. 85.3%), poppers (62.2% vs. 23.9%), cocaine (71.1% vs. 24.3%), downers (35.0% vs. 11.2%), heroin (7.7% vs. 1.1%), amphetamines (44.1% vs. 25.4%), and ethyl chloride (7.0% vs. 2.6%). The exception to this trend was an increase in the use of ecstasy (MDA) from 14.7% to 31.3%. It is significant to note, however, that dramatic changes in the gay community have occurred since these data were collected, specifically the discovery of antiretro- viral bcocktailsQ that prolong life for patients with HIV. Consequently, the meaning of HIV infection has changed in the LGBT community in the past decade, and it is unclear whether the reported decrease in alcohol and substance use has continued.\nRegardless of the actual prevalence rate of alcohol and other drug problems in the LGBT community and of the causal factors involved, it does appear that a greater proportion of LGBT individuals experience problems related to substance use and that these problems continue\n138 B.N. Cochran, A.M. Cauce / Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment 30 (2006) 135\xe2\x80\x93146\ninto later ages as compared with their heterosexual coun- terparts. Further research may both clarify the extent of the problem and include populations that are less frequent- ly the targets of study\xe2\x80\x94specifically, bisexual individuals and lesbians.\n1.3. Substance abuse treatment for LGBT individuals\nDespite the high rates of alcohol and other substance abuse in the LGBT community, treatment providers are not responding to these needs. Chemical dependence treatment providers receive limited or no training in working with LGBT individuals and rarely discuss sexual orientation with their clients, although they believe that these issues are important (Hellman, Stanton, Lee, Tytun, & Vachon, 1989). Traditional treatment may also not be as effective for LGBT individuals with SUDs. In one study, gay men and lesbians showed less affiliation toward Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) after undergoing residential alcohol treatment than hetero- sexual individuals. For those LGBT individuals who were affiliated with AA, abstinence rates were lower than expected (Holleran & Novak, 1989). The authors theorized that LGBT individuals may view AA as a hostile or nonsupportive environment, particularly given its religious origins. As such, LGBT individuals may be currently underserved by substance abuse treatment programs. The impact of biases against LGBT individuals that may exist in their substance abuse treatment providers has not been studied. A survey found that 59% of LGBT respondents expressed a preference for LGBT counselors (McDermott, Tyndall, & Lichtenberg, 1989). This may indicate that LGBT individuals fear that heterosexual counselors would misunderstand or, worse, actively discriminate against them based on their sexual identities.\nThe data on treatment programs that specifically target LGBT individuals are limited. At present, only two peer- reviewed published studies investigated changes in substance abuse among LGBT individuals in treatment programs that target LGBT individuals (Driscoll, 1982; Paul, Barrett, Crosby, & Stall, 1996). Driscoll (1982) investigated alcohol use among gay male individuals seeking treatment at a gay- identified agency in Boston. She found an abstinence rate over a 3-month period of 71% for individuals who had ended treatment at least 4 months previously. She concluded that the treatment agency was achieving high levels of success with its target population; however, there was no comparison group in the study.\nPaul et al. (1996) conducted a longitudinal study on 321 male alcohol and other substance users at a gay treatment agency in San Francisco. Baseline use of alcohol was 95% in the 90 days before treatment, with subjects reporting use, on average, for more than half of the 90 days. Polydrug use was also common. Sixty-seven percent of subjects self-identified as being drug-abusing or drug- addicted individuals (most commonly marijuana, amphet- amines, and inhalants). At a 3-month follow-up assessment,\nalcohol and other drug use declined by approximately half. Only 59% of the sample reported use of any substance at this point. The remaining assessment points did not indicate much further change beyond that which occurred in the first 3 months of treatment. As with the Driscoll (1982) study, the researchers were unable to compare these effects with individuals in programs that were not gay identified, although they emphasized substantial change in their high- risk sample.\nSignificant client improvement in the Driscoll (1982) and Paul et al. (1996) studies may indicate that programs specifically designed to provide a treatment environment that is free of homophobic bias are of most benefit to LGBT clients. If this is correct, for the general treatment clinics that exist, then research on the baseline levels of homophobia and heterosexist bias among providers will guide the development of more effective interventions in the future.\nThe present study examines several aspects of the experience of LGBT individuals in substance abuse treat- ment. It extends previous research in several ways: women are included in this project, whereas most previous studies have been with men only, and a group of heterosexual individuals receiving services through other publicly funded programs is provided for comparison. It also identifies, in a treatment-seeking sample, specific characteristics of LGBT individuals that may be addressed in treatment for SUDs. Finally, analyses are conducted separately by sex to determine if LGBT individuals differ on key variables from their heterosexual peers.\nBased on the prevailing data that indicate greater comorbidity and psychosocial problems among LGBT substance users, it was hypothesized that LGBT clients will present to chemical dependence treatment with greater severity of substance use and psychiatric problems than heterosexual clients. Specifically, the hypotheses of this study were that (1) LGBT clients will report more frequent abuse of substances at baseline than heterosexual clients and earlier age of onset of abuse and (2) LGBT clients will receive more psychiatric treatments than heterosexual clients. It was also hypothesized that increased difficulties among LGBT individuals will be evident in psychosocial characteristics, such as homelessness, experiences of domestic violence, and medical service utilization.\n2. Materials and methods\n2.1. Participants\nTo determine baseline differences between LGBT and heterosexual clients in treatment, we used a large database containing characteristics of state-funded clients. Individu- als receiving publicly funded chemical dependence treat- ment were the targets of analysis. Inclusion criteria for clients in the study were that they must participate in an outpatient substance abuse treatment program, be at least\nB.N. Cochran, A.M. Cauce / Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment 30 (2006) 135\xe2\x80\x93146 139\n18 years old, and be recipients of either state-funded or federally funded substance abuse treatment (data are collected by the state only for publicly funded chemically dependent clients). Beginning July 1, 2001, the data collected by Washington State included information about the sexual orientation of clients in treatment owing to a change in policy that requested inclusion of these data. Notably, Washington is the first state to request information about the sexual orientation of its clients seeking chemical dependence treatment services. Sexual orientation data were required for all clients beginning October 1, 2001, although clients retained the option of indicating that they preferred not to answer this question.\nBased on the timeline for inclusion of the sexual ori- entation question in the state- maintained database, data were collected for participants who began treatment on or after July 1, 2001. The data were collected for 18 months (through December 31, 2002). Participants who had enrolled in treatment during the study timeline but had not yet completed treatment were included in the analyses of baseline data.\nA total of 24,792 clients comprised the sample for the study. The mean age of the participants at admission was 35.09 years (SD = 10.40 years). Most of the participants were male (n = 15,571, 62.81%); 9,221 clients (37.19%) were female. [Despite being asked if they identified as transgender in the section on sexual orientation, the options for client gender were dichotomous.] Most of the clients in the study lived in their own residences (80.56%), followed by drug-free shared housing or transitional housing (4.21%), homeless shelters or missions (3.66%), and jail or prison (3.15%). For the purposes of analysis, clients living in homeless shelters, those who did on the streets, and those who indicated that they had no stable housing arrangement (n = 1,607, 6.48%) were combined to comprise the homeless subsample.\nIn terms of ethnicity, 70.94% of the sample identified as Caucasian, 10.50% as Latin American, 7.95% as American Indian or Alaskan Native, 7.51% as African American, and 1.83% as Asian American. The remaining participants either selected being of botherQ ethnicity or refused to answer or data were not collected.\nSexual orientation data were complete for 17,592 participants (70.96% of total sample); a complete break- down of the data is shown in Table 1. As noted, data regarding sexual orientation were not required during the first 3 months of the enrollment period; thus, not all clients\xe2\x80\x99 sexual orientations were available for analysis. For the purposes of this study, all clients identifying as gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, or questioning (n = 610, 2.46%) were classified as LGBT individuals. The remaining 15,705 individuals who identified as heterosexual (63.35%) served as a comparison group, excluding participants who chose not to disclose their sexual orientation (n = 1,071, 4.32%) or for whom the data were not collected (n = 206, 0.83%). Because the variable of sexual orientation was obtained by self-report and because of the stigma surrounding LGBT\nTable 1\nParticipants\xe2\x80\x99 self-reported sexual orientation and gender identity (subsample n = 17,386)\n Heterosexual Female Male\nGay or lesbian Female\nMale\nBisexual Female Male\nQuestioning Female Male\nTransgender Female Male\nChoosing not to disclose Female\nMale\nValues are expressed as n (%).\n15,705 (90.33) 5,634 (32.41) 10,071 (57.93) 302 (1.74) 130 (0.75) 172 (0.99) 269 (1.55) 192 (1.10)\n77 (0.44) 32 (0.18) 16 (0.09) 16 (0.09)\n7 (0.04) 3 (0.02) 4 (0.02)\n1,071 (6.16) 459 (2.64) 612 (3.52)\n identity, the validity of the sexual orientation variable (particularly for those identifying as heterosexual) may be questionable. Resultant implications for the present study are discussed further in the Discussion section.\nThe study data represented 212 treatment agencies in Washington State; the mean number of clients per agency was 116.94 (range = 1\xe2\x80\x93816 clients per agency). In the state of Washington at the time of this study, only one chemical dependence treatment agency specifically identified its main mission as serving the LGBT community; this agency had 177 clients (0.71% of the total sample or 29.02% of the LGBT subsample) to enter treatment during the study enrollment period.\n2.2. Measures\nIn Washington State, clients receiving publicly funded treatment for chemical dependence are tracked through the Treatment and Assessment Report Generation Tool (TARGET) database. This database, which is managed by the Division of Alcohol and Substance Abuse (DASA) of the Department of Social and Health Services, provides the most comprehensive data collected for individuals complet- ing substance abuse treatment in the state.\nThe data collected for the TARGET database are obtained via therapist (or intake assessor) interviews with their clients. As all of the same data are collected for each client, the forms for data collection have the format of a semistructured interview. Assessments are administered at three intervals: initial assessment, admission to treatment, and discharge (for clients who drop out, some discharge data are provided by the therapists if they have information about the clients\xe2\x80\x99 current status after discharge). Clients are asked about their living arrangements, educational background, employment, physical health, mental status, and legal involvement. All areas are assessed in terms of current\n140 B.N. Cochran, A.M. Cauce / Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment 30 (2006) 135\xe2\x80\x93146\nfunctioning. In addition, clients are asked about their substance use for their top three substances of choice. They are asked to give their age of first use, frequency of use in the past 30 days, and the date of last use (along with the amount taken on that date) for each substance.\nFor the purposes of this study, the following data were obtained from the TARGET database: (1) client-reported sexual orientation, (2) demographic data, (3) frequency of use for the three drugs of choice, (4) psychiatric services received, and (5) medical service utilization. Client partic- ipants and treatment counselors were not directly inter- viewed. Disclosure of treatment records through the DASA was permitted for the purposes of this study. The data were obtained for the period beginning with the addition of the client sexual orientation question to the assessment (July 1, 2001) until December 31, 2002.\n2.3. Data collection\nAll relevant data files were released to study personnel after the enrollment period of the study. As the TARGET database is updated daily, it is expected that the study sample represents all individuals receiving treatment for whom data were collected. Data were checked for logistic errors (e.g., implausible admission dates that had not yet occurred); in the few cases in which errors were found, the errors were discussed with TARGET database management personnel and adjustments were made to the data set.\n2.4. Analytic strategy\nTo investigate the key hypotheses of this study, we ran multiple analyses on the same sample of participants. Because these analyses were across different domains of functioning (e.g., substance use, psychological functioning, treatment completion), adjustments to the a level were not made to correct for multiple tests. However, results for these analyses are presented with the full range of observed p values so that the degree to which each test is significant is apparent to the reader.\nAll analyses were conducted using two-tailed tests of significance. Despite having some directional hypotheses, the use of two-tailed tests allowed for the possibility that differences occurring in the unexpected direction would still be detected by the analyses. Missing data were handled by excluding cases if the missing variables were part of the specific analysis being conducted.\n3. Results\n3.1. Baseline differences between LGBT and heterosexual clients\nOne of the key hypotheses of this study was that participants who identified as LGBT individuals would\nhave greater rates of substance use and more psychopathol- ogy at baseline as compared with those who identified as heterosexuals. This hypothesis was partially supported in multiple domains.\n3.2. Substance use\nTable 2 shows the primary substance of abuse for heterosexual and openly LGBT clients. For both groups, the primary drug of abuse for which participants sought treatment was alcohol. Numerous drug categories were infrequently endorsed as the primary drug of abuse and were classified into an botherQ category. These include amphet- amines, hallucinogens, inhalants, over-the-counter drugs, major tranquilizers, PCP, benzodiazepines, prescribed opiate substitutes, other opiates or synthetics, and other sedatives or hypnotics. m2 Tests of differences in proportions were conducted to determine the significance of differences between openly LGBT and heterosexual clients. Group differences appear in several drug categories: heterosexual individuals are more likely to endorse alcohol as a primary drug of abuse than LGBT individuals. In contrast, LGBT individuals are more likely to abuse methamphetamine or cocaine or crack than heterosexual individuals.\nThe proportions of individuals in each group who smoke cigarettes were also compared; openly LGBT individuals were proportionately more likely than heterosexual individ- uals to be smokers (78.64% vs. 72.95%, respectively, m2 = 9.29, p b .01).\nFrequency of substance use was also a focus of an- alyses. Because inconsistent periods had been used during different stages of data collection (e.g., the frequency of use variable was coded as b1 to 3 times in the past 30 daysQ in some instances and b1 to 2 times per weekQ in others), the frequency data options were averaged so that the midpoint represented the number of days a substance was used in the past 30 days (e.g., b3 to 6 times per weekQ was recorded as 4.5 times per week, which is approximately 19.3 of the past 30 days). Analyses were performed on the transformed variable to determine if group differences existed in the number of days clients had used their primary substance out of the previous 30 days. Results indicated that openly LGBT clients used their primary substance of abuse more frequently\nTable 2\nPrimary substance of abuse by sexual orientation and gender\n Primary substance of abuse\nAlcohol Marijuana Methamphetamine Heroin\nCocaine or crack Other\nHeterosexual clients [n (%)]\n7,915 (50.40) 2,114 (13.46) 2,137 (13.61) 1,775 (11.30) 1,153 (7.34)\n611 (3.89)\nLGBT\nclients [n (%)]\n223 (36.56) 81 (13.28) 131 (21.48) 83 (13.61)\n60 (9.84) 32 (5.25)\nm2(1) difference between groups\n44.44 ( p b .001) 0.005\n29.72 ( p b .001) 2.87\n4.95 ( p b .05) 2.50\n    \nB.N.

The groups did not differ, however, on age at which the primary substance was first used, LGBT M = 17.56, heterosexual M = 17.45, t(10, 812) = .34, p = ns.\n3.3. Psychopathology\nAs the data in TARGET do not contain specific diagnostic information, variables used as a proxy for psychological well-being were whether clients had pre- vious treatment for mental health problems, current treatment for these problems, a history of mental health hospitalizations, and a current prescription for psycho- tropic medications.\nResults indicated significant differences in all of these domains, with openly LGBT clients using more mental health services than heterosexual clients. Previous mental health treatment was defined as having had either inpatient or outpatient treatment for mental health issues (other than substance abuse) in the past year; participants were coded as having treatment if they had at least four sessions with a mental health professional or had been administered psychiatric medications for a minimum of 30 consecutive days or if they had been hospitalized for psychiatric reasons. This treatment had been obtained by 39.20% of openly LGBT clients and by 20.06% of heterosexual clients (n = 234 and 3,083, respectively, m2 = 126.63, p b .0001). Current mental health treatment or perceived need for such treatment also differed across groups. Because participants were receiving publicly funded treat- ment for SUDs and were likely to have limited financial resources, we considered participants\xe2\x80\x99 self-report that they were bin need of treatmentQ for mental health problems as valid as if they were actually receiving such treatment. On average, 48.12% of openly LGBT clients were currently receiving mental health treatment or stated that they were bin need of treatment,Q compared with 21.75% of hetero- sexual clients (n = 281 and 3,191, respectively, m2 = 220.49, p b .0001). When clients were selected on the basis of whether they had been hospitalized for mental health reasons in the past year, differences between groups were also statistically significant. There were 56 openly LGBT clients (9.38%) who had been hospitalized, com- pared with 809 heterosexual clients (5.26%, m2 = 18.20, p b .0001). With regard to psychotropic medications, 235 (40.66%) openly LGBT clients were currently taking medications, more than twice the proportion of hetero- sexual clients (n = 2,936, 20.29%). Although all of these analyses were conducted in similar areas of functioning and some of the data may be redundant (i.e., clients receiving current mental health treatment were also more likely to have had a treatment episode in the past year), the observed p values would remain significant at the .001 level after adjusting for possible a inflation.\n3.4. Psychosocial characteristics\nIt was hypothesized that in addition to differences in substance abuse and mental health problems, other psycho- social difficulties would indicate greater distress among openly LGBT clients. Specifically, the areas of functioning assessed were homelessness, current legal issues, domestic violence history, and physical health problems.\nIn the study sample, 11.31% of openly LGBT clients were currently homeless, compared with 7.01% of hetero- sexual clients (n = 69 and 1,101, respectively, m2 = 15.68, p b .0001).\nCurrent legal issues were defined as the presence or absence of involvement with the criminal justice system; 68.73% of the entire sample had some current legal involvement. The most frequently cited legal issues were being on probation or parole (36.01%), awaiting trial (8.86%), being in a supervised program (4.17%), being in drug court (3.32%), awaiting charges (2.68%), and being incarcerated postconviction (2.41%). In terms of group differences, 53.49% of LGBT clients had some legal involvement, as compared with 69.32% of heterosexual clients. This difference was statistically significant in the opposite direction hypothesized: openly LGBT clients were less likely to interface with the criminal justice system (m2 = 66.90, p b .0001).\nDomestic violence was defined as having been the victim of physical harm, bodily injury, assault, or the infliction of fear regarding these behaviors between family or household members or as being sexually assaulted by a family or household member. Current domestic violence was defined as having been victimized within the past 30 days; past domestic violence included all lifetime experiences. Partic- ipants had the option of indicating that they were bunsureQ if they had been victimized. Relatively few clients in the study indicated that they were uncertain about current (0.76% of 14,181 participants answering this question) or past (1.21% of 15,076 participants answering) domestic violence, and these participants were excluded from analysis. Of the openly LGBT subsample, 4.41% (n = 25) were current victims of domestic violence, compared with 2.86% (n = 390) of the heterosexual population; this difference was statistically significant (m2 = 4.03, p = .04). Past domestic violence was more common in both groups; 54.71% of openly LGBT participants (n = 325) had experienced domestic violence at some point in the past, compared with 36.19% of the heterosexual population (n = 5,241, difference m2 = 83.02, p b .0001).\nData were collected regarding current utilization of services for physical health reasons. Specifically, partic- ipants were asked about their total number of medical outpatient or clinical visits, medical inpatient admissions, total number of medical inpatient days, and emergency department visits in the past year. Table 3 shows the group differences on these variables as a function of sexual orientation.\n142 B.N. Cochran, A.M.

Sex differences in key dependent variables\nIt is possible that combining all 610 LGBT participants in the same group may have obscured meaningful differ- ences that exist within the LGBT subsample. Accordingly, we split the entire sample based on sex and subsequently conducted analyses of LGBT versus heterosexual individ- uals on the key variables of interest in this study. Because the literature in this area has not typically reported separate results for gay, bisexual, and transgender men and lesbian, bisexual, and transgender women, we considered these analyses to be exploratory and therefore did not have specific a priori hypotheses regarding the pattern of results.\nIn terms of the primary problem substance, comparisons between heterosexual men and gay, bisexual, and trans- gender men were conducted using m2 tests for each category\nof substance (see Fig. 1 for results by gender). Significant differences between heterosexual men and gay, bisexual, and transgender men emerged for several substance categories: (1) heterosexual men were more likely to endorse problems with alcohol or heroin than gay, bisexual, and transgender men and (2) gay, bisexual, and transgender men were more likely to endorse methamphetamine or botherQ drug use. (Because of the small sample size in this category, it was not possible to separate out specific drugs in this category for analysis.) Comparisons of heterosexual women and lesbian, bisexual, and transgender women yielded a different pattern of results: whereas heterosexual women were more likely to endorse alcohol as a primary substance, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender women were more likely to endorse use of heroin.\nFrequency of use of the primary substance of abuse was used in these analyses as a measure of the severity of substance use problems. Gay, bisexual, and transgender men were more likely to endorse higher frequency of use when they entered treatment than heterosexual men, gay, bisexual, and transgender M = 3.19, heterosexual M = 2.76, t(10, 239) = 3.03, p b .01. Lesbian, bisexual, and transgender\n Fig. 1. Primary substance of abuse by gender and self-reported sexual orientation.\nB.N. Cochran, A.M. Cauce / Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment 30 (2006) 135\xe2\x80\x93146 143\nwomen also endorsed a higher frequency of use of the primary problem substance, lesbian, bisexual, and trans- gender M = 3.27, heterosexual M = 2.86, t(5910) = 3.01, p b .01. Analyses of the mean frequency of use of secondary and tertiary problem substances indicated no significant difference for either men or women when comparing LGBT with heterosexual participants.\nWe also reanalyzed the data regarding psychopathology (previous and current mental health treatment, previous mental health hospitalization, and current prescription for psychotropic medications) separately for each sex, again comparing heterosexual and LGBT participants. All of these variables were significantly different before stratifying analyses by sex, and all of them remained significant when analyzed separately by sex with one exception: the finding of elevated rates of psychiatric hospitalization remained significant only for men (10.23% gay, bisexual, and transgender men were hospitalized as compared with 4.40% of heterosexual men, m2 = 20.10, p b .001). For women, rates did not differ based on sexual orientation status (8.71% of lesbian, bisexual, and transgender women and 6.82% of heterosexual women were hospitalized, m2 = 1.74, p = ns).\nFor the next set of analyses stratified by sex, we analyzed whether group differences existed between heterosexual and LGBT individuals in homelessness, legal issues, and domestic violence experiences. Because all of these variables had significant between-group differences for the entire sample, only significant differences that remained after conducting analyses separately by sex are reported. Gay, bisexual, and transgender men were almost twice as likely as heterosexual men to be homeless (14.49% vs. 7.34%, respectively, m2 = 19.31, p b .001). When we reanalyzed the data regarding legal issues, significant differences remained for men (46.21% of gay, bisexual, and transgender men vs. 73.49% of heterosexual men reported current legal problems, m2 = 96.57, p b .001) but not for women based on LGBT status. Analyses regarding domestic violence yielded no significant difference between groups for current domestic violence but did yield signifi- cant differences between gay, bisexual, and transgender men and heterosexual men only for past domestic violence (38.31% of gay, bisexual, and transgender men endorsed previous domestic violence as compared with 18.76% of heterosexual men, m2 = 62.07, p b .001).\nFinally, analyses of medical service utilization were stratified by sex, and heterosexual and LGBT participants were compared using a series of t tests. As Table 3 indicates, significant differences existed for outpatient medical visits and emergency department visits before stratifying the analyses. For women, there was no significant difference on these four variables between heterosexual and LGBT individuals. However, for men, all four of these variables were significantly different, with gay, bisexual, and transgender men endorsing greater utilization than heterosexual men of outpatient visits,\ninpatient admissions, inpatient medical days, and emer- gency department visits (all p b .01).\n4. Discussion\nThe hypotheses of baseline group differences between heterosexual and LGBT clients were partially supported: openly LGBT clients entered treatment with greater fre- quency of substance use, a history of more mental health treatments, higher rates of homelessness, a greater like- lihood of being victims of domestic violence, and more treatments for physical problems than heterosexual clients. However, openly LGBT clients were less likely to have current involvement with the criminal justice system. Generally, these results point to a specific subset of the population who may be targeted for intensive substance abuse services. Indeed, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration [SAMHSA] (2001) pub- lished a guide to the treatment of LGBT substance users based on the belief that intensified services are needed for this population. The current study validates this need.\nWhen analyses were conducted separately by sex, an interesting pattern emerged: the primary problem substances differed from men to women as a function of sexual orientation status. Although alcohol was still the primary problem endorsed by most participants, LGBT individuals (overall) were less likely to endorse alcohol as a primary substance than were heterosexual individuals. Correspond- ingly, other substances of abuse were more frequently endorsed among gay, bisexual, and transgender men (methamphetamine and botherQ substances) and among lesbian, bisexual, and transgender women (heroin). Notably, use of these highly addictive drugs may place LGBT individuals at greater risk for severe substance use problems; one indicator of this, greater frequency of use at baseline, was found in the present study.\nSex-stratified analyses also further elucidated the nature of differences between LGBT and heterosexual individuals for measures of psychopathology, psychosocial character- istics, and medical service utilization. Although differences remained significant when comparing lesbian, bisexual, and transgender women and heterosexual women on many of these variables, in several cases (previous mental health hospitalization, current homelessness, current legal issues, past domestic violence, medical service utilization), signifi- cant differences as a function of LGBT status were found for men only. With the exception of legal issues (gay, bisexual, and transgender men were less likely than heterosexual men to endorse legal problems), these differences all indicated greater severity of problems for gay, bisexual, and trans- gender men. It is possible that these problems are related to more frequent endorsement of methamphetamine use for this group; however, because these findings are correla- tional, the reasons for elevated problems among gay, bisexual, and transgender men are unclear.\n144 B.N. Cochran, A.M. Cauce / Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment 30 (2006) 135\xe2\x80\x93146\nAlthough these findings cannot resolve the question of why LGBT individuals might abuse substances, the results point to a pattern of more severe problems among openly LGBT clients than among heterosexual clients. Coping with a stigmatized sexual identity, dealing with the stressors of being in a minority group, and internalizing negative feelings toward the self are possible explanations that exist in the literature. Future studies examining the specific factors involved in LGBT substance use are needed. For example, detailed interviews with this population could provide more information about pathways of initiation into substance use, triggers for episodes of use, and difficulties associated with decreasing or stopping use. Clearly, openly LGBT clients represent a distinct subset of the treatment- seeking population whose difficulties transcend those of most heterosexual clients; however, at this point, the exact reasons underlying this increased risk are unclear.\nThere are several implications of this study\xe2\x80\x99s findings for providers working with clients who have SUDs. Many of these suggestions are drawn from the provider\xe2\x80\x99s guide published by the SAMHSA (2001) and are extended in light of this study\xe2\x80\x99s results. First, it is important to ask about clients\xe2\x80\x99 sexual identities, attractions, and behaviors. The prevailing assumption of heterosexuality in society may lead providers to overlook aspects of sexuality that may be related to a client\xe2\x80\x99s substance use. Second, providers must work to be aware of their own heterosexist assumptions and homophobia to avoid perpetuating an atmosphere of discrimination that may have contributed to a client\xe2\x80\x99s alcohol or drug use. Continuing education programs that focus on treating LGBT clients and consultation with providers who are experienced in working with LGBT clients are ways that counselors may further their knowledge in this area. Third, providers must respect their clients\xe2\x80\x99 sexual identities and behaviors, even if they are in conflict with their own values. This nonjudgmental stance is consistent with the current emphasis on acceptance in psychotherapy for SUDs (Hayes et al., 2004; Linehan et al., 1999). Finally, when openly LGBT individuals enter treatment at an agency, counselors should inquire about the relationship between the clients\xe2\x80\x99 sexual or gender identity and substance use problems. Questions that may tap into this relationship include bhow did your drinking or drug use change during the process of coming out to friends and family?Q; bhow often do your sexual encounters involve alcohol or drug use?Q; and bdo you ever drink or use drugs to cope with the discrimination that you experience as a sexual minority?Q\nIn a recent study by Olmstead and Sindelar (2004), substance use treatment programs that reported having specialized programs for gay men and lesbians were examined to see if they provided HIV testing and counseling as a bkey serviceQ for this population. Such services are certainly important components of a program, but there are many other ways that an agency can assist LGBT individuals with substance use problems. Agencies can\ncommunicate that they provide a supportive atmosphere for LGBT clients through including bserving LGBT clientsQ in their mission statement, by establishing contacts within the LGBT community, by providing specialized groups or programs for LGBT substance users, and by using inclusive language in all forms and clinical materials. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender clients may benefit by participat- ing in programs that acknowledge the likelihood that societal stigma contributes to their substance use. For example, groups in which LGBT clients could discuss their unique experiences in combating societal homophobia with one another may be an important additional component to addictions treatment. Programs tailored to treating LGBT clients should be prepared to address comorbid psycholog- ical problems and psychosocial stressors that may surpass those of heterosexual clients. In summary, providing effective treatment for LGBT substance users may require agency changes at both the administrative and the individual staff level.\nBecause a different pattern of results was found for men and for women in this study, treatment providers may use these findings to target specific groups of LGBT individuals for treatment. For lesbian, bisexual, and transgender women, elevated rates of heroin use may indicate a need to tailor treatment to the specific needs of heroin-using LGBT individuals. For example, outreach programs for lesbian, bisexual, and transgender women who use heroin or treatment programs that address heroin use in an LGBT- sensitive context may improve services for this population.\nIn terms of the results regarding gay, bisexual, and transgender men in this study, the need for methamphet- amine treatment programs targeting gay, bisexual, and transgender men was validated by our findings. The analyses indicated significant differences between gay, bisexual, and transgender men and heterosexual men in terms of psychopathology, problems in living (homelessness and domestic violence history), and medical service needs. Correspondingly, because fewer gay, bisexual, and trans- gender men had legal issues at the time of treatment entry, they may represent those who have come to treatment of their own accord as a result of experiencing numerous psychosocial problems. Targeting these individuals may require dual-diagnosis programs to address issues specific to gay, bisexual, and transgender men; for example, assessing for trauma subsequent to domestic violence experiences may be an important component of treating this population. Further research may continue to identify subgroups within the overarching bLGBTQ category with specific needs. Although at this point the data indicate that LGBT individuals face a greater risk for substance abuse problems, heterogeneity among those with a sexual orientation or gender identity that differs from the majority culture may indicate unique needs that can only be discovered by studying subgroups that exist in LGBT communities.\nThe generalizability of these findings is an improvement over previous studies, as participants were not selected for\nB.N. Cochran, A.M. Cauce / Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment 30 (2006) 135\xe2\x80\x93146 145\nsexual orientation but instead were part of a general treatment-seeking population. However, the identification of LGBT individuals remains a difficult sampling issue. There are several characteristics of this study sample that exemplify this issue: first, only a small proportion of the sample (2.46%) self-identified as LGBT individuals. Because this sample was drawn from a large database, we were able to conduct inferential statistics. However, the proportion of the client population identifying as LGBT is smaller than would be expected if the speculations about increased risk among LGBT individuals are accurate. Second, 29.87% of the participants did not have data regarding their sexual orientation and 6.16% of those who were asked chose not to disclose this information. Because these data rely on both counselors\xe2\x80\x99 comfort with asking this question and participants\xe2\x80\x99 willingness to be open about their sexual orientation, a large number of LGBT clients may have been unidentified in this study. Indeed, disclosure of LGBT status in a new situation, to a counselor who is reporting these data to the state, may minimize the likelihood of accurate reporting. Third, clients who do disclose their LGBT identity to a counselor may differ from other LGBT clients in their vulnerability to shame or other factors theorized to underlie the addiction process. Differ- ences may occur in either direction, although intuitively, it seems more likely that clients who are reluctant to disclose their LGBT identities may also have high levels of shame that could trigger affect-induced substance use.\nBecause data on LGBT identity for this study relied on self-report, findings should be interpreted with caution. The exact proportion of LGBT individuals in the population is unknown; however, Michaels (1996) provided the most comprehensive review of the literature to date. According to this review, 9.8% of males and 5% of females report same- sex sexual behavior since puberty, 7.7% of males and 7.5% of females report same-sex sexual desire, and 2.8% of males and 1.8% of females report a gay, lesbian, or bisexual identity. As noted earlier, the proportion of LGBT individ- uals in treatment for SUDs could be expected to be higher than these estimates as SUDs are estimated to be higher among LGBT individuals than among heterosexual ones. The openly LGBT subsample in this study, 2.46% of the entire sample, is probably lower than the actual proportion of individuals who have experienced same-sex sexual behavior or desire. Correspondingly, some of the partic- ipants who identified as heterosexuals may have had histories of same-sex sexual activity or attractions. This potential discrepancy points to an important consideration for future research; in addition to asking about LGBT identity, questions about same-sex attraction and experi- ences might better identify individuals at elevated risk for SUDs. Still, cultural prohibitions and sex-role expectations may perpetuate the gulf between sexual identity and behavior. For example, Mays, Cochran, and Zamudio (2004) described how social inequalities and stigma have contributed to the epidemic of HIV infection among African\nAmerican men. Some of these men who engage in high- risk sexual behavior with other men on the bdown lowQ are less likely to disclose their sexual orientations and therefore may be missed by prevention or intervention efforts that inquire about self-reported sexual identity but not behavior. Therefore, it is necessary to look beyond self- report of sexual identity and to inquire about specific behaviors that may place individuals at elevated risk for negative health outcomes to further identify the specific needs of LGBT individuals.\nThere are several limitations of this study that should be noted: the lack of random assignment to treatment agencies may have influenced differences in outcome, the population investigated was only of publicly funded clients, and data relied on participants\xe2\x80\x99 self-report and recall abilities. These potential factors complicate the aforementioned problems with the reporting of sexual orientation in a TARGET interview. However, these limitations are tempered by the fact that this is the first study to provide comparisons of treatment-seeking LGBT and heterosexual clients using a standardized measure.\nDespite a relatively small percentage of LGBT clients being represented in the TARGET database, this study provides one of the most comprehensive views of LGBT individuals in substance abuse treatment that is available in the literature. From the data obtained, it is apparent that openly LGBT clients enter treatment with greater severity of substance abuse and other psychological problems and face greater psychosocial challenges than heterosexual clients. This study also identified specific sex differ- ences in the pattern of results, with resulting implications for tailoring treatment to the needs of a heterogeneous LGBT population.\nChemically dependent clients are, arguably, among the most difficult group of clients to treat. Advances in the field have largely relied on designing and testing new interven- tions; however, it is unclear whether these treatments work equally well across all types of clients. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals who enter treatment with more severe substance abuse problems than heterosexual ones may benefit from intensified groups or programs that are designed to incorporate their LGBT identity into the treatment process. Concurrently, more research are needed to identify ways that the needs of LGBT substance users may be addressed. An improved understanding of the factors related to providing high-quality substance abuse treatment to all individuals will help us address the major public health problem of chemical dependence.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by a grant from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (1F31DA014158-01A1).\nWe thank the Washington State DASA for assisting with this project.\n146 B.N.

aS'\nSexual Harassment Victimization and Perpetration Among High School Students\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nThis large, population-based study is one of the few to examine prevalence rates\nof sexual harassment occurring during the past 12 months by victimization and\nperpetration among adolescents. In this large, cross-sectional survey of students\nattending 26 high schools, sexual harassment was defined using three questions\nfrom the Sexual Experiences Questionnaire. Among 18,090 students completing the\nsurvey, 30% disclosed sexual harassment victimization (37% of females, 21% of males)\nand 8.5% reported perpetration (5% of females, 12% of males). Sexual harassment\nperpetration was highly correlated with male sex, minority race/ethnicity, same-sex\nattraction, bullying, alcohol binge drinking, and intraparental partner violence.\nKeywords\nadolescents, high school, perpetration, sexual harassment, victimization\nAlthough sexual harassment has often been associated with the adult workplace environment,\na shift toward exploring rates in high school-aged adolescents has emerged\n(Fineran & Bennett, 1999; Fineran & Bolen, 2006; Hill, Kearl, & American Association\n1University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, USA\n2University of Cincinnati, OH, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nEmily R. Clear, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, A. B. Chandler Medical Center, University of\nKentucky, 800 Rose Street, C347, Lexington, KY 40536-0293, USA.\nEmail: Emily.Clear@uky.edu\n551287 VAWXXX10.1177/1077801214551287Clear et al.Violence Against Women\nresearch-article2014\n1204 Violence Against Women 20(10)\nof University Women, 2011). Sexual harassment as it relates to the school environment\nis defined as conduct that is sexual in nature, unwelcome, denies or limits a student\xe2\x80\x99s\nability to participate in or benefit from a school\xe2\x80\x99s education program, and\ninterferes with a student\xe2\x80\x99s right to a supportive, respectful, and safe learning environment\n(U.S. Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights, 2008; Witkowska &\nKjellberg, 2005). School-based definitions also address unwanted sexual behavior that\ninterferes with a student\xe2\x80\x99s educational opportunities, which may not be face-to-face,\nincluding cyberbullying through text messages and other social media (Hill et al.,\n2011).\nIt is worth noting the difference between bullying and sexual harassment. Unlike\nbullying behaviors, sexual harassment incorporates a strong sexual component with\nlittle to no physical contact. Sexual harassment is an illegal form of sex discrimination\nthat violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (U.S. Equal Employment\nOpportunity Commission, 2009) and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972\n(U.S. Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights, 1997). When bullying is used\nto describe sexual harassment, it takes away the role of gender and sex, which are key\nparts of the definition (Stein & Mennemeier, 2011). Nansel and colleagues used a definition\nthat addressed the three components used in bullying definitions among\nresearchers:\nBullying is a specific type of aggression in which (1) the behavior is intended to harm or\ndisturb, (2) the behavior occurs repeatedly over time, (3) there is an imbalance of power\n(physical or psychological), with a more powerful person or group attacking a less\npowerful one. (Nansel et al., 2001, p. 2094; Salmivalli, Kaukiainen, Kaistaniemi, &\nLagerspetz, 1999; Swearer & Espelage, 2011)\nSexual harassment could be viewed as a form of non-physical aggression on a continuum\nwith sexual violence (Basile & Saltzman, 2002); thus, understanding correlates\nof sexual harassment victimization, and particularly perpetration, could be very\nimportant for sexual and dating violence prevention.\nA review of research shows estimated rates of sexual harassment among students to\nbe between 23% and 87% (Attar-Schwartz, 2009; Fineran & Bennett, 1999; Harris &\nAssociates, 1993; Hill et al., 2011; Langelan, 1993; Lipson & American Association of\nUniversity Women Educational Foundation, 2001; Martin, 2008; McMaster, Connolly,\nPepler, & Craig, 2002; Ormerod, Collinsworth, & Perry, 2008; Permanent Commission\non the Status of Women [PCSW], 1995; Stein, Marshall, & Tropp 1993; Strauss &\nEspeland, 1992). Variance in rates may be attributed to differences in the methodology\nfor identifying the sample, study power, and the operational definition of sexual\nharassment. In a small study of 21 female students attending an alternative high school,\nresearchers found that 52% disclosed sexual harassment (Martin, 2008), whereas in a\nmuch larger study of 16,604 Israeli students in Grades 7 to 11, 26% reported at least\none incident of sexual harassment (Attar-Schwartz, 2009). In a more recent study of\nstudents in Grades 7 to 12, approximately half (48%) experienced some form of sexual\nharassment in the 2010-2011 school year (Hill et al., 2011). Prior research indicated \nClear et al. 1205\nthat females were more likely than males to be sexually harassed (Hill et al., 2011;\nLipson & American Association of University Women Educational Foundation, 2001;\nOrmerod et al., 2008; Sagrestano, 2009), and males were identified as perpetrators in\nmore than 90% of the incidents of sexual harassment against females (Fineran &\nBennett, 1999; Harris & Associates, 1993; Langelan, 1993; McMaster et al., 2002;\nPCSW, 1995; Robers, Zhang, Truman, Department of Justice, & National Center for\nEducation Statistics, 2012; Stein et al., 1993; Strauss & Espeland, 1992).\nThe limited research that has addressed the prevalence and health impact of sexual\nharassment victimization indicated that among adolescents, females were psychologically\nmore affected by sexual harassment, had lower self-esteem, admitted to taking\nsexual harassment more personally, were victims of repeated sexual harassment, and\nwere more likely to attempt suicide than males (Bagley, Bolitho, & Bertrand, 1997;\nChiodo, Wolfe, Crooks, Hughes, & Jaffe, 2009; Gadin & Hammarstrom, 2005).\nMultiple studies have reported students feeling angry, upset, and threatened by sexual\nharassment, which contributed to lower self-esteem and confidence (Harris &\nAssociates, 1993; PCSW, 1995; Stein et al., 1993; Strauss & Espeland, 1992).\nIn addition to its effects on mental health, sexual harassment has consequences for\nstudents\xe2\x80\x99 school performance, specifically poor grades, absenteeism, skipping or dropping\nclasses, and poor school performance (Corbett & Gentry, 1993; Hand & Sanchez,\n2000; Harris & Associates, 1993, 1993; Lee, Croninger, Linn, & Chen, 1996; Lipson\n& American Association of University Women Educational Foundation, 2001; Robers\net al., 2012). Collectively, these findings indicate a need to more comprehensively\ndocument gender differences in sexual harassment victimization and perpetration and\nto identify other demographic or social factors associated with increased risk of sexual\nharassment.\nThe purpose of the present study was to add to the limited research available on\nsexual harassment victimization and perpetration of high school students. We hypothesized\nthat females reported higher rates of victimization, and males disclosed higher\nrates of perpetration. Rates of sexual harassment by tactic, direction, and sex were\nreported, including the co-occurrence of victimization and perpetration in the past 12\nmonths. This research fills an important gap in the existing research by providing estimates\nof the frequency of sexual harassment victimization and perpetration among\nadolescents and by sex and other demographic and violence risk factors.\nMethod\nParticipants\nAll high school students (freshmen-seniors) attending 1 of 26 participating high\nschools and present during surveying were asked to complete a self-administered survey.\nThe survey was a 95-item anonymous paper-and-pencil questionnaire that took\napproximately 25 to 40 min to complete. Between January and May 2010, study personnel\ntraveled to the high schools and administered surveys either in a class administration\nsetting in the school during a selected class (for example, English classes for \n1206 Violence Against Women 20(10)\nthe whole day; n = 16), or a school group administration during which the whole\nschool was surveyed in one class period (for example, first period; n = 10). The model\nfor survey administration was familiar to schools, as it was used when conducting the\nYouth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,\n2009).\nAll parents and guardians of enrolled students were mailed an informational letter\ndescribing the study purpose and the types of questions to be included on the survey.\nIf parents or guardians did not wish for their student to participate in the survey, they\nwere asked to call or email with the name and school of their student. So as not to\nsingle these students out from other classmates, study staff worked with the teachers\nto identify students whose parents did not wish for them to participate on the day of\nadministration. Staff gave these students an identical survey booklet that did not contain\nany questions, but included the same face page and instructions as well as a\nScantron\xc2\xae form. Students whose parents or guardians did not grant permission for\nthem to participate were asked to bubble in the letter J for all answers on the Scantron\xc2\xae\nform so it would look as if they were participating.\nIn the classroom, all students were asked not to write their name or birth date on the\nScantron\xc2\xae forms. Elements of assent were read to all students by Collaborative\nInstitutional Training Initiative trained staff. If the methodology was a school-wide\none-period administration, a DVD with instructions was played for students. During\nthe all-day administrations, study staff read the assent information to each class period.\nAll students were directed to review the assent form in the survey booklet and decide\nfor themselves whether they wished to complete the survey. Those opting not to complete\nthe survey were asked to fill in the letter H on the Scantron\xc2\xae form and then\nquietly remain in their seat. All survey Scantron\xc2\xae forms were collected at the end of\nadministration. Resources, including websites and toll-free numbers for national agencies\navailable at all times to address domestic violence, sexual assaults, depression, or\nsuicide ideation, were provided at the end of survey booklets. These resources were\nalso given on pencils the students used to complete the survey and were able to keep.\nThe national hotlines and websites linked individuals to local services. The study protocol\nwas approved by the University of Kentucky Institutional Review Board\n09-0680-F1V.\nMeasures\nThree items based on the Sexual Experiences Questionnaire (SEQ) were used to measure\nperpetration and victimization of sexual harassment (Fitzgerald, Magley,\nDrasgow, & Waldo, 1999). Items asked specifically about victimization and perpetration\nusing the introduction of either, \xe2\x80\x9cIn the past 12 months, how many times did\nanother high school student . . .\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cIn the past 12 months, how many times did YOU\n. . .\xe2\x80\x9d Items included the following: (a) Tell you sexual stories or jokes that made you\nuneasy? (b) Make gestures, rude remarks or use sexual body language to embarrass or\nupset you? (c) Keep asking you out on a date or asking you to hookup although you\nsaid \xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x9d? Response options for all items ranged from never (0), 1 to 2 times (1), 3 to \nClear et al. 1207\n5 times (2), 6 or more times (3). The response of yes, but not in the past 12 months was\nalso an option but, for this analysis, we included it with never, because we were only\ninterested in the past 12 months, not lifetime victimization or perpetration. Students\nwho reported that any of the items occurred at least 3 or more times in the past 12\nmonths were included in the sexual harassment definition. The Cronbach\xe2\x80\x99s alpha coefficient\nfor the three sexual harassment items indicated reasonable internal consistency\nfor victimization (\xce\xb1 = .66) and perpetration (\xce\xb1 = .71). We investigated the co-occurrence\nof sexual harassment victimization and perpetration by specific sexual harassment\ntactics by gender.\nDemographic and other risk factors for sexual harassment were also evaluated.\nThese included gender (female and male), high school grade (freshman, sophomore,\njunior, senior), race (categories summarized as non-White and White), receipt of a free\nor reduced price meal (yes or no, included as a proxy for family income), and sexual\nattraction (specifically, \xe2\x80\x9cPeople are different in their sexual attraction to other people.\nWhich best describes your feelings?\xe2\x80\x9d Responses included only attracted to females,\nmostly attracted to females, equally attracted to females and males, mostly attracted\nto males, only attracted to males, and not sure). Responses were grouped as attracted\nto the opposite sex only versus attracted to the same or both sexes. The intraparental\npartner violence question was as follows: \xe2\x80\x9cIn your family, how often did you see or\nhear one of your parents or guardians being hit, slapped, punched, shoved, kicked, or\notherwise physically hurt by their spouse or partner?\xe2\x80\x9d Response options ranged from\nnever to more than 10 times, but were dichotomized as yes or no. Questions regarding\nbeing bullied or having bullied others, respectively, were as follows: \xe2\x80\x9cIn the past 12\nmonths, how many times have you been bullied by another high school student?\xe2\x80\x9d and\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the past 12 months, how many times have you bullied another high school student?\xe2\x80\x9d\nResponse options ranged from never to more than 10 times for both questions;\nwe grouped answers as more than twice, 1 to 2 times, and never in the past 12 months.\nThere was one question on binge drinking: \xe2\x80\x9cIn the past month, on how many days did\nyou have 4 (if you are a female) 5 (if you are a male) or more drinks of alcohol in a\nrow (within a couple of hours)?\xe2\x80\x9d Response options ranged from I never drink to 20 to\n31 days; a dichotomous variable was created to identify those students who reported\nbinge drinking 1 or more days in the past 30, and at least 1 day in the past 30 days (yes\nvs. no).\nStatistical Analysis\nAll data were analyzed using SAS, Version 9.2. Because the purpose of this article is\nto document the rates of sexual harassment victimization and perpetration in this large\nhigh school population, adjusted rates are presented throughout Table 1 as well as\nTable 3. However, when investigating gender differences in rates, we adjusted odds\nratios (aOR) for demographic factors known to be covariates, including age (freshman,\nsophomore, junior, or senior), family income (the proxy of receipt of a free or\nreduced price meal: yes or no), race (White or non-White), sexual attraction (exclusively\nattracted to the opposite sex or not), and a history of parental or guardian partner \n1208 Violence Against Women 20(10)\nviolence (yes or no). In addition, these models were adjusted for the sampling design\nby blocking on the sampled high school (n = 26).\nSeparate logistic regression models were used to estimate aORs by demographic correlates\n(chi-square test of proportions; presented in Table 1). Due to the large sample size\nof this study, only p values of <.0001 were considered statistically significant. Chisquare\ntests of independence were used to compare the demographic distribution for the\nGreen Dot across the Bluegrass sample with high school students attending public\nschools in Kentucky in the 2009-2010 academic year (Table 2). Furthermore, state and\nnational Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) data by demographic attributes were used\nto determine how comparable our high school sample was with others using a similar\ndata collection methodology. Separate logistic regression models were also used to estimate\naORs by sex for sexual harassment victimization and perpetration (Table 3).\nResults\nStudent Response Rates\nApproximately 88.1% of all students enrolled in the 26 high schools on the day of the\nsurvey completed a Scantron\xc2\xae form. There were 20,806 students who completed a\nScantron\xc2\xae form and 23,605 students present on survey day at their school. Of those\n20,806 completing a Scantron\xc2\xae, 82 were parental refusals (0.4%), 1,454 were student\nrefusals (7.0%), and an additional 182 students started the survey but completed less\nthan 30 of the 95 items (partial refusals, 0.9%), for an overall refusal rate of 8.3%.\nAnother 419 students were excluded from further analyses because they were missing\ndemographic or other covariate data; and 579 students were excluded because they did\nnot complete all sexual harassment items. The total analytic sample was 18,090 students,\nwhich was 86.9% of the 20,806 completing a Scantron\xc2\xae form.\nTable 1 provides the prevalence rates of any sexual harassment victimization and\nperpetration by demographic characteristics. Rates of both victimization and perpetration\nwere higher among underclassmen (freshmen and sophomores) than upperclassmen\n(juniors and seniors). Sexual harassment victimization and perpetration differed\nsignificantly by race; victimization was higher among non-White students (33.7%)\ncompared with White students (29.1%), as was perpetration (11.9% non-White students;\n7.8% White students). The majority (86%) of our sample identified themselves\nas attracted to the opposite sex only. Students who identified themselves as not exclusively\nattracted to the opposite sex had significantly higher rates of victimization\n(40.1%) and perpetration (14.2%) relative to those exclusively attracted to the opposite\nsex. Almost half (42.4%) of the students who disclosed sexual harassment victimization\nanswered that they had seen or heard intraparental partner violence. Students\nwho had witnessed intraparental partner violence also had higher sexual harassment\nperpetration rates (13.0%) compared with students who had not observed intraparental\npartner violence (6.9%). Students who answered that they were bullied had significantly\nhigher rates of sexual harassment victimization (57.2% among those bullied\nmore than twice) and perpetration (17.6%). A similar pattern held for bullying others \n1209\nTable 1.

This paradigm supports prior\nresearch literature in terms of the potential overlap of bullying and sexually harassing\nbehaviors. Students who reported any binge drinking in the past 30 days had higher\nrates of sexual harassment victimization (36.6%) and perpetration (14.5%) than those\nwho did not report binge drinking.\nTable 2 presents comparisons of the demographic profiles for the 18,669 high\nschool students surveyed who answered at least 30 questions in the survey with (a) the\nKentucky Department of Education (KDE) 2009-2010 school year high school population,\n(b) the 2009 YRBS data for the Kentucky high school sample, and (c) the\nnational 2009 YRBS data. Unadjusted chi-square statistics and associated p values\nwere calculated to compare the demographic distribution of the Green Dot samples\nwith the three full populations (KDE) or population-based samples (two YRBS\nsamples).\nFemale high school students were over-represented (53.5%) in the Green Dot baseline\ndata relative to those attending public high schools in Kentucky in 2009-2010 (n\n= 203,614; 48.6% female) and relative to both the Kentucky 2009 YRBS sample (n =\n1,777; 48.7% female) and the national 2009 YRBS sample (n = 16,410; 47.8% female).\nSeniors were under-represented in the Green Dot baseline data relative to the KDE\npopulations as well as the Kentucky YRBS and the national YRBS data. There were\nno differences in the proportion of students who were non-White (17.7%) or receiving\na free or reduced price meal (56.2%) in the Green Dot sample relative to the KDE data\n(17.5% and 55.0%, respectively). Kentucky YRBS data had fewer non-White students\n(14.4%) and, as anticipated, given the racial composition of Kentucky, a significantly\ngreater proportion of the YRBS national sample was non-White (41.3%).\nAmong the 18,090 students with no missing data (see Table 3), 29.9% disclosed\nexperiencing behaviors consistent with sexual harassment victimization. Prevalence\nrates, defined as experiencing one of three sexually harassing behaviors at least 3 or\nmore times in the past 12 months, were almost twice as high among females (37.1%)\nthan male students (21.4%): aOR = 2.05, p < .0001. A similar pattern of consistently\nhigher rates among female relative to male students held for each of the three tactics\nincluded in the sexual harassment victimization measure. Prevalence rates of sexual\nharassment perpetration were lower (8.5%) than the victimization rates (29.9%).\nFurthermore, the sexual harassment perpetration rate among females (5.1%) was\nlower than that among males (12.4%). This pattern held for all three tactics with aORs\nfor females relative to males ranging from .22 to .36 with all aORs being statistically\nsignificant (p < .0001).\nThe co-occurrence rate of sexual harassment victimization and perpetration\nwas relatively low; 5.1% of all students reported both, 3.4% perpetration alone,\n24.8% reported victimization alone, and two thirds of the students reported neither\nsexual harassment victimization nor perpetration.

One in three female students and one in five male\nstudents completing a survey for our large, cross-sectional study disclosed sexual\nharassment victimization. To the best of our knowledge, this was the largest population-based\nstudy to document the prevalence of sexual harassment perpetration. As\nanticipated, rates of sexual harassment were significantly lower for perpetration\n(8.5%) than for victimization (29.9%). Furthermore, although sexual harassment victimization\nrates were higher among females (37.1%) than males (21.4%), the inverse\npattern was observed for perpetration by gender (females 5.1%; males 12.4%).\nBecause there were no comparable data, we could not infer that our findings were\nsimilar to previously published results. However, we did find that a significant proportion\nof students were reporting harassment that had occurred 3 or more times, indicating\nthat sexual harassment is a chronic problem in high schools.\nThe findings of this study are consistent with limited research that has found males\nmore likely to be perpetrators of sexual harassment against females (Fitzgerald et al.,\n1999; Stein, 1993; Strauss & Espeland, 1992). Males were significantly more likely\nthan females to engage in sexually harassing behaviors, and females were more likely\nto report victimization. Similar to our findings, Hill et al. (2011) found that males were\nmore likely than females to admit they had sexually harassed other students (18%\nmales vs. 14% females).\nOur study found a significantly higher rate of both sexual harassment victimization\nand perpetration among those not exclusively attracted to the opposite sex, which is\nconsistent with reports by Fineran (2001). Students identifying as a sexual minority\nare known to be at increased risk of substance abuse and suicide ideation (Russell,\n2003; Savin-Williams, 1994). Careful attention should be given to the unique needs of\nthis potentially vulnerable group of adolescents.\nThe co-occurrence of both victimization and perpetration of sexual harassment\nshould be noted. Two studies reported that the majority (80% males and 92% of females)\nof students who disclosed that they had sexually harassed another were harassed themselves\n(Fineran & Bolen, 2006; Hill et al., 2011). Our findings were similar; of the 8.5%\nwho disclosed sexual harassment of others, 60.2% were also sexually harassed themselves\n(75.8% of females and 52.7% of males who harassed others). These consistent\nobservations suggest that intervention efforts to target sexual harassment perpetration\nlikely have benefits for reducing sexual harassment victimization rates, as well as\npotentially other forms of interpersonal dating and sexual violence.\nPrevention interventions aimed at high school students could improve the consequences\nof violence. Prevention interventions with a much younger population are\nwarranted given that freshman and sophomore students had the highest sexual harassment\nvictimization and perpetration rates. Furthermore, our observation of high sexual\nharassment rates (42.4% sexual harassment victimization and 13.0% perpetration)\namong those disclosing intraparental partner violence strongly suggests that patterns\nof family violence directly affect children\xe2\x80\x99s aggressive behaviors and their own risk of \nClear et al. 1215\nsexual harassment. Efforts to target aggressive behaviors such as bullying and sexual\nharassment that may be on the continuum toward dating and sexual violence could\nhave an impact in reducing the longer-term mental and physical health consequences\nof these more severe forms of gender-based aggression. Clearly, adolescents raised in\nhomes where partner violence was witnessed (25% of our sample) are an important\nfocus of intervention attention for early sexual harassment prevention intervention.\nBullying in schools is recognized as an important threat to students\xe2\x80\x99 mental health\nand academic achievement. Rates of bullying in this high school population (28.7%\nvictimization in the past 12 months) were similar to rates of sexual harassment victimization\n(29.9%). Students who disclosed being bullied also disclosed sexual harassment.\nSimilarly, those who bullied others also disclosed sexually harassing others (see\nalso Pepler et al., 2006). Events to reduce risk of bullying and sexual harassment have\nimportant implications for sexual and dating violence prevention. With an increase in\ncyber harassment and other \xe2\x80\x9cvirtual\xe2\x80\x9d ways to sexually harass, new prevention efforts\nare needed. This will be difficult, however, in a school environment where school officials\nare unaware of or unable to monitor the electronic communications of students.\nStrengths and Limitations\nThe demographic distribution of this sample was comparable with students attending\npublic high schools in this state; yet, the race distribution differed markedly for the\nUnited States as a whole. To the extent that rates of sexual harassment differed by race,\nour rates of sexual harassment may not be representative of rates generalized across\nthe United States.\nAs anticipated, females were more likely than males to agree to participate in this\nstudy, which addressed dating and sexual violence. This was possibly due to females\nseeing themselves as being at greater risk of gender-based violence. We did observe\nhigher rates of sexual harassment victimization among females, but higher sexual\nharassment perpetration by males. Thus, the gender-specific rates of sexual harassment\nare a more accurate reflection of population-based rates given different response\nrates by gender.\nIt is worth noting that we used a somewhat conservative definition of sexual harassment\nin that we required that the specific behavior needed to have occurred at least 3\nor more times in the past 12 months. Therefore, our sexual harassment rates may be\nlower than others using a less restrictive definition.\nConclusion\nThis was the largest population-based study to provide sexual harassment victimization\nand perpetration rates by students\xe2\x80\x99 self-reported sexual attraction, intraparental\npartner violence, bullying, and binge drinking. We found that females were more\nlikely to self-disclose sexual harassment victimization, and males were more likely to\nself-report sexual harassment perpetration. Although schools have sexual harassment\npolicies in place, awareness of what types of behaviors constitute sexual harassment, \n1216 Violence Against Women 20(10)\nas well as prevention interventions at earlier ages, could reduce the rates of these negative\nbehaviors that are affecting so many students.\nAuthors\xe2\x80\x99 Note\nThe findings and conclusions in this report are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent\nthe official position of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors would like to acknowledge everyone across the Commonwealth of Kentucky who\ncontributed to this research.

aS'Sexual harassment among adolescents of different sexual orientations and gender identities\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nThis article examines (a) variation in rates of sexual harassment acrossmode (e.g., in-person,\nonline) and type of harassment, (b) the impact of sexual harassment (i.e., distressing vs.\nnon-distressing), and (c) how sexual harassment is similarly and differently experienced\nacross sexual orientation and gender identity groups. Data were collected as part of the\nTeen Health and Technology online survey of 5,907 13 to 18 year-old Internet users in the\nUnited States. Past year sexual harassment was reported by 23\xe2\x80\x9372% of youth, depending\nupon sexual orientation, with the highest rates reported by lesbian/queer girls (72%), bisexual\ngirls (66%), and gay/queer boys (66%). When examined by gender identity, transgender\nyouth reported the highest rates of sexual harassment \xe2\x80\x93 81%. Overall, the most common\nmodes for sexual harassment were in-person followed by online. Distress in the form of\ninterference with school, family, and/or friends; creating a hostile environment; or being\nvery/extremely upset was reported by about half of the sexually harassed bisexual girls and\nlesbian/queer girls, 65% of the gender non-conforming/other gender youth, and 63% of the\ntransgender youth. Youth with high social support and self-esteem were less likely to report\nsexual harassment. Findings point to the great importance of sexual harassment prevention\nfor all adolescents, with particular emphasis on the unique needs and experiences of\nyouth of different sexual orientations and gender identities. Socio-emotional programs that\nemphasize self-esteem building could be particularly beneficial for reducing the likelihood\nof victimization and lessen the impact when it occurs.\n\xc2\xa9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This significant adolescent health\nissue is common in adolescence. One national survey suggested 2.8% of youth (ages 10\xe2\x80\x9313) and 9.3% of youth (ages 14\xe2\x80\x9317)\nin the United States were sexually harassed in the past year; 15.8% of 14 to 17 year-olds report ever experiencing sexual\nharassment (Finkelhor, Turner, Shattuck, & Hamby, 2013). Higher rates were reported as part of the American Association\nof University Women (AAUW) survey in 2001: 81% of students experienced some form of sexual harassment during their\n The project described was supported by Award Number R01 HD057191 from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.

A longitudinal study of 5th, 7th, and 9th graders in Wisconsin found past year rates of peer sexual\nharassment victimization increases with age from 38% of 5th grade girls to 78% of 9th grade boys (Petersen & Hyde, 2009).\nThe Definition of Sexual Harassment\nBecause of diverse legal, sociological, feminist, and psychological perspectives, a universal definition of sexual harassment\ndoes not exist (McMaster, Connolly, Pepler, & Craig, 2002), and thus, rates of sexual harassment vary widely across studies.\nAs with any form of victimization, types of sexual harassment range from minor forms, such as sexual jokes and comments,\nto severe forms, including sexual assault. The legal definition requires the harassment to create a hostile environment (U.S.\nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission, n.d.). Sexual harassment is not limited to face-to-face interactions; indeed,\nsuch victimization can also occur through the Internet and text messaging (Barak, 2005; Ybarra, 2003; Ybarra, Espelage, &\nMitchell, 2007; Ybarra, Mitchell, & Korchmaros, 2011).\nIn the current study, we take a broad approach to ensure we are capturing all possible forms of sexual harassment. We\ndefine sexual harassment as unwanted sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and sexual comments or gestures that\noccur in any environment.\nThe Importance of Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity\nLesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) youth seem to be particularly at risk for sexual harassment: 71% of gay,\nlesbian, bisexual, and questioning middle and high school students in the northeastern United States reported being sexually\nharassed during the school year compared to 32% of their heterosexual counterparts (Gruber & Fineran, 2008). A metaanalysis\nof the victimization experiences of lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals (adolescents and adults) across 386 studies\nbetween 1992 and 2009 found 50% of LGB individuals in the United States experienced sexual harassment (Katz-Wise & Hyde,\n2012). Among Canadian adolescents, sexual minority and questioning youth were also more likely than heterosexual youth\nto be victims of peer sexual harassment (Williams, Connolly, Pepler, & Craig, 2003). Similar findings have been documented\nby other researchers (Fineran, 2001; Williams, Connolly, Pepler, & Craig, 2005).\nBiological sex also seems to play a role in risk for sexual harassment. Females experience sexual harassment differently\nfrom males (Chiodo et al., 2009a) and more frequently: 13.6% of females ages 14\xe2\x80\x9317 years reported past year sexual harassment\ncompared to 4.7% of their male counterparts among a national sample of youth in the United States; lifetime rates were\n21.2% for adolescent females and 10.8% for adolescent males (Finkelhor et al., 2013). Females are more likely to be put down,\nobjectified, or treated differently because of their sex (Lindberg, Grabe, & Hyde, 2007), whereas males are more likely to\nexperience vulgar and homophobic comments (McMaster et al., 2002). Females also experience more of the physical forms\nof sexual harassment (e.g., touched, grabbed, or pinched in a sexual way; intentionally brushed up against in a sexual way)\nthan males (American Association of University Women Educational Foundation, 2001; Ontario Secondary School Teacher\nFederation, 1995).\nDespite research that suggests biological sex is influential in understanding sexual harassment, there is a noted paucity\nof research exploring the experiences of youth across gender identities and among youth who identify as transgender in\nparticular. Gender identity, including transgender, is different than sexual orientation: It is the knowledge of oneself as being\nmale or female. Transgender youth feel themselves to be of a gender different from their biological sex, which is separate\nfrom one\xe2\x80\x99s sexual orientation (i.e., gay, lesbian, heterosexual, or bisexual). Although data are lacking for sexual harassment\nspecifically, research on other forms of victimization support the hypothesis that transgender youth may be at heightened\nrisk. For example, compared to male and female gender LGB youth, transgender youth are even more likely to be physically\nharassed and assaulted (Greytak, Kosciw, Diaz, & Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network, 2009; Grossman & D\xe2\x80\x99Augelli,\n2006; Kosciw, Greytak, Bartkiewicz, Boesen, & Palmer, 2012; McGuire, Anderson, Toomey, & Russell, 2010). Ninety percent\nof transgender students heard derogatory remarks, such as \xe2\x80\x9cdyke\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cfaggot\xe2\x80\x9d in school at least sometimes during the past\nyear; 90% heard negative remarks about someone\xe2\x80\x99s gender expression (Greytak et al., 2009). More than half of transgender\nyouth have been physically harassed and more than one-quarter physically assaulted because of their gender expression or\nsexual orientation (Greytak et al., 2009). Illustrating how these data relate to sexual harassment more specifically among\nthis population needs to be a priority for adolescent health research.\nThe Impact of Sexual Harassment\nLittle is known about how sexual harassment may affect one\xe2\x80\x99s daily life, particularly for LGBT youth. Data from college\nstudents suggests that LGBT young people aremore deeply affected by the experience (Hill & Silva, 2005). Theymay feel angry,\nafraid, less confident, or more self-conscious and be dissatisfied with their college experience. Adolescent health research\nabout other types of peer victimization suggest that LGBT youth report greater disruptions in educational trajectories as a\nresult of their experiences (Collier, van Beusekom, Bos, & Sandfort, 2013). We need to better understand how many young\npeople experience disruptions in their daily functioning, including relationships with family and friends, and the ability\nto continue to feel able to navigate the world safely. Identifying factors \xe2\x80\x93 both risk (e.g., depressive symptomatology) and\nprotective (e.g., self-esteem) \xe2\x80\x93 that help explain one\xe2\x80\x99s vulnerability to this interference also is critical.\n282 K.J. Mitchell et al. / Child Abuse & Neglect 38 (2014) 280\xe2\x80\x93295\nUnderstanding Protective Factors for Sexual Harassment\nSupportive and accepting individuals in a LGBT adolescent\xe2\x80\x99s life can play a protective role reducing harmful effects of\nvictimization and other risk factors (Anhalt & Morris, 1998). Evidence has emerged that suggests protective factors, such as\nfamily connectedness and supportive adults, are not only associated with lower levels of risk for mental health problems and\nsuicidal ideation but also mitigate the negative relationships between victimization and risk (Eisenberg & Resnick, 2006).\nNot all LGBT youth have access to social support, however. Less than half (45.7%) of LGBT youth report that they have a\nstudent club in their school that addresses LGBT student issues. And youth who attended a high school with a gay-straight\nalliance (GSA) had less alcohol use, less depression symptoms, and less generalized psychological distress compared with\nyouth without a GSA in their high school (Heck, Flentje, & Cochran, 2011). Sexual minority adolescents have more difficulties\nin getting along with peers, teachers, and parents (Ueno, 2005). Among a community-based high school sample of LGBQ\nadolescents, sexual minority youth reported less social support from both peers and family members than their heterosexual\ncounterparts (Williams et al., 2005). This study also found that more social support was related to less victimization (i.e.,\nbullying, sexual harassment, and physical abuse by peers) and less externalizing and depressive symptoms.\nSelf-esteem is also critical for the well-being of LGBT youth. Research suggests that for LGBT youth, school victimization\nwas related to lower self-esteem (Russell, Ryan, Toomey, Diaz, & Sanchez, 2011). Further, students who experience higher\nlevels of victimization (i.e., harassment, assault in school) based on their sexual orientation or gender expression have lower\nlevels of self-esteem than those who report lower levels of the same types of victimization (Kosciw et al., 2012). Findings\nfrom the current study will add an important piece to the existing literature on the potential protective influences of social\nsupport and self-esteem for buffering the impact of sexual harassment among all youth, and LGBT youth in particular.\nAdditional Factors Missing from the Literature\nTechnology is now an integral part of the lives of adolescents. Use of the Internet by teens between the ages of 12 and 17\nin the United States has increased from 73% in 2000 to 95% in 2012 (Pew Internet & American Life Project, 2013). Moreover,\nin 2012, 74% of teens had mobile access to the Internet and 25% accessed the Internet mostly from their cell phone. Even with\nthis widespread use of the Internet among youth, little is known about how youth experience sexual harassment through\ntechnology. The limited data that does exist suggests a substantial percentage of youth (about 1 in 6) in the United States\nreport unwanted sexual experiences (i.e., someone trying to get me to talk about sex when I did not want to; someone\nasked me to do something sexual when I did not want to) via the Internet in a given year (Ybarra, Mitchell, & Espelage,\n2012; Ybarra et al., 2011). Whether sexual minority youth experience sexual harassment through technology differently\nfrom heterosexual youth has yet to be explored.\nIntimate and sexual relationships are normative, age-typical tasks for adolescents and these relationships have signifi-\ncant implications for health, adjustment, and psychosocial functioning (Bouchey & Furman, 2003; Collins, 2003). A healthy\nromantic relationship is related to a positive self-concept (Connolly & Konarski, 1994) and the development of important\ninterpersonal skills such as sharing, negotiation, disclosure, and intimacy (Feiring, 1996; Furman & Shaffer, 2003). Given\nhow central dating and sexual behavior is in the lives of adolescents, and the inherent sexual nature of the harassment\nexperiences under study, it is important to take into account adolescent\xe2\x80\x99s dating and sexual experiences when exploring\nfactors related to sexual harassment.\nHypotheses\nTo address these identified gaps in the literature, we will examine differences in sexual harassment rates and impact (i.e.,\ndistressing vs. non-distressing) by mode of harassment (e.g., online, in person), type of harassment (e.g., made obscene or\nsexual comments), youth behavior (e.g., dating and sexual activity), and protective factors (e.g., social support, self-esteem).\nWe also examine how these rates are similar and different across sexual orientation and gender identity groups. Based upon\nschool and adult data, we posit that LGBT youth will report higher rates of sexual harassment across modes; and that the\nimpact will be more severe among these youth.\nMethod\nParticipants\nTeen Health and Technology (THT) survey data were collected from August 4, 2010, to January 17, 2011, from 5,907\n13 to 18 year-olds in the United States. The survey protocol was reviewed and approved by the Chesapeake Institutional\nReview Board (IRB), the University of New Hampshire IRB, and the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network (GLSEN)\nIRB. We received a waiver of parental consent to protect youth who would be potentially placed in harm\xe2\x80\x99s way if their sexual\norientation was unintentionally disclosed to their caregivers.\nSample size challenges because of low base rates of LGBT youth (Kann et al., 2011) make it difficult to randomly select\na national, representative sample of children and adolescents 18 years of age and younger which is large enough to draw\nstatistically valid conclusions. For example, a population-based study of adolescents, 13 to 18 years old (Harris Interactive &\nK.J. Mitchell et al. / Child Abuse & Neglect 38 (2014) 280\xe2\x80\x93295 283\nGay, Lesbian, & Straight Education Network [GLSEN], 2005), has shown that about 5% of this population identify as lesbian,\ngay, or bisexual. The THT study was designed particularly to address this limitation. Participants were recruited from two\nsources: (a) the Harris Poll Online (HPOL) opt-in panel (n = 3,989 respondents) and (b) referrals from GLSEN (n = 1,918\nrespondents).\nThe HPOL and GLSEN samples differed in some expected ways, even after taking into account weighting. The HPOL\nsample was significantly more likely to be heterosexual (75% vs. <1%), younger (45% were ages 13\xe2\x80\x9315 compared to 39% of\nthe GLSEN sample), White race (68% vs. 63%), and live in a small town or rural area (40% vs. 33%). GLSEN participants were\nmore likely to be of Hispanic ethnicity (23% vs. 19%) and female gender (61% vs. 52%). We see age differences in ways we\nwould expect because of typical sexual development whereby one becomes increasingly aware of one\xe2\x80\x99s sexual self, including\nsexual orientation, with age. The differences in ethnicity and race were not clinically significant but statistically significant\nbecause of the large sample size. The noted differences in type of community were expected given the stigma associated\nwith being a sexual minority, particularly in smaller communities.\nProcedures\nThe survey was self-administered to all participants online. Qualified respondents were defined as (a) U.S. residents, (b)\nages 13 to 18, (c) in 5th grade or above, and (d) assented or consented to participate in the survey. The median survey length\nwas 23 min for HPOL respondents and 34 min for GLSEN respondents.\nHPOL respondents were invited through password-protected email invitations to participate in a survey about their\nonline experiences. A stratified random sample of U.S. residents was identified among four groups of HPOL members: (a) 13\nto 18 year-olds, (b) adults with a 13 to 17 year-old in their household, (c) adults with a child under 18 in their household,\nand (d) a general population of adults. Invitations to HPOL adults noted that the survey was intended for a 13 to 18 year old\nin the household and asked the adult to forward the survey link to the teen.\nAn oversample of LGBT teenagers was recruited into the study through GLSEN\xe2\x80\x99s referral efforts. GLSEN is the leading\nnational education organization focusing on ensuring safe schools for all youth, regardless of sexual orientation or gender\nidentity (www.glsen.org). GLSEN works to educate teachers, students, and the public about the negative impact of homophobia\nand heterosexism on a healthy school environment for youth. Most GLSEN referral respondents were recruited through:\n(a) emails sent with the survey link to GLSEN\xe2\x80\x99s distribution list and (b) publicizing the survey through targeted advertising\non Facebook.\nThe response rate for the HPOL sample was calculated as the number of individuals who started the survey divided by\nthe number of email invitations sent less any email invitations that were returned as undeliverable. The survey response\nrate, 7.2%, is within range of other recent national Random Digit Dialing (RDD) telephone surveys (Lenhart, Purcell, Smith, &\nZickuhr, 2010; Mitchell, Jones, & Wolak, 2011), even though the response rates of telephone surveys typically appear higher\nthan online response rates because it is impossible for online surveys to determine if the email has reached the intended\nrecipient\xe2\x80\x99s inbox (as opposed to being filtered out by spam filters), and individuals who have not \xe2\x80\x9cpicked up\xe2\x80\x9d their email.\nThe response rate for the GLSEN sample cannot be calculated as the denominator is indeterminable.\nWeighting procedures were used so that the data would behave as if they were nationally representative and to align\nthe two samples so that they could be combined into one dataset. Propensity weighting is a well-established statistical\ntechnique that, when applied to data, minimizes the issue of nonrandomness based on known covariates and establishes\nequivalency for those who are in the sample versus not because of self-selection bias (Rosenbaum & Rubin, 1984; Schonlau\net al., 2004; Terhanian & Bremer, 2000). HPOL data are consistently comparable to data that have been obtained from\nrandom telephone samples of the general populations once propensity weighting and appropriate sample weights are\napplied (Berrens, Bohara, Jenkins-Smith, Silva, & Weimer, 2003; Berrens, Bohara, Jenkins-Smith, Silva, & Weimer, 2004;\nSchonlau et al., 2004; Terhanian, Siegel, Overmeyer, Bremer, & Taylor, 2001). (See Ybarra, Mitchell, Kosciw, Korchamaros, &\nDiener-West, submitted for publication for more details about propensity score weighting in this study.)\nMeasures\nSexual orientation. Sexual orientation was measured with the following question: \xe2\x80\x9cBelow is a list of terms that people\noften use to describe their sexuality or sexual orientation. How would you describe your sexuality or sexual orientation?\nPlease select all that apply.\xe2\x80\x9d Response options included: Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Straight/heterosexual, Questioning, Queer, Other,\nor Not Sure.\nBecause youth were allowed to endorse multiple options, mutually exclusive categories were created at the data cleaning\nstage so that analyses could compare youth across sexual orientation categories. Responses were categorized based upon\nthe following hierarchy: Gay/Lesbian, Bisexual, Queer, Questioning, and Straight/Heterosexual. Thus, as an example, if an\nindividual identified as gay and queer, they were categorized as Gay/Lesbian; if an individual identified as bisexual and\nquestioning, they were categorized as Bisexual.\nGender identity. Gender identity was measured with the following question: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your gender? Your gender is how\nyou feel inside and can be the same or different than the answer you gave [when you were asked about your biological sex].\xe2\x80\x9d\nResponse options were male, female, transgender, or other (specify). Multiple response options were possible.\n284 K.J. Mitchell et al. / Child Abuse & Neglect 38 (2014) 280\xe2\x80\x93295\nFor the purposes of the current paper, we looked at a combination of sexual orientation-gender identities among youth\nwith the same biological sex and gender identities (termed cisgender) and gender identity separately. To examine sexual\norientation-gender identity we classified youth into eight groups: (a) Heterosexual boys, (b) Heterosexual girls, (c) Bisexual\nboys, (d) Bisexual girls, (e) Questioning boys, (f) Questioning girls, (g) Gay/queer boys, and (h) Lesbian/queer girls. The\nanalytic sample for analyses based on sexual orientation-gender identity was 5,139 as it was restricted to cisgender youth.\nThere was insufficient sample size to allow for categorization of transgender youth by sexual orientation. Therefore, in a\nseparate analysis, we focused on gender identity; youth were classified into four groups: (a) Cisgender males, (b) Cisgender\nfemales, (c) Transgender, and (d) Gender non-conforming or other gender. The analytic sample for analyses based on gender\nidentity was 5,498.\nSexual harassment. We measured sexual harassment in two separate ways: mode and type. To measure sexual harassment\nby mode, youth were presented with the following text: \xe2\x80\x9cNext we have a few questions about sexual harassment.\nWe say that sexual harassment includes: unwanted sexual advances, unwanted requests for sexual favors, someone saying\nsomething or doing something sexual when you do not want them to. Sexual harassment can happen anywhere, like at\nschool, at home, or other places you hang out. In the past 12 months, how often have you been sexually harassed...? (a)\nIn-person, (b) By phone call (on a cell phone or landline), (c) By text message, (d) Online, and (e) Some other way.\xe2\x80\x9d Response\noptions were every day or almost every day, once or a few times a week, once or a few times a month, once of a few time in\nthe past 12 months, never in the past 12 months. A positive response to any of the above modes was indicative of any sexual\nharassment in the past year by mode.\nTo measure sexual harassment by type youth were asked: \xe2\x80\x9cIn the past 12 months, how often have you been sexually\nharassed in the following ways? Remember that these things can happen anywhere, including in-person, online, and by text\nmessaging. Nine different types of sexual harassment were provided: (a) Someone spread sexual rumors or wrote sexual\nmessages about me in a public place such as the bathroom walls, in locker rooms, etc.; (b) Someone touched, grabbed, or\npinched me or grabbed my clothing in a sexual way when I did not want them to; (c) Someone intentionally brushed up\nagainst me in a sexual way when I did not want them to; (d) Someone blocked my way or cornered me in a sexual way\nwhen I did not want them to; (e) Someone made sexual or obscene comments that I did not want to hear; (f) Someone\nshowed or sent me sexual or obscene messages or pictures when I did not want to see them; (g) Someone asked me for\nsexual information about myself when I did not want to tell them (really personal questions, like sexual things I have done\nor what my body looks like); (h) Someone asked me to do something sexual when I did not want to; and (i) I was sexually\nharassed in some other way.\xe2\x80\x9d Response options were the same as those provided by sexual harassment by mode. A positive\nresponse to any of the nine items was indicative of any sexual harassment in the past year by type.\nTaken together, a positive response to any mode or type was coded as experiencing sexual harassment in the past 12\nmonths.\nDistress. Youth who reported at least one sexual harassment episode by either mode or type were asked a series of\nfollow-up questions to determine the impact of the experience. We did not query distress for each mode or type to reduce\nrespondent burden. First, youth were asked, \xe2\x80\x9cThink about the places where you were sexually harassed in the past 12 months,\ndo any of these places now feel scary, unfriendly, or uncomfortable?\xe2\x80\x9d Response options were yes/no. Next, youth were asked\nhow much being sexually harassed interfered with (a) Your (school) work or other responsibilities, (b) Your relationships\nwith friends, and (c) Your relationships with family members. Response options were: Not at all, Not very much, Somewhat,\nand A lot. Responses were coded as a lot/somewhat versus other. We then asked youth to \xe2\x80\x9cThink about the time you were\nsexually harassed that you remember the most. How did you feel when it happened?\xe2\x80\x9d Response options were measured on\na 5-point scale ranging from not at all upset to extremely upset; and coded as very/extremely upset versus all other responses.\nDemographic characteristics. Age was coded as 13 to 15 years, 16 to 17 years, and 18 years old because of high collinearity\nwith some of the psychosocial characteristics and sexual activities. Household income was measured: \xe2\x80\x9cHow would you\ndescribe your family\xe2\x80\x99s income?\xe2\x80\x9d Youth had three options: Lower than average, About average, and Higher than average. Those\nwho indicated their income was lower than average were compared to all other youth. Region was measured by asking\nwhere the respondent\xe2\x80\x99s school was located: In an urban or city area, In a suburban area next to a city, or In a small town or\nrural area. Youth reported their race (coded as White vs. other) and ethnicity (coded as Hispanic vs. other).\nAdditional covariates. To measure dating, youth were asked how many romantic relationships they had in the past 12\nmonths with someone they would call a boyfriend or a girlfriend. To measure sexual activity, youth were first asked whether\nthey had ever had consensual oral sex (\xe2\x80\x9cHave you ever had oral sex [we mean stimulating the vagina or penis with the mouth\nor tongue] when you wanted to?\xe2\x80\x9d), penetrative sex (\xe2\x80\x9cHave you ever had sex with another person that involved a finger or\nsex toy going into the vagina or anus when you wanted to?\xe2\x80\x9d), vaginal sex (\xe2\x80\x9cHave you ever, when you wanted to, had sex\nwhere a penis went into a vagina?\xe2\x80\x9d), and anal sex (\xe2\x80\x9cHave you ever, when you wanted to had sex where someone\xe2\x80\x99s penis\nwent into your anus?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cHave you ever, when you wanted to had sex where your penis when into someone\xe2\x80\x99s anus?\xe2\x80\x9d). All\nyouth who had oral, vaginal, or anal sex in the past 12 months were then asked, \xe2\x80\x9cHow many people have you had any type\nof sex with in the past 12 months when you wanted to? By sex we mean oral sex or sex where a penis, finger, or sex toy goes\ninto the vagina or anus.\xe2\x80\x9d Number of romantic relationships and sex partners were each coded as none, one, or two or more.\nIndication of depressive symptomatology was measured with a sum variable of the 10 items from the Center for Epidemiologic\nStudies Depression Scale \xe2\x80\x93 Revised (CESD-R; \xcb\x9b= .93). This scale asks respondents to report how often they have felt,\ne.g., like a bad person. Response options included not at all or less than 1 day in the last week; 1\xe2\x80\x932 days in the last week; 3\xe2\x80\x934\ndays in the last week; 5\xe2\x80\x937 days in the last week; and nearly every day in the last week. Respondents were coded to reflect having\nK.J. Mitchell et al. / Child Abuse & Neglect 38 (2014) 280\xe2\x80\x93295 285\nmajor depression (i.e., five or more symptoms all day, nearly every day for the past two weeks, one of which is anhedonia\nor dysphoria; and functional impairment at home, with friends, or at school (1) versus not having major depression (0).\nTwo aspects of the parent\xe2\x80\x93child relationship were queried: Emotional bond (e.g., how well do you get along?; 3 items:\n\xcb\x9b= .75) and Coercive discipline (e.g., how often does your caregiver spank or slap you; 3 items: \xcb\x9b= .56). These two subscales\nwere modified from the Youth Internet Safety Survey (Ybarra, Mitchell, Wolak, & Finkelhor, 2006). Each aspect was reflected\nby a sum score of youth responses to the subscale items for the corresponding subscale, with a higher score reflecting a\nworse relationship. For both variables, the continuous variables were highly collinear with other psychosocial variables in\nthe model. As such, they were dichotomized to reflect scores one standard deviation above the mean and higher versus all\nother scores.\nSocial support was measured as a summation of four items from the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support\n(\xcb\x9b= .94; Zimet, Dahlem, Zimet, & Farley, 1988). These items asked respondents to think about their friends who they first\nmet in-person, not online, and to report how much they agree (very strongly disagree to very strongly agree) that they can\ntalk about their problems with these friends, can share their happy and sad moments with these friends, can count on these\nfriends when things go wrong, and these friends really try to help them. Responses across items were summed so that larger\nvalues reflect greater support from offline friends and then coded to reflect scores two standard deviations above the mean\nand higher (1) versus all other scores (0). Self-esteem was measured using the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (1965); \xcb\x9b= .93.\nThis scale asks respondents to report how much they agree or disagree that, e.g., I certainly feel useless at times. Response\noptions ranged from strongly disagree to strongly agree. Responses were coded so that larger values reflected greater selfesteem,\nwere summed across items, and then coded to reflect scores one standard deviation above the mean and higher (1)\nversus all other scores (0).\nData Analyses\nUsing Stata/SE 11.2 (StataCorp, 2009), data were imputed usingmultiple imputation. Respondents who gave valid answers\n(i.e., not do not know answers) for less than 80% of the survey or those who did not meet valid data requirements (i.e., survey\nlength was less than 5 min; self-reported age at the beginning and end of the survey differed by more than a year) were\ndropped. The final sample size was 5,542.\nFirst, we examined how many youth reported sexual harassment victimization by sexual orientation-gender identity and\nthen by gender identity. We also estimated how many youth reported sexual harassment victimization by specific modes\n(e.g., in-person, online) and types for youth of different sexual orientations and gender identities. Next, we explored how\noften and in what ways sexual harassment resulted in distress, both by sexual orientation and gender identity. We used chisquare\ntests, corrected for survey weights (i.e., Design-based F statistics), to measure statistical differences between youth\nof different sexual orientation and gender identity groups. Two multinomial logistic regressions were used to estimate the\nodds of non-distressing and distressing sexual harassment (with no sexual harassment as a reference group) given a number\nof risk and protective factors suggested in the literature. All independent variables were entered at the same time into the\nmodels. We first focused on differences across sexual orientation-gender identity groups, and then focused on differences\nacross gender identity groups. Conditional odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals are reported for each. The models were\nadjusted for survey process measures: Self-reported honesty in answering survey questions, and completion of the survey\nalone or with other people in the room irrespective of statistical significance.\nResults\nRates and Impact of Sexual Harassment by Sexual Orientation-Gender Identity\nRates of past year sexual harassment varied significantly when examined by sexual orientation (Table 1). Lesbian/queer\ngirls reported the highest rates of past year sexual harassment (72%) across mode and type, followed by bisexual girls (66%)\nand gay/queer boys (66%). Heterosexual boys reported the lowest rate (23%). Information about individual modes and types\nof sexual harassment is detailed in Table 1. Across all sexual orientation groups, youth most commonly reported being\nsexually harassed in-person and online; they most frequently reported experiencing harassment in the form of obscene or\nsexual comments and being asked for sexual information. Overall rates of sexual harassment were higher when queried by\ntype rather than mode.\nYouth were impacted differently by the sexual harassment experiences. Distress included being very or extremely upset\nbecause of the harassment; interference with school work or other responsibilities, relationships with friends, and relationships\nwith family; and feeling like the harassment resulted in a hostile environment (places felt scary, unfriendly or\nuncomfortable). Over half (54%) of lesbian/queer girls and bisexual girls (52%) reported some type of sexual harassmentrelated\ndistress (Table 1). Heterosexual boys reported the least distress (33%). As shown in Table 2, all sexual orientation\ngroups were more likely to experience any sexual harassment and distressing sexual harassment in comparison to heterosexual\nboys.

Transgender\nyouth reported the highest rates of sexual harassment (81%), followed by gender non-conforming/other gender youth\n(69%). About half (52%) of youth identifying as female reported sexual harassment as did 34% of youth identifying as male.\nThese patterns held for sexual harassment by mode (e.g., online, in person) and by type (e.g., obscene or sexual comments,\nasked to do something sexual).\nMale youth reported significantly less distress than all other groups (37%). The other groups reported distress between 47%\n(female youth) and 65% (gender non-conforming youth). All groups of youth reported elevated odds of distressing and nondistressing\nsexual harassment in comparison to male gendered youth (see Table 2). Compared to male youth, the elevated\nodds of harassment-related distress were highest for youth who identified both as transgender and gender non-conforming\n(see Table 2).\nOther Characteristics Related to Sexual Harassment Victimization\nAs shown in Table 4, risk factors bivariately related to increased odds of both distressing and non-distressing sexual\nharassment included: Having at least one romantic partner in the past 12 months, at least one sex partner in the past\n12 months, high depressive symptomatology, high caregiver coercive behavior, and a poor emotional bond with one\xe2\x80\x99s\ncaregiver. High self-esteem was protective against distressing and non-distressing sexual harassment; high social support\nwas protective against distressing harassment. Lower than average income and Hispanic ethnicity were positively related\nto distressing harassment. Other demographic characteristics were not statistically significantly related to either type of\nsexual harassment experience.\nK.J.

Other\nyouth characteristics related to increased odds of distressing sexual harassment included having one or two or more romantic\npartners, one or two or more sex partners, high depressive symptomatology, and experiencing high coercive discipline from\nparents. Protective factors were also noted: Youth with high social support were less likely to report distressing sexual\nharassment, as were youth with high self-esteem. Findings for youth reports of non-distressing sexual harassment followed\nsimilar patterns, but conditional odds ratios were attenuated.\nLikelihood of Distressing and Non-Distressing Sexual Harassment by Gender Identity\nYouth identifying as female gender were 2.3 times more likely (95% CI [1.8, 2.9]) than male youth to report distressing\nsexual harassment (Table 6). Transgender and gender non-conforming youth had an even higher likelihood of distressing\nsexual harassment in comparison to male youth (COR = 6.5, COR = 5.6, respectively).

Consistent with previous literature (Greytak et al.,\n2009; Gruber & Fineran, 2008; Human Rights Campaign, 2012; Kosciw & Diaz, 2006; Williams et al., 2003), LGBT youth in the\ncurrent study reported victimization rates higher than their non-LGBT peers. Both sexual orientation and gender identity\nseem to be key factors in understanding risk for sexual harassment in adolescence. Findings add to the existing literature by\nidentifying differences across specific sexual minority groups and providing much-needed information about under-studied\ntransgender youth.\nThe Unique Experience of the Female Gender\nMost of the research that compares males and females in terms of their rates of sexual harassment are looking at biological\nsex and indeed, biological sex does matter. That girls report more sexual harassment than boys has been previously noted\nin large-scale, national studies in the United States (e.g., Finkelhor et al., 2013). Girls also experience sexual harassment\ndifferently than boys, as they experience more unwanted comments, gestures, and touch (Chiodo, Wolfe, Crooks, Hughes,\n& Jaffe, 2009b). Adolescent girls also consistently report more discomfort and negative consequences as a result of sexual\nharassment than boys (Lee, Croninger, Linn, & Chen, 1996). The immediate and long-term outcomes associated with sexual\nharassment are also often stronger and more negative for girls (Chiodo et al., 2009b).\nFindings from this study add to this existing literature in several ways. First, we specifically explored rates of sexual\nharassment by gender identity (i.e., the knowledge of oneself as being male or female). Transgender youth feel themselves\nto be of a gender different from their biological sex, and cisgender youth feel themselves to be of a gender that is the same as\ntheir biological sex. Second, our findings confirmed that this pattern of increased rates of sexual harassment for the female\nsex extends to all youth of the female gender, regardless of sexual orientation: Female heterosexual youth reported higher\nK.J. Mitchell et al. / Child Abuse & Neglect 38 (2014) 280\xe2\x80\x93295 291\nrates of sexual harassment and more distress than heterosexual males, bisexual girls more than bisexual boys, and lesbian\nyouth more than gay youth. Of particular interest, given our focus on sexual minority youth, is the motivational differences\nbehind same-sex versus opposite-sex sexual harassment (McMaster et al., 2002). For heterosexual youth, most oppositesex\nharassment is partly motivated by sexual interest, whereas same-sex harassment is more likely to be motivated by\naggression.\nOur data is limited in that we do not know the sex or motivation of the individuals behind the sexual harassment. Such\nknowledge is a critical next step in better understanding the differential experience of sexual harassment among LGBT youth\nand could play an important role in both primary and secondary prevention of sexual harassment for all youth.\nImpact of Sexual Harassment\nIn many cases, youth who were sexually harassed did not report a significant impact in their ability to continue to function\nin their daily lives as a result. For a notable number of youth, particularly sexual minority youth, however, the experience\naffected their relationships with their friends and family and their school work. The harassment also made certain places\nfeel scary or uncomfortable. Given the disproportionate victimization experienced overall by LGBT youth, perhaps they are\nmore vulnerable to distress for a number of reasons. First, it could be that the impact of victimization compounds already\nexisting stress due to stigma associated with being a sexual minority. The literature certainly documents elevated levels\nof emotional distress for LGBT youth, including depressive symptomatology, suicidal ideation, and self-harm compared to\ntheir heterosexual peers (Almeida, Johnson, Corliss, Molnar, & Azrael, 2009; Robinson & Espelage, 2011, 2012). Such distress\nis suggested to be a byproduct of the stigmatization associated with being a sexual minority in society (Martin-Storey &\nCrosnoe, 2012). More research is necessary.\nSecond, victimized LGBT youth tend to come out earlier and be more visible (D\xe2\x80\x99Augelli, Pilkington, & Hershberger, 2002)\nand may be more gender-atypical (D\xe2\x80\x99Augelli, Grossman, & Starks, 2006; D\xe2\x80\x99Augelli et al., 2002). In the current study, bisexual\ngirls, lesbian/queer girls, and gay/queer boys reported particularly elevated odds of both distressing and non-distressing\nsexual harassment; the same is true for gender non-conforming and transgender youth. Thus, \xe2\x80\x9cqueerer\xe2\x80\x9d youth appear to\nbe more likely sexually harassed than others. Some adolescents may have a degree of social uneasiness with what they\nperceive to be others\xe2\x80\x99 sexual ambiguity, whether it be gender identity or sexuality or a combination of the two, and this\nin turn becomes the impetus for the harassment. It amplifies the implicit message: You are different and it is because of\nyour sexuality. It may be too that one\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to the victimization is affected by one\xe2\x80\x99s stage of coming out or degree of\nself-acceptance: Those who are less assured or confident may be worried that the harassment will in some way \xe2\x80\x98out\xe2\x80\x99 them.\nPrevious research has suggested that these youth are more concerned about the way they will be received by peers and family\nwhen they disclose the experience (Carragher & Rivers, 2002; Ryan & Rivers, 2003). Studying the timing of sexual harassment\nvictimization in relation to these critical life events for LGBT youth is an important next step in our understanding of the\nimpact of victimization for this population. More generally, LGBT youth may personalize the victimization and attribute its\ncause to their sexual orientation, a core part of their self, whereas heterosexual and cisgender youth may attribute the cause\nto something external and less linked to their self and therefore feel victimization is easier to avoid in the future.\nA third reason LGBT youth may be particularly likely to experience distress because of the sexual harassment may be\nbecause LGBT youth are often subject to more intense victimization experiences (e.g., more targeted, more intrusive, more\nsevere; Dunbar, 2006). Examination of the specific details of the victimization incident itself would help determine this.\nResearch about youth experiences with other types of victimization supports this notion: Incident characteristics such as\nbeing targeted by adults, being asked to send a picture of oneself, and attempts at offline contact were all related to increased\nlikelihood of distress among youth who were harassed online in a national survey (Ybarra et al., 2006).\nFinally, fear could play a role in the elevated levels of distress as a result of sexual harassment for LGBT youth. Sexual\nminority youth report high rates of feeling unsafe at school: 64% of LGBT youth felt unsafe because of their sexual orientation\nand 44% because of their gender expression in the 2011 School Climate Survey (Kosciw et al., 2012). LGB youth are significantly\nmore likely than non-LGB youth to report being threatened with a weapon (DuRant, Krowchuk, & Sinal, 1998; Garafalo, Wolf,\nKessel, Palfrey, & DuRant, 1998), being involved in fights at school (DuRant et al., 1998), and have their property damaged\nwhile at school (Garafalo et al., 1998). Accordingly, LGB youth are significantly more likely than non-LGB youth to report\nmissing school because they feel unsafe (Coalition for Education on Sexual Orientation, 2005; Garafalo et al., 1998). As a\nresult, LGBT youth may react differently and more intensely to any form of victimization which could add to these elevated\nfeelings of being unsafe. Our findings suggest that LGBT youth, and bisexual girls, gay/queer boys, and lesbian/queer girls\nin particular, reported that places \xe2\x80\x9cfeel scary, unfriendly or uncomfortable\xe2\x80\x9d as a response to the sexual harassment they\nexperienced. Even larger numbers of transgender and gender non-conforming youth reported this to be the case. Findings\nsuggest the importance of ensuring safety for all youth, and LGBT youth in particular. Having teachers and other school\npersonnel who are openly supportive of LGBT students is an important first step in helping to alleviate such fear, both in\nterms of support for the LGBT student themselves and as role models for non-LGBT students. Teachers also need to intervene\nand stop instances of sexual harassment. Indeed, research examining school climate for transgender youth found that when\nschools took action to reduce harassment, students reported greater connections with school staff which were, in turn,\nassociated with greater feelings of safety (McGuire et al., 2010).\n292 K.J. Mitchell et al. / Child Abuse & Neglect 38 (2014) 280\xe2\x80\x93295\nOther Factors Related to Distress\nGiven the potential for the victimization to have a lasting impact on youth development, it is critical to understand concurrent\ninfluential factors contributing to an increased likelihood of victimization-related distress. Beyond sexual orientation\nand gender identity, additional factors associated with distressing sexual harassment victimization emerged. Youth with\nhigh depressive symptomatology were more than 2 times as likely to also report a distressing sexual harassment experience.\nIt may be that depressed youth are more likely to become distressed as a result of the sexual harassment; it may also be that\nyouth who are depressed are more likely to be sexually harassed because of some perceived or real vulnerability. Depression\ncould also be the outcome of distressing (and perhaps objectively more traumatic) sexual harassment. All scenarios likely\nhave a reality depending on the youth and the situation, although there is some support for sexual harassment to predict\nlower self-esteem and symptoms of depression for females in 8th grade, three years later (Goldstein, Malanchuk, Davis-Kean,\n& Eccles, 2007).\nSexual activity and romantic involvement were both associated with increased likelihood of concurrently reporting sexual\nharassment generally, and distressing harassment specifically. Perhaps these youth are engaging in activities through which\nthey are exploring their sexuality, and unexpectedly find themselves in sexualized situations that they did not want. More\nresearch is needed about how sexual harassment may fit into the potential continuum of healthy relationships.\nProtective Factors Related to Reduced Likelihood of Distress\nIn line with previous research (Kosciw et al., 2012; Russell et al., 2011; Williams et al., 2005), protective factors also were\nsuggested: For all youth, LGBT and non-LGBT, high self-esteem was significantly associated with lower odds of reporting a\ndistressing sexual harassment experience in the past year. This supports other literature suggesting self-esteem is critical for\nthe well-being of LGBT youth. For example, students who experience higher levels of victimization (i.e., harassment, assault\nin school) based on their sexual orientation or gender expression have lower levels of self-esteem than those who report\nlower levels of the same types of victimization (Kosciw et al., 2012). We also found youth with high levels of social support\nwere less likely to be distressed. LGBT youth may be particularly at a disadvantage because they often have less social support\nand fewer resources to help them cope with the victimization experience (Almeida et al., 2009). Among a community-based\nhigh school sample of LGBQ adolescents, sexual minority youth reported less social support from both peers and family\nmembers than their heterosexual counterparts (Williams et al., 2005). Less than half (45.7%) of LGBT youth report that they\nhave a student club in their school that addresses LGBT student issues. Youth with more internal and external resources\nappear to fare better when sexually harassed. It is also possible that people with high levels of social support or self-esteem\nare protected from sexual harassment in the first place. Regardless of the directionality of the relationships which requires\nfurther study, expanding the support network of LGBT youth, such as through online sources, may help bridge this gap in\nsupport. Indeed, compared to heterosexual youth, LGB youth are more likely to say that their friendships online are better\nthan their in person friendships. This finding suggests that for some youth, the Internet can be a source of social support\n(Ybarra, Palmer, Mitchell, & Reisner, in preparation).\nIs the Internet a \xe2\x80\x9cSafer\xe2\x80\x9d Place for LGBT Teens?\nThe Internet does not appear to provide a level playing ground or a place where LGBT youth can necessarily be buffered\nfrom the risk of sexual harassment that otherwise occurs in person. Indeed, after in person, sexual harassment was most\ncommonly reported as occurring online; this was true for youth of all sexual orientations and gender identities. In most\ncases, rates of sexual harassment via text were about half as common as those occurring in person. Even as access to and\nuse of the Internet and text messaging continue to grow as a preferred communication between youth (Lenhart, 2012),\ntraditional victimization routes (i.e., in person) are by far more common. At the same time, technology is a means of sexual\nharassment for youth and LGBT youth in particular. We found LGBT youth and lesbian/bisexual girls in particular reported\nsexual harassment via the Internet. Text-messaging-based sexual harassment was also most commonly reported by these\ngroups of youth. Effective prevention efforts necessarily need to include online and text messaging-based scenarios but not\nto the exclusion of content that targets in person interactions.\nThe Sexualized Nature of Bullying/Aggression\nResearchers have begun to bridge the once distinct literature of sexual harassment and bullying (Espelage & Holt, 2007;\nMiller et al., 2013; Shute, Owens, & Slee, 2008). Commonalities exist based on the nature or content of the bullying. Indeed,\nresearch has found the bully victimization of girls by high school boys to be overwhelmingly sexual in nature (e.g., Shute\net al., 2008). Bullying and verbal harassment experienced by LGBT students in particular is often sexual in nature; and this\nis especially true for harassment experienced by transgender people and lesbian and bisexual young women (Bochenek &\nBrown, 2001). The majority of LGBT teens have been harassed specifically because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.\nIndeed, 82% were verbally harassed and 38% physically harassed because of their sexual orientation; 64% were verbally\nharassed, and 27% physically harassed because of their gender expression (Kosciw et al., 2012). Overlap in victimization\nexperience also is noted. Youth who are victims of bullying report the highest rates of peer sexual harassment victimization\nK.J. Mitchell et al. / Child Abuse & Neglect 38 (2014) 280\xe2\x80\x93295 293\n(Holt & Espelage, 2005; Ybarra et al., 2012). Further, bullying perpetration and homophobic teasing are significant predictors\nof sexual harassment perpetration over time (Espelage, Basile, & Hamburger, 2012). A limitation of the current data is\nthe focus exclusively on sexual harassment. Additional bullying experiences were not included because the survey did not\nallow for the disentanglement of sexualized and non-sexualized bullying. It is possible that higher rates of victimization and\nassociated impact would be noted if bullying also were included in the analyses.\nLimitations\nAdditional limitations that need to be considered include the fact that this is a cross-sectional study, thus, temporality\ncannot be determined. Whether social support buffered sexual harassment, or a positive response to sexual harassment\nincreased social support, for example, cannot be determined in the current data. Further, the data are national, but required\nweighting to behave as if they were nationally representative. Selection bias in the unweighted data may exist because youth\nin the HPOL sample were required to be affiliated with the HPOL and in the GLSEN sample because youth were recruited\nthrough GLSEN networks. Although we took a cautious approach and are confident in our analytic strategies, findings should\nbe replicated in other national studies.\nThe data were self-reported online. There is a possibility that youth reports were not accurate because of, for example,\nconscious or unconscious misreporting, or adults responding to the survey. Multiple procedures were used to encourage\nhonest and accurate reporting. For example, respondents were encouraged to complete the survey while alone in a safe\nplace and were ensured that their responses were confidential. Participants did not receive incentives for their participation,\nreducing the benefit of completing the survey multiple times. The eligibility criteria, particularly the age range, were not\npublicized so that potential respondents would know what the right answers would be to qualify for the survey. Thus, we\nare confident that the data accurately reflect the characteristics and experiences of the youth who participated in this study.\nFinally, a critical element to the understanding of sexual harassment among sexual minorities may be whether the\nperpetrator is same- or opposite-sex, which cannot be determined within the current data. A better understanding of the\ncharacteristics of the perpetrator would help us better understand the motives behind the harassment, including whether\nsexual orientation was a key factor.\nConclusion\nFindings add to the growing literature in the field of youth violence documenting increased risk for sexual harassment\namong LGBT youth. This is true both in person, as well as in technology-based communications such as the Internet and\ntext messaging. Professionals should focus on the more nuanced differences in sexual harassment experiences among the\ndiverse groups of sexual minority youth. Motivations behind sexual harassment during adolescence are likely evolving and\nneed to be a focus of scrutiny, particularly among the complex developmental experiences of LGBT youth. Findings point to\nthe great importance of sexual harassment prevention for all adolescents, with a particular emphasis on the unique needs\nand experiences of youth of different sexual orientations and gender identities. Socio-emotional programs that emphasize\nself-esteem building could be particular beneficial for reducing the likelihood of sexual harassment victimization as well as\nlessen the impact when it occurs.\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank the entire Study team from Internet Solutions for Kids, the University of New Hampshire, the\nGay Lesbian Heterosexual Education Network (GLSEN), Latrobe University, and Harris Interactive, who contributed to the\nplanning and implementation of the study.

aS'Sexual Harassment, Bullying, and School Outcomes for High School Girls and Boys\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nA comparison of the impact of bullying and sexual harassment on five school\noutcomes was conducted on a sample of high school students. Results revealed that\nsexual harassment was a stronger predictor than bullying of all school outcomes for\nboth sexes, but especially for girls. This study suggests that sexual harassment, which\nactivates sexist and heterosexist stereotypes, erodes school engagement, alienates\nstudents from teachers, and adversely affects academic achievement, to a greater\ndegree than bullying does.\nKeywords\nsexual harassment, bullying, gender differences, school outcomes\nIntroduction: A Tale of Two Paradigms\nSchool administrators across America deal with a host of critical issues affecting students\nand their safety. Dating violence, drug abuse, and bullying\xe2\x80\x94most recently\ncyber-bullying\xe2\x80\x94have captured the attention of school officials, parents, and the\nmedia. Beginning with the Columbine shootings in the 1990s and continuing to recent\nhigh-profile student suicides that resulted from personal attacks posted on popular\nsocial websites, school bullying has become a focal issue for the development of\nschool programs and the allocation of resources. At the same time, scrutiny of school\nsexual harassment as a significant problem has waned. According to the court of\npopular opinion and judging by resource allotment, it would appear that bullying is\nperceived as more harmful than sexual harassment to the well-being and school\n1University of Michigan\xe2\x80\x93Dearborn, USA\n2University of Southern Maine, Portland, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nJames Gruber, University of Michigan\xe2\x80\x93Dearborn, 4901 Evergreen Rd, Dearborn, MI 48128, USA.\nEmail: jegruber@umich.edu\n599079 VAWXXX10.1177/1077801215599079Violence Against WomenGruber and Fineran\nresearch-article2015\nGruber and Fineran 113\nadjustment of students. However, the feast and famine of resources for bullying and\nsexual harassment, respectively, has occurred in a research vacuum: There is little\nempirical evidence to support bullying as a greater problem than sexual harassment for\nstudent well-being, school adjustment, or academic success. Not only is sexual harassment\ndisappearing from the agendas of school districts, but also behaviors that might\notherwise be defined as \xe2\x80\x9csexual harassment\xe2\x80\x9d are being subsumed under the expanding\nrubric of \xe2\x80\x9csexual bullying,\xe2\x80\x9d thereby ignoring their potential illegality (Brown,\nChesney-Lind, & Stein, 2007; Stein & Mennemeier, 2011).\nThe precipitous rise of bullying as a popular rubric for scrutinizing peer aggression\nprompted the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) of the U.S. Department of Education\nrecently to offer what essentially might be termed a \xe2\x80\x9ccourse correction\xe2\x80\x9d for school\nofficials and policy makers by sending a \xe2\x80\x9cDear Colleague\xe2\x80\x9d letter to all school districts.\nSpecifically, OCR strongly advised schools to distinguish between behaviors that are\ninappropriate and harmful from those that constitute a violation of Title IX. They\nadvised that \xe2\x80\x9cby limiting its response to a specific application of its anti-bullying disciplinary\npolicy, a school may fail to properly consider whether the student misconduct\nalso results in discriminatory harassment.\xe2\x80\x9d They continued with the warning that\nsuch neglect \xe2\x80\x9cmay lead to inadequate or inappropriate responses that fail to remedy\nviolations of students\xe2\x80\x99 civil rights\xe2\x80\x9d (U.S. Department of Education, OCR, October 26,\n2010). The memo reminds readers that Title IX prohibits gender harassment or harassment\nof both male and female students regardless of the sex of the harasser.\nConcerns have been aired for a number of years by scholars who worried about the\n\xe2\x80\x9cdegendering\xe2\x80\x9d effect (Stein, 2003) of bullying paradigms. Bullying behaviors are generally\nregarded as troubled interactions between a child and several of his or her peers.\nBullying has been defined in several ways, all of which focus on aggressive or meanspirited\nbehavior. Research and theory on bullying\xe2\x80\x94in particular, those based on\nOlweus, which is arguably the most widely used bullying model in the world (e.g.,\nOlweus, 1978, 1993)\xe2\x80\x94tend to focus on the personal or psychological characteristics\nof bullies (e.g., severe adjustment problems), situational factors that prompt bullying\nor the reciprocity of bullying behaviors (a number of adolescents are characterized as\n\xe2\x80\x9cbully/victims\xe2\x80\x9d), or what Brown and her colleagues (2007) refer to as the \xe2\x80\x9ctyranny of\nsameness.\xe2\x80\x9d The Olweus model, they contend, \xe2\x80\x9coffers a one-size-fits-all view of\nbullying . . . that erodes differences in gender as well as social class, race, ethnicity,\nsexual identity, and ability\xe2\x80\x9d (p. 1263). For example, the fact that most bullies are male,\nthat girls experience more harm than boys from sexual harassment, and that homophobic\ncomments are used routinely (mostly by boys) to humiliate and control others\n(primarily other boys) slips below the radar of scrutiny (American Association of\nUniversity Women Educational Foundation [AAUW], 2001; Espelage & Holt, 2001;\nKimmel & Mahler, 2003; Klein, 2006; McGuffey & Rich, 1999).\nSexual harassment, in contrast, might be defined as aggressive or mean-spirited\nbehavior with specific gender or sexual content that creates or reinforces an imbalance\nof power. The U.S. Department of Education (2010) defines sexual harassment as\n\xe2\x80\x9cunwelcome conduct of a sexual nature which may include unwelcome sexual\nadvances, requests for sexual favors, or other verbal, nonverbal, or physical conduct of \n114 Violence Against Women 22(1)\na sexual nature.\xe2\x80\x9d Although the adverse effects of bullying and sexual harassment may\nappear to be similar, we argue below that the experiences are fundamentally distinct\nand result in different outcomes. Specifically, we believe that sexual harassment\naffects students more adversely than bullying because harassment is directly related to\nhegemonic masculinity and therefore taps into potent structural and culturally sanctioned\nstereotypes and power relationships (masculine\xe2\x80\x93feminine, heterosexual\xe2\x80\x93\nhomosexual) that are central components of social stratification. Or, as Franke (1997)\nsays, \xe2\x80\x9csexual harassment is the technology of sexism. It creates a social context that\nfeminizes women, masculinizes men, and enforces gender norms to keep nonconformists\nin line\xe2\x80\x9d (p. 696). Hegemonic masculinity has three central characteristics: emotional\ndetachment (and correspondingly, derision of emotionality as a weakness),\ncompetitiveness (and a consequent development of gendered/sexual hierarchies), and\nsexual objectification of females such that masculinity is thought of as being superior\nto femininity (McGuffey & Rich, 1999; Robinson, 2005).\nFocal Issues of the Study\nThe present study will attempt to provide clarity to a critical social problem, peer victimization,\nwhich is clouded by murky policy and conflicting research studies. With\nthis in mind, our research addresses three questions, as follows:\nResearch Question 1: Which is the more common problem at school\xe2\x80\x94bullying or\nsexual harassment?\nResearch Question 2: Are there differences between the sexes with regard to peer\nvictimization?\nResearch Question 3: Do sexual harassment and bullying affect school attachment\nand academic performance in different ways?\nResearch Issues\nHow Much Bullying and Sexual Harassment Is There?\nIt is difficult to answer this seemingly straightforward question because of significant\ndifferences in survey design among researchers who focus on bullying or sexual\nharassment. Although \xe2\x80\x9cquestion/response format\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ctime frame\xe2\x80\x9d may seem like\npurely academic concerns, they have a direct bearing on reported frequencies of victimization\nthat are not only cited in academic journals but are also often publicized by\nhighly visible media outlets. The body of research that examines bullying and/or sexual\nharassment among adolescents might lead one to believe that bullying is fairly\ninfrequent although sexual harassment occurs in epidemic proportions. Generally bullying\nstudies, especially those using the Olweus protocol, report low rates, typically\nless than 15% (e.g., Eslea, Memesini, Moore, & Morita, 2003; Williams, Connolly,\nPepler, & Craig, 2005), whereas large, nationally representative surveys of school\nsexual harassment find victimization rates in excess of 80% (AAUW, 1993, 2001).\nGruber and Fineran 115\nThese wide divergences in victimization rates are due, among other factors, to the\nway questions are presented to the respondents and to the time frames they are asked\nto consider. With regard to the first issue, bullying studies typically ask students if they\nhave been bullied (e.g., \xe2\x80\x9cWe say a student is being bullied when . . .\xe2\x80\x9d), whereas sexual\nharassment surveys intentionally omit the term \xe2\x80\x9csexual harassment\xe2\x80\x9d from their queries.\nThe AAUW surveys, for example, asked students, \xe2\x80\x9cHow often has anyone done\nthe following things to you when you did not want them to?\xe2\x80\x9d and then listed 14 behaviors\nand asked them to indicate whether and how often they had experienced each.\nSexual harassment surveys have generally avoided using the term \xe2\x80\x9csexual harassment\xe2\x80\x9d\nin their survey instruments because it results in a significant underreporting of behaviors\nthat researchers or legal scholars might otherwise consider to be sexual harassment\n(Fitzgerald & Shullman, 1993; Gruber, 1990).\nAnother difference between bullying and sexual harassment research is the time\nframe for victimization or perpetration that is presented to respondents. For example,\nDeSouza and Ribeiros (2005) used \xe2\x80\x9clast 30 days\xe2\x80\x9d for bullying and \xe2\x80\x9clast 12 months\xe2\x80\x9d for\nsexual harassment. Similarly, Williams et al. (2005) framed bullying as experiences that\noccurred \xe2\x80\x9cduring the last 2 months\xe2\x80\x9d and sexual harassment as \xe2\x80\x9cduring the last 6 months.\xe2\x80\x9d\nHolt and Espelage (2007), using AAUW (2001) questions with a 1-year time frame\n(\xe2\x80\x9cduring the last 12 months\xe2\x80\x9d) along with their own bullying scale items and time frame\n(\xe2\x80\x9clast 30 days\xe2\x80\x9d), found that 70% of the students had been harassed whereas a little more\nthan half (54%) had been bullied. The AAUW surveys (1993, 2001) that reported harassment\nrates in excess of 80% asked students whether they had experienced unwanted\nsexual behavior at some point during their high school years. Therefore, it is not surprising\nthat sexual harassment might appear to be rampant in schools compared with bullying\nwhen the questions and response formats and the time frames differ substantially.\nObservations of everyday life in schools, whether these are based on reports from\nstudents, teachers, or parents, or from research, suggest that aggressive, inappropriate,\nor mean-spirited behavior is fairly common. Commonly used bullying scales (Holt &\nEspelage, 2007; Olweus, 1993) ask students about being teased, made fun of, pushed,\npicked on, and excluded from social groups. Their research suggests that much of this\nbehavior stems from individual or situational factors rather than specific categorical\ndiscrimination (e.g., gender-based harassment). In other words, sexually harassing\nbehaviors are more distinct and, therefore, less frequent forms of victimization than\nbullying behaviors.\nHypothesis 1: We predict that bullying will occur more frequently than sexual\nharassment. We believe that this difference will be borne out when bullying and\nsexual harassment items are presented in an identical manner in a survey.\nWho Are the Targets of Bullying and Sexual Harassment?\nThe AAUW study (2001) found a small gender difference: 83% of the girls and 79%\nof the boys reported being sexually harassed by a current or former student at school.\nEvidence of larger gender differences emerged in other studies. Specifically, girls \n116 Violence Against Women 22(1)\nexperience sexual harassment more frequently than boys, but boys perpetrate sexual\nharassment more often (Fineran & Bennett, 1999; Hand & Sanchez, 2000; Hill & Kearl,\n2011; McMaster, Connolly, Pepler, & Craig, 2002; Trigg & Wittenstrom, 1996). Trigg\nand Wittenstrom (1996) and the AAUW (2001) noted that the only sexually harassing\nbehavior that boys experienced at a higher rate than girls was being called gay.\nBullying is sex specific: Although boys bully girls, most of their activity is targeted at\nother boys (e.g., Espelage & Holt, 2001). Similarly, girls tend to bully other girls, but they\ninfrequently bully boys (Basile, Espelage, Rivers, McMahon, & Simon, 2009). Bullying\nis related to both socialization and developmental factors. These patterns have been established\nin international samples of students (Peskin, Tortolero, & Markham, 2006). As\nchildren reach middle school, sexual harassment becomes more frequent as dominance\nbehavior is driven more frequently by gender stereotypes and sexualized behavior\n(Pelligrini, 2001). Espelage, Basile, and Hamburger (2011) provided empirical evidence\nfor what they referred to as a bully sexual violence pathway. Specifically, bullying perpetration\nearly in middle school predicted sexual harassment perpetration 3 years later. An\nincrease in sexually harassing behavior between middle school and high school was also\nfound in a study of girls (Gruber & Fineran, 2007). In contrast to bullying, sexual harassment\ninvolves greater cross-sex behavior where girls are the primary targets of boys.\nHypothesis 2: Boys will experience more bullying than girls, but girls will experience\nmore sexual harassment.\nWhat Is the Impact of Peer Victimization on School Attachment and\nAcademic Success?\nOverall, it appears that the school outcomes for harassed and bullied students are quite\nsimilar. There are no studies, however, which offer a \xe2\x80\x9chead to head\xe2\x80\x9d comparison of the\neffects of each type of victimization. The AAUW studies (AAUW, 2001; Hill & Kearl,\n2011) found that students who experienced sexual harassment reported more school\nabsence or skipping classes, thinking about changing schools, lowered concentration,\nless participation in class, decreased quality of schoolwork, lower grades, and loss of\nfriends. Nearly a quarter of the students in the recent study reported not wanting to\nattend school because of their experience of sexual harassment. The impact was generally\nlarger among girls. Other studies that examined sex differences (Corbett, Gentry,\n& Pearson, 1993; Hand & Sanchez, 2000) revealed similar outcomes.\nBullying studies have tended to focus on psychological (e.g., depression, anger)\nand environmental (e.g., drug use, interpersonal/family violence, delinquency) stressors\nrather than academic and/or school performance variables, but there are some\nnotable exceptions. Nansel et al. (2001) found that poor academic achievement and\npoor relationships with classmates were associated with bullying and being a bully/\nvictim (both bully and victim). An Australian study (Skues, Cunningham, & Pokharel,\n2005) showed that students who were bullied by their peers at school tended to report\nfeeling less connected to their peers, teachers, and school and being less motivated to\nperform well at school\nGruber and Fineran 117\nWe would argue that three factors make sexual harassment distinctive as a form of\nvictimization. First, sexual harassment is directly linked to hegemonic masculinity. Or,\nas Robinson (2005) says, sexual harassment is a practice of \xe2\x80\x9cdoing hegemonic masculinity\xe2\x80\x9d\n(p. 20). Sexual harassment is driven by cultural stereotypes about gender and\nsexuality that function to construct and reinforce imbalanced power relationships.\nAlthough bullied students often receive disrespectful treatment because of individual\ndifferences\xe2\x80\x94for example, being perceived as too short, overweight, or unattractive\xe2\x80\x94\nsexual harassment activates stereotypes about gender and sexuality with deep cultural\nroots that reinforce dominance hierarchies (male/female, masculine/feminine) that are\narguably the primary bases of according power and privilege in society. These stereotypes\nnot only affect self-identity but also influence attitudes and beliefs, selfpresentations,\nand patterns of interactions within and between social categories (Swan\n& Wyer, 1997). Second, and related to the first, the asymmetrical nature of sexual\nharassment increases its impact. Bullying occurs both within and across sex groups.\nAlso, bullies themselves are often victims of bullying (hence, the term \xe2\x80\x9cbully-victim\xe2\x80\x9d\nthat appears widely in bullying literature). In contrast, harassment victimization is\nlopsided: It is targeted at specific categories of people, and the victims are handicapped\nin their ability to respond effectively and to ward off harm because of the\npower of cultural stereotypes. A substantial research literature on the effects of sexual\nharassment shows that these types of experiences, whether at work or in school, occur\nmore frequently among and have more adverse effects on girls and women than on\nboys and men (see Morgan & Gruber, 2011, for a review). Harassment not only affects\nhealth and well-being, but it also casts a pall on the work (Schneider, Swan, & Fitzgerald,\n1998) or school (AAUW, 2001; Hill & Kearl, 2011) environment that results in alienation\nand estrangement. Although girls and women tend to suffer more adverse effects\nfrom harassment than boys and men, the latter are not immune from experiencing emotional\ndamage. In this regard, sexual harassment as a method of doing hegemonic masculinity\naccounts for the power of homophobia. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender\n(LGBT) students have poorer mental and physical health, less engagement with school,\nand higher suicidality than their heterosexual peers (Gruber & Fineran, 2008; KatzWise\n& Hyde, 2012; Williams et al., 2005). The harm of homophobia extends to\n\xe2\x80\x9cstraight\xe2\x80\x9d boys as well. Poteat and Espelage (2007), for example, found that homophobic\nslurs compared with other types of comments resulted in increased anxiety and\ndepression, and greater alienation from school among middle school children, particularly\nboys. Along the same lines, Swearer, Turner, Givens, and Pollack (2008) discovered\nthat among boys, being called gay had a greater negative impact on depression,\nanxiety, and perceptions of school climate than bullying did. In sum, the sexual harassment\nparadigm better explains why some students are generally perpetrators (boys) and\nothers are victims (girls and \xe2\x80\x9cnon-masculine\xe2\x80\x9d boys) and why attacks on gender identity\n(e.g., homophobic slurs) cause more harm than other kinds of abuse.\nHypothesis 3a: Sexual harassment will have greater adverse effects than bullying\non school outcomes.\nHypothesis 3b: The impact of sexual harassment on school outcomes will be\ngreater for girls.\n118 Violence Against Women 22(1)\nMethod\nSample\nData were collected from students at a middle school and a high school in a suburban\nNew England community as well as from a middle school and two high schools in southeastern\nMichigan who completed paper-and-pencil surveys during classes that drew a\nwide range of students. Parental consent forms were sent home with the students. The\nparents were told that the survey covered a range of topics, including bullying and sexual\nharassment, attitudes toward school, and health and well-being. Students who received\nparental consent were given an assent form along with the survey during class. Both\nparental consent and student assent forms followed Institutional Review Board procedures\nwhich specified that the survey was voluntary and that information given by the\nstudents was confidential. The New England sample consisted of 236 girls and 337 boys;\nthe Michigan sample had 102 girls and 86 boys. The samples reflected both the racial\ncompositions of the schools and the communities in which they were located. The\naverage age of the students was 15 years. About a third of the sample was 16 or older; a\nquarter was 14 or younger. Seventy percent described themselves as White. African\nAmericans and Hispanics were 17% and 9%, respectively, of the sample. About half of\nthe parents (48% of mothers and 53% of fathers) had no more than a high school education.\nAbout a quarter (24% of mothers and 22% of fathers) had college degrees. The\nmiddle school response rate (53%) was higher than that of the high school students\n(48%). The response rate was 51% for New England and 56% for Michigan.\nMeasures\nBullying and sexual harassment. Ten survey items developed by Espelage and Holt\n(2001) and 14 items from the AAUW (2001) survey were used to measure bullying\nand sexual harassment, respectively. The bullying items, for example, asked students\nif they had been pushed, threatened, or excluded from social groups. The sexual\nharassment items included repeated date requests, sexual rumoring, touching of a sexual\nnature, and being the recipient of sexually offensive comments. Students were\nasked how often they had experienced each behavior (never, a few times [once or\ntwice], many times) since the beginning of the school year, who the perpetrators were,\nand about their reactions. After responding to the 24 items, students were asked additional\nquestions about their \xe2\x80\x9cworst experience.\xe2\x80\x9d Of interest for this article were\nresponses to the degree to which they found this worst experience to be annoying,\nembarrassing, offensive, disturbing, upsetting, threatening, or frightening. Each of 7\nitems had five response categories (not at all, slightly, somewhat, very, and extremely\nupset). A factor analysis of the 7 items resulted in a one-factor solution (eigenvalue =\n4.05, explained variance = 57.9%) The items were combined to create an Upsetting\nScale (range = 0-28): M = 13.4, SD = 6.08.\nThe 10 bullying and 14 sexual harassment items were factor analyzed separately using\nvarimax rotation. The result was a one-factor solution for each (Bullying: eigenvalue =\n6.2, explained variance = 61%; Sexual harassment [SH]: eigenvalue = 10.5, explained \nGruber and Fineran 119\nvariance = 80.4%). The individual items tapping frequency of experiences were\nsummed to create the respective scales of peer victimization. Each scale had high reliability:\nBullying (Cronbach\xe2\x80\x99s \xce\xb1 = .87) and SH (\xce\xb1 = .90). For regression analysis, we\ncreated scales that summed all the bullying or harassment experiences that a student\nhad had (0-20 and 0-28, respectively). The scales were reduced to 0-10 scales to eliminate\ncells with very low frequencies and to create scales of equivalent length. Because\nthis procedure captured both the range and frequency of bullying or SH, the scales\n(each 0-10) represent the preponderance of each form of peer victimization. For t tests\nand cross-tabulation, we defined a student as being bullied or harassed if he or she had\nthree or more different experiences at least a few times (e.g., a student was \xe2\x80\x9cbullied\xe2\x80\x9d if\nhe or she was teased, was pushed or shoved, and was excluded from friends). This\ndichotomous variable both acknowledges and extends the study of bullying published\nby Peskin and her colleagues (2006), who defined a victim of bullying as a person who\nhad experienced at least one type of bullying behavior at least 3 times in the last 30\ndays. In contrast, researchers have often labeled a student as being bullied or sexually\nharassed if she or he experienced a single type of behavior even once (AAUW, 2001;\nLeaper & Brown, 2008).\nSchool outcomes. Four measures of school attachment were used in this study along\nwith a measure of academic performance. The school outcomes were only modestly\nintercorrelated (.25-.45), which suggests that each tapped unique aspects of school\nexperiences (see Appendix A).\nOverall, School Satisfaction was one of three scales that we used from Bowen and\nRichman\xe2\x80\x99s (1995) School Success Profile. The seven items comprising this scale (e.g.,\n\xe2\x80\x9cI enjoy going to this school,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cEvery student is important at this school\xe2\x80\x9d) were factor\nanalyzed using varimax rotation. The result was a one-factor solution (eigenvalue =\n2.58, explained variance = 72%) that had good reliability (\xce\xb1 = .81). A 1-7 scale was\ncreated that accommodated cells with very low frequencies.\nTeacher Support was based on eight items with true/false response categories (e.g.,\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy teachers really care about me,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI receive a lot of encouragement from my teachers\xe2\x80\x9d)\ndeveloped by Bowen and Richman (1995). A one-factor solution resulted (eigenvalue\n= 3.23, explained variance = 48.6%). The scale (1-7) that resulted from\ncombining these items had good reliability (\xce\xb1 = .84).\nAcademic engagement. Thirteen items developed by Hanisch and Hulin (1991) to measure\nwork stress were modified by the authors to fit a school setting (e.g., \xe2\x80\x9cMade\nexcuses to miss school or class,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThought about leaving school without graduating\xe2\x80\x9d).\nThey were entered into a factor analysis with varimax rotation. Each item had five\nresponse categories ranging from never to many times. Three items had factor loadings\nbelow .50 and were dropped from further consideration. The first of two factors\n(eigenvalue = 5.85, explained variance = 45.1%) tapped students\xe2\x80\x99 problems with academic\nengagement (e.g., \xe2\x80\x9cIgnored homework assignments,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cSpent time daydreaming,\ndoodling in class\xe2\x80\x9d). The five items were summed and subsequently converted to a\n1-9 scale (\xce\xb1 = .85)\n120 Violence Against Women 22(1)\nSchool withdrawal was based on the second factor (eigenvalue = 1.68, explained\nvariance = 18.8%) that tapped students\xe2\x80\x99 commitment to staying in school. Five items\n(e.g., \xe2\x80\x9cThought about leaving school without graduating,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cSkipped school\xe2\x80\x9d) were\nsummed and converted to a 1-7 scale (\xce\xb1 = .81).\nAcademic performance (grades) was based on a single survey item that asked,\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your overall grade average this year?\xe2\x80\x9d Seven response categories ranged\nfrom mostly A\xe2\x80\x99s to mostly D\xe2\x80\x99s and F\xe2\x80\x99s.\nData Analysis Plan\nDifferent procedures were used to test the hypotheses. Cross-tabulation (and \xcf\x872) was\nused in Table 1. Tables 2, 3, and 4 presented the results primarily of t tests. Table 5\npresented the results of a \xe2\x80\x9chead to head\xe2\x80\x9d comparison of bullying and SH through\nregression analysis. Bivariate correlations were presented (Appendix A) to demonstrate\nthe modest correlations among the dependent variables. The decision to analyze\ngirls and boys separately was based on results from two outcomes of data analysis.\nFirst, bivariate correlations between each Gender \xc3\x97 Victimization variable (SH \xc3\x97\nGender and Bully \xc3\x97 Gender) and each outcome were significant (Appendix A).\nHowever, a stronger argument for separating girls and boys was made by regressing\nthree predictors\xe2\x80\x94gender, victimization (bullying or SH), and Victimization \xc3\x97\nGender\xe2\x80\x94on each outcome (Appendix B). This procedure revealed the unique contribution\nof each Victimization \xc3\x97 Gender variable in predicting an outcome independent\nof the influences of either gender or victimization. The SH \xc3\x97 Gender and Bully \xc3\x97\nGender variables each predicted four of the five outcomes. Overall, the interaction\nitems, though significant, were modest in size ranging from b = .094 (Gender \xc3\x97 Bully\nfor School Satisfaction) to b = .162 (Gender \xc3\x97 SH for Academic Engagement). We\nbelieve that these results provide a sufficient rationale for analyzing girls and boys\nseparately.\nTable 1.

Seventy-seven percent of\nstudents had at least one bullying experience during the school year; 63% had at least\none harassment experience. Using the 3+ experience threshold, the percentages\ndropped significantly: 53% of students were bullied, whereas 39% were sexually\nharassed. Our results support Hypothesis 1.\nBullying was a more common experience than sexual harassment. This was the\ncase for both sexes. For example, more than half of the boys were bullied (52%) but a\nlittle more than a third had been harassed 3 or more times \xcf\x872(1, N = 369) = 96.2, p =\n.000. However, the data did not support Hypothesis 2. We argued that boys would\nexperience more bullying whereas girls would encounter more sexual harassment.\nThere were, in fact, no significant gender differences in either bullying or sexual\nTable 2.

More\nthan three quarters of boys (77%) but less than half (45%) of girls were bullied by\nboys, \xcf\x872(2, N = 483) = 62.8, p < .000. In contrast, boys were perpetrators of sexual\nharassment among both boys and girls (70% and 64%, respectively). Our results are\nconsistent with other studies of perpetrators of bullying (see Basile et al., 2009, for a\nreview) and sexual harassment (AAUW, 2001; DeSouza & Ribeiro, 2005; Gruber &\nFineran, 2008; Hill & Kearl, 2011).\nBullying, harassment, and school outcomes. The initial procedures for testing Hypotheses\n3a (sexual harassment will have a greater impact than bullying on school outcomes)\nand 3b (girls will be affected adversely more so than boys) involved t tests, effect sizes\n(Cohen\xe2\x80\x99s d), and simple regression. The results enable us to test the hypotheses by\nconducting side-by-side comparisons\xe2\x80\x94that is, comparing the results from analyses of\nbullying and school outcomes (Table 2) with those from separate analyses of sexual\nTable 5.

This involves counting the number of significant\nt tests and comparing effect sizes and regression coefficient strength. Hypothesis\n3a receives modest support from the data. Regression coefficients and t tests are\nsignificant for all five bullying\xe2\x80\x93school outcome and all five sexual harassment\xe2\x80\x93school\noutcome relationships. However, the relationships are generally stronger for sexual\nharassment than for bullying. For example, the sexual harassment\xe2\x80\x93school satisfaction\ncoefficient (b = .279, p < .01) is stronger than the corresponding figure for bullying\n(b = .197, p < .01). Comparisons for teacher support, school withdrawal, and grades\nlead to the same conclusion. Only academic engagement has a larger coefficient for\nbullying (b = .258, p < .01) than for sexual harassment (b = .235, p < .01).\nHypothesis 3b receives considerable support from the data. This can be seen, first\nof all, by the number of significant t tests. There was a total of nine significant t tests\nfor sexual harassment and school outcomes (5 for girls, 4 for boys), but only four\n(3 for girls, 1 for boys) for bullying and school outcomes. More evidence of the greater\nimpact of peer victimization, especially sexual harassment, on girls can be found\nthrough a comparison of effect sizes. Effect sizes are substantially larger (arbitrarily\ngauged as a difference of .10 or greater) for girls for each school outcome and bullying\n(Table 2) and each outcome and sexual harassment (Table 3). In several instances, the\neffect size for girls is nearly twice as large as the one for boys. For example, the effect\nsize for sexual harassment\xe2\x80\x93school satisfaction for girls (d = .70) is much stronger than\nthe one for boys (d = .37). Effect sizes can also be used to compare results for bullying\nwith those of sexual harassment. In this regard, effect sizes are larger for sexual harassment\nthan bullying among boys for three outcomes (school satisfaction, school withdrawal,\nand grades). But among the girls, sexual harassment effect sizes are larger than\nthe corresponding ones for bullying for all five outcomes. For example, the effect size\nfor sexual harassment\xe2\x80\x93school satisfaction for girls is substantially larger (d = .70) than\nthe corresponding one for bullying\xe2\x80\x93school satisfaction (d = .32).\nThe data results from our side-by-side comparisons provide compelling evidence to\nsupport Hypotheses 3a and 3b. However, a stronger argument for the power of one\nform of victimization over the other in adversely affecting school outcomes can be\nmade through a head-to-head comparison where bullying and sexual harassment are\nanalyzed simultaneously in the same model.\nComparing bullying and harassment. If our analysis to this point is instructive, it would\nseem that sexual harassment is a stronger predictor of adverse school outcomes than\nbullying, especially for girls. To provide more compelling evidence in this regard, we\ncreated head-to-head comparisons. We accomplished this by entering bullying and\nsexual harassment together in regression analyses with each school outcome variable.\nSeparate analyses were conducted for the entire sample, girls, and boys. Because bullying\nand sexual harassment were correlated (r = .55, p < .01) collinearity diagnostics\nthat are available on SPSS 17.0 were conducted for each outcome and each group. An\nexamination of tolerance and condition index figures for the 20 regression equations\nrevealed that multicollinearity was not a problem because the lowest levels of the former\nwere .65 and figures for the latter did not exceed 11.0. Tolerance levels that are \nGruber and Fineran 125\nless than .10 (Norusis, 2004) or condition index levels more than 30 (Belsley, Kuh, &\nWelsch, 1980) indicate significant multicollinearity problems.\nThe results of our analyses for direct bullying-sexual harassment comparisons are\npresented in Table 5. Our interpretations of the data in Table 5 addressed three questions:\nWhat is the range of negative impact of bullying and sexual harassment (How\nmany outcomes were significantly affected by bullying or sexual harassment)? Second,\nwhich is the better predictor (i.e., a larger and/or significant coefficient) of each outcome?\nFinally, were there gender differences regarding the impact of bullying or sexual\nharassment on each outcome?\nA perusal of the regression coefficients in Table 5 revealed that sexual harassment\nhas overall a larger role in predicting school outcomes than does bullying. More specifically,\nbullying is a significant predictor in only 2 of 15 equations (academic engagement\nfor the entire sample, b = .158, p < .01, and for boys, b = .190, p < .01), whereas\nsexual harassment is a significant predictor in 14. Sexual harassment predicted each\noutcome for the entire sample with coefficients ranging from b = .290 (school withdrawal)\nto b = .159 (teacher support). There are, however, notable sex differences in\nnumber of significant relationships as well as in coefficient sizes. Bullying did not\npredict any of the outcomes for girls and only one for boys. In contrast, sexual harassment\npredicted all five outcomes among girls and four for boys. Among the girls, the\ncoefficients for sexual harassment ranged from b = .323 (school withdrawal) to b =\n.169 (grades). All of the harassment\xe2\x80\x93outcome coefficients for girls were larger than the\ncorresponding ones for boys. The answers to the three questions we posed earlier for\nour interpretations in this section are fairly straightforward. Sexual harassment had a\nbroader range of impact than bullying. Of 15 equations, sexual harassment was a significant\npredictor in 14, whereas bullying was significant in 2. Given this disparity in\nsignificant relationships, the answer to the second question\xe2\x80\x94which one is the better\npredictor\xe2\x80\x94was clear. With the exception of the two significant bullying\xe2\x80\x93outcome\nrelationships, sexual harassment coefficients were considerably larger than those for\nbullying in each direct or \xe2\x80\x9chead-to-head\xe2\x80\x9d comparison. Finally, the differential impact\nof victimization between the sexes was also noteworthy. Sexual harassment predicted\nall five outcomes among girls and four for boys. An overall picture of differences in\nthe adverse effects of peer victimization can be seen through the adjusted R2 values:\nThose for girls were all larger than the corresponding ones for boys.\nOur results, then, gave considerable support to Hypotheses 3a and 3b. Although\nboth bullying and sexual harassment are independently related to adverse school outcomes\n(Tables 2 and 3), it was only when they are regressed together that a clearer\npicture of the roles of each emerged (Table 5). The results for boys were unexpected.\nWe hypothesized that bullying would play a significant role in school outcomes for\nboys, whereas sexual harassment would be a greater factor among girls. Bullying, in\nfact, was not a substantial predictor for either sex. Boys were adversely affected by\nsexual harassment, though not to the degree that girls were. An interesting question that\narose from our data is as follows: Why does sexual harassment, which occurs less frequently\nthan bullying, have a greater impact on school outcomes? We argued earlier\nthat this is because of the power of sexism (and heterosexism) in causing harm, which\nis driven by sexual harassment. Our data showed that girls were more adversely affected \n126 Violence Against Women 22(1)\nthan boys by peer victimization (e.g., the regression coefficients and adjusted R2 values\nin Table 5 for boys were generally smaller than the corresponding ones for girls).\nBased on previous research, both on schools (AAUW, 2001) and workplaces\n(Schneider et al., 1998), which found that sexual harassment caused greater emotional\ndistress among females than males, we decided to compare the emotional reaction\nwith bullying and sexual harassment among those in our sample who had been victimized.\nThe data for such a comparison were drawn from a section of the survey where\nstudents who had checked 1 of the 10 bullying or 14 sexual harassment items were\nasked to describe their \xe2\x80\x9cworst experience.\xe2\x80\x9d Most of these experiences (56%) were\nsexual harassment. They were asked a series of questions about the experience (e.g.,\nperpetrator sex, location of the incident, person[s]), including how upset they were by\nthe experience. We posed two questions for this analysis: Is sexual harassment more\nupsetting than bullying? And are there gender differences with regard to the emotional\ndistress of bullying and sexual harassment? With regard to the first question, sexual\nharassment was significantly more upsetting than bullying, M = 14.2 and M = 11.6,\nt(365) = 2.79, p < .01. The answer to the second question was more complex. There\nwas a significant difference between sexual harassment and bullying for girls, M =\n15.3 and M = 12.8, t(182) = 2.93, p < .01, but not for boys. Finally, although girls were\nmore upset than boys by both bullying and sexual harassment, only the latter difference\nwas statistically significant, M = 15.3 and M = 12.7, t(202) = 3.04, p < .01. The\nstrong relationships between peer victimization and school outcomes among girls may\nbe due, in part, to the fact that they appraise their experiences differently than boys\n(Ormerod, Collinsworth, & Perry, 2007). Boys, for example, might be more reluctant\nto label experiences as \xe2\x80\x9cfrightening\xe2\x80\x9d because doing so would appear unmanly. Overall,\ngirls state that they are more upset than boys by the same types of harassment\xe2\x80\x94say,\nsexual jokes or comments. Another reason for the gender difference is that girls are\nexposed to more severe forms of sexual harassment\xe2\x80\x94for example, sexual touching/\ngrabbing or sexual rumors (Fineran, 2002; Hand & Sanchez, 2000). Our analyses (not\nshown) of the 24 individual bullying and sexual harassment items supported these\nexplanations. Girls stated that they were more upset than boys by a wide range of peer\nvictimization experiences, and at the same time, they experienced a higher incidence\nof severe harassment, such as sexual contact (touching/grabbing, kissing, forced sex)\nand sexual rumors. However, because of a low n for some of these individual items,\nwe did not place a great deal of confidence in these results.\nDiscussion\nThe Harm of Peer Victimization: Summary of Findings\nHigh school students today face a myriad of challenges in developing and maintaining\nhealthy relationships with family, peers, and schools. Many girls face challenges to\ntheir sense of well-being in a society that emphasizes slimness and beauty. A number\nof boys, especially those from lower-income backgrounds, fail to complete high\nschool. Gay and lesbian students face stigmatization in a society that refuses to\nacknowledge their rights and identity. In the sea of influences that affect adolescents\xe2\x80\x99 \nGruber and Fineran 127\norientation to school and academic achievement, we sought in this article to determine\nthe role of peer victimization. More specifically, we wanted to compare the impact of\nbullying with sexual harassment on school attachment and academic performance. We\nfound that when bullying and sexual harassment were measured in the same way with\nsimilar time frames, bullying occurred more frequently. There were no significant gender\ndifferences with regard to either.\nThe results of t tests and simple regressions for bullying and sexual harassment individually\n(what we referred to as side-by-side comparisons) revealed that both forms of\npeer victimization were significantly related to most of the school outcomes, suggesting\nperhaps that both have similar roles in affecting student attachment and performance. It\nwas only when bullying and sexual harassment were entered together in the same regression\nanalyses (head-to-head comparisons) that a very different picture emerged. In the\nvast majority of regression equations, sexual harassment emerged as the better predictor\nboth in terms of coefficient size and significance level. There were clear differences in\nthis regard. Four of the sexual harassment coefficients for school outcome variables\nwere larger for girls than boys. The adjusted R2 values provided further evidence of differences:\nThe values were higher for girls than boys on all five outcomes. In an earlier\nstudy, we found significant relationships between peer victimization\xe2\x80\x94sexual harassment\nin particular\xe2\x80\x94and health outcomes (Gruber & Fineran, 2008). In this article, we\nfound that peer victimization\xe2\x80\x94especially sexual harassment\xe2\x80\x94alienated students from\nschool, undermined their relationships with teachers, and adversely affected their grades.\nSexual Harassment: Back to School and Out of the Shadows\nFrom the early years of legal theory (e.g., MacKinnon, 1979) and social research (e.g.,\nU.S. Merit Systems Protection Board [USMSPB], 1988), sexual harassment was viewed\nnot as random acts of violence but as actions that were targeted. Specifically, men were\noverwhelmingly the perpetrators, women were disproportionately targets, and male dominance\n(or patriarchy) was the explanation. By the mid-1990s, legal theory and social\nresearch had expanded the concept of sexual harassment in two ways: by incorporating the\nsexual harassment of men (by other men) or same-sex sexual harassment and by enlarging\nthe concept of \xe2\x80\x9cgender harassment\xe2\x80\x9d to include words and deeds that disparaged and violated\nwomen and \xe2\x80\x9cnon-masculine\xe2\x80\x9d men. We believe that the concept that explains male\ndisparagement both of women and of men who are, or may appear to be, gay is hegemonic\nmasculinity. As we have argued, bullying paradigms cannot explain the categorical nature\nof the perpetrator\xe2\x80\x93victim dynamics that are played out on a daily level in workplaces and\nat schools across the world. Indeed, the \xe2\x80\x9cbully lens\xe2\x80\x9d may blind researchers, policy makers,\nand citizens to the obvious gendered nature of high-profile crimes (e.g., see Kimmel &\nMahler, 2003, for an analysis of perpetrators and victims of school shootings). Our research\nrevealed the distinctly gendered nature of peer victimization in two ways: Boys were overwhelmingly\nthe perpetrators, though girls and boys had fairly similar victimization rates,\nand girls experienced more adverse school outcomes and greater distress than boys.\nBut what about bullying? Does bullying not have an impact on children\xe2\x80\x99s lives? We\nare not suggesting that sexual harassment causes harm, whereas bullying does not. There \n128 Violence Against Women 22(1)\nis considerable evidence both in research and in the everyday accounts of school life\namong adolescents about the pernicious effects of bullying. We are suggesting, instead,\nthat definitions and measures of bullying cover a broader range of behaviors than sexual\nharassment. And this is both a strength and a weakness of scientific and popular conceptions\nof bullying. The strength of \xe2\x80\x9cbullying\xe2\x80\x9d is that it presents a snapshot of the toxic\nbrew of words and deeds that are part and parcel of everyday life for adolescents in\nAmerica and includes racist, sexist, and homophobic slurs along with pejorative comments\nabout weight, physical attractiveness, competence, and other personal characteristics.\nThe weakness of \xe2\x80\x9cbullying\xe2\x80\x9d is what Brown and her colleagues (2007) referred to\nas \xe2\x80\x9cthe tyranny of sameness.\xe2\x80\x9d Taunts about one\xe2\x80\x99s physical appearance or social incompetence,\nfor example, are not distinguished from racist, homophobic, or sexist taunts.\nWe feel that sexual harassment theory and more generally the concept of hegemonic\nmasculinity have several important applications with regard to our findings.\nThere is a significant research literature that documents the harm that peer victimization\n(bullying and/or harassment) causes to children\xe2\x80\x99s well-being. This article adds to\nthe growing body of work on the impact of victimization, especially sexual harassment,\non school attachment and performance. Although the impact on children\xe2\x80\x99s well-being\nmay be regarded as health issues, the effects of victimization described in this article\nfall under the rubric of organizational climate problems. We would urge researchers and\nschool administrators to think of the outcomes of climate problems that adults experience\nat work\xe2\x80\x94high turnover and absenteeism rates, low morale, poor productivity, and\nsuspicion of coworkers and supervisors (see, for example, Fitzgerald, Drasgow, Hulin,\nGelfand, & Magley, 1997; Willness, Steel, & Lee, 2007) as applicable to children at\nschool. Although adolescents may underachieve, feel detached from teachers, or think\nabout quitting school for a number of reasons (e.g., rapid changes in physical appearance,\nadjustment to a new school, family troubles), peer victimization, especially sexual\nharassment, should be thought of as not merely as something that happens at school but\nas a phenomenon that erodes the climate of a school. An example of this is a recent study,\nwhich found that frequent and severe experiences of sexual harassment not only had\ndirect adverse effects on children\xe2\x80\x99s well-being but also caused harm indirectly by creating\na climate where children believed that sexual harassment was tolerated by teachers\nand school administrators (Ormerod et al., 2007). The concept of hegemonic masculinity\nalso has important implications in terms of our findings. In particular, hegemonic masculinity\naccounts for the sharp imbalance in perpetration that we and others have documented.\nMales are bullies and harassers much more frequently than females. It also\naccounts for our finding that sexual harassment more so than bullying causes distress,\nespecially for girls. We believe that the concept of hegemonic masculinity extends to\nother research that documented the adverse impact of homophobic slurs on boys\xe2\x80\x99 wellbeing\n(Poteat & Espelage, 2007; Swearer et al., 2008). The bully/sexual violence pathway\n(Espelage et al., 2011) appears to have relevance to our study, albeit indirectly.\nAccording to their findings, bullying behavior in fifth grade predicted sexual violence/\nsexual harassment in eighth grade, or according to the authors, \xe2\x80\x9c. . . traditional bullying\nperpetration transform[ed] into more gendered harassment and aggressive behavior in\nthe form of homophobic teasing and sexual harassment\xe2\x80\x9d (Espelage et al., 2011, p. 64). \nGruber and Fineran 129\nBased on our findings about the greater role of sexual harassment in eroding school\nattachment and academic performance, we speculate that this pathway is the result of\nchildren learning more powerful ways to establish social dominance. In their ethnographic\nstudy of a summer camp, McGuffey and Rich (1999) discovered that children\nas young as 10 were already quite well versed in the practice of hegemonic masculinity:\nAthletic and competitive males established a hierarchy where they were at the top,\nwhile \xe2\x80\x9cnon-masculine\xe2\x80\x9d boys (who cried easily or played with girls) and most girls were\nmarginalized and stigmatized. Although other research has shown the increasing frequency\nof sexual harassment compared with bullying as children progress through\nschool, our research has added information on the gravity of this change for adolescents\xe2\x80\x99\nattachment to school and their ability to perform well.\nThis study\xe2\x80\x99s outcomes lead us back to the larger, more general issue of whether\nschools should be promoting anti-bullying programs over sexual harassment prevention\neducation. The prominence of bullying as a school issue in public discourse as\nwell as debates on the content of anti-bullying legislation progressing through many\nstate legislatures prompted the Federal government to step in recently and offer a\n\xe2\x80\x9ccourse correction\xe2\x80\x9d of sorts. By advising schools to be mindful of behaviors that are\nlabeled as \xe2\x80\x9cbullying\xe2\x80\x9d but are in fact legally \xe2\x80\x9csexual harassment,\xe2\x80\x9d the U.S. Department\nof Education emphasized what a number of researchers had argued for years: that\nsexual harassment involves words and deeds that are distinct from what is generally\nconsidered to constitute bullying. Refocusing public discourse and reminding school\nofficials and parents of the protections already afforded to children by sexual harassment\nlaws (embedded in civil rights legislation) would, among other things, prevent\nmislabeling from occurring on the wide scale as it does currently. As the number of\nstudies that address bullying prevention programs reveals, it is becoming clear that\nsuch programs do not curtail sexual harassment perpetration (Espelage et al., 2011).\nStein and Mennemeier (2011) summarize the issue as such: \xe2\x80\x9cTalking about bullying is\nnot an inoculation against sexual harassment/violence and, likewise, talking about bullying\nwithout talking about homophobia will not prevent homophobic conduct which\nmay be the pathway to sexual harassment/violence conduct\xe2\x80\x9d (p. 5).\nA cursory examination of Internet news articles noting adolescent suicides since\n2011 when the \xe2\x80\x9cDear Colleague\xe2\x80\x9d letter was issued confirms no change. Articles\ndescribing students sexually harassed at school are still described as students being\nbullied to death. Again, we can only speculate as to whether or not school personnel\nwould have been more proactive if the abuse had been labeled properly as a civil rights\nviolation (sexual harassment) rather than as an unfortunate \xe2\x80\x9cbullying\xe2\x80\x9d experience.\nThis study\xe2\x80\x99s outcomes hopefully point us in the direction of determining whether\nschools should be promoting anti-bullying programs over sexual harassment prevention\neducation. The stakes are too high to ignore.\nLimitations\nThis study was based on data drawn from three school districts in two states. A larger\nsample that included more students from a greater variety of schools would have added\nconfidence to our results. The fact that our results parallel those of other researchers \n130 Violence Against Women 22(1)\nwho have used the same measures of peer victimization does provide evidence of\ngeneralizability. A larger sample would also have enabled us to study the individual\nbullying and sexual harassment items in greater detail, especially those of a more serious\nnature (e.g., girls who are the victims of sexual rumors or boys who are physically\nthreatened and attacked). \xe2\x80\x9cBullying\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9csexual harassment\xe2\x80\x9d are terms that encompass\na broad range of behaviors and experiences. It would be useful for researchers,\npolicy analysts, and school administrators to know which types of bullying or harassment\nexperiences are especially serious and have aversive impacts on the well-being\nof adolescents.\nM/SD 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n1.

aS"Sociosexuality as predictor of sexual harassment and coercion in femaleand male highschool students\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nSexual harassment and coercion have mainly been considered from a sex difference perspective. While traditional social science theories\nhave explained harassment as male dominance of females, the evolutionary perspective has suggested that sex differences in the desire for sex\nare a better explanation. This study attempts to address individual differences associated with harassment from an evolutionary perspective.\nConsidering previous research that has found links between sociosexual orientation inventory (SOI) and harassment, we consider whether\nthis association can be replicated in a large, representative sample of high school students (N=1199) from a highly egalitarian culture.\nExpanding the previous studies which mainly focused on male perpetrators and female victims, we also examine females and males as both\nperpetrators and as victims. We believe that unrestricted sociosexuality motivates people to test whether others are interested in short-term\nsexual relations in ways that sometimes might be defined as harassment. Furthermore, unrestricted individuals signal their sociosexual\norientation, and while they do not desire all individuals that react to these signals with sexual advances, they attract much more sexual\nadvances than individuals with restricted sociosexual orientations, especially from other unrestricted members of the opposite sex. This more\nor less unconscious signaling thus makes them exploitable, i.e., harassable. We find that SOI is a predictor for sexual harassment and\ncoercion among high school students. The paper concludes that, as expected, unrestricted sociosexuality predicts being both a perpetrator and\na victim of both same-sex and opposite-sex harassment.\n\xc2\xa9 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Introduction\nSexual harassment at work represents a considerable\nproblem in the management of organizations (UN, 2006).\nEarly studies portrayed the traditional view of male\nperpetrators and adverse consequences for female victims\n(Fitzgerald, 1993). The feminist perspective has focused on\nmen's need for power as the root cause of conflict between the\nsexes, seeing sexual harassment as a tool of patriarchy\n(Browne, 2006; Studd, 1996). Sexual harassment is linked to\nthe need to dominate women accompanied by hostile\nattitudes (including condoning forced sex) and men's use of\ntheir organizational power to oppress their female subordinates\n(Smith & Konik, 2011; Tangri, Burt, & Johnson,\n1982). Evolutionary psychology (EP) presents an alternative\nperspective claiming that sex is the driving force in sexual\nharassment\xe2\x80\x94not males' need for power over women (Buss,\n1996; Vandermassen, 2011). We support Vandermassen's\n(2011) perspective that feminism and EP may mutually\ninform each other, but one needs to treat both approaches as\ntestable scientific theories (Buss & Schmitt, 2011). As such,\nthe contemporary discussion in the journal Sex Roles (Smith\n& Konik, 2011) may reflect a watershed in the debate\nbetween these two perspectives, resulting in less polemic and\nmore empirical testing (although see Liesen, 2011).\nSexual harassment is defined as unwanted sexually\noriented behavior such as offensive sexual attention or\nhostile behaviors that focus on gender (Fitzgerald, Collinsworth,\n& Harned, 2001; Studd, 1996). It is worth noting that\n\xe2\x80\x9cunwanted\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9coffensive\xe2\x80\x9d are from the perspective of the\nEvolution and Human Behavior 33 (2012) 479\xe2\x80\x93490\n\xe2\x98\x86 Preliminary analyses of some of the data reported in this paper were\npresented at HBES, June 2008, Kyoto. \xe2\x98\x86\xe2\x98\x86 Thanks to two anonymous reviewers for helpful comments. \xe2\x98\x85 Data collection was supported by a grant from S\xc3\xb8r-Tr\xc3\xb8ndelag County\nAuthority to M.B. and L.E.O.K.\n\xe2\x81\x8e Corresponding author.

Similar acts from more\nattractive persons might not be considered harassment, but\nrather be perceived as flirtatious (Browne, 2006). Sexual\nharassment covers various acts ranging from sexual\ncomments (obscene language and jokes) and spreading\nrumors, through inappropriate sexual advances to showing\npictures of nudity and sex. Sexual coercion is the use of\nphysical force to obtain sex.\nMost research on sexual harassment, conducted within\nthe hierarchical organizational context, has studied adult\nmale perpetrators and female targets. However, sexual\nharassment is common among high school girls and also\namong boys (American Association of University Women,\n2001; Bendixen & Kennair, 2008; Witkowska, 2005).\nStudies report 12-month prevalence rates in the 40%\xe2\x80\x9350%\nrange for sexist jokes, degrading and obscene sexual\ncomments, and homophobic insults. Nearly one in four\nhigh school students reported the spreading of sexual\nrumors, being shown pictures of nudity, and being asked\nfor sexual favors. Apart from homophobic insults, more girls\nthan boys reported harassment. Coercion is much less\ncommon but is still reported by a significant proportion of\nstudents (Bendixen & Kennair, 2008).\nSeveral findings support the sexual motives hypothesis\nadvanced by EP (Studd, 1996). The evidence is particularly\nstrong that victims of sexual harassment are not random\nwomen. They are disproportionally young, single, and\nemployed as low-level office workers, waitresses, or cooks\nin the service sector (Browne, 2006; Studd, 1996). From a\nmale perspective, gaining sexual access to a young and\nsingle woman would, potentially, bring greater reproductive\nbenefits than sexual access to an older married woman.\nReliable patterns of sexual harassment and coercion may\nbe predicted by EP (Buss & Kenrick, 1998). Over\nevolutionary time, the use of coercive means to gain sexual\naccess to unconsenting women increased the reproductive\nfitness for males but not for females. Differences in evolved\nsexual strategies (Buss & Schmitt, 1993; Trivers, 1972) and\nevolved mental mechanisms between the sexes explain why\nwomen perceive more situations as sexual harassment or\nwhy more men are perpetrators of sexual harassment (Studd\n& Gattiker, 1991), why more males overperceive sexual\nintent from the opposite sex (Haselton, 2003), or why the\nsame behavior by different men is perceived differently by\nwomen (Sheets & Braver, 1999).\nEvolved sex differences have been far more subject to\ninvestigation than individual differences, while there are\ngreater behavioral differences within the same sex than\nbetween the sexes (Simpson & Gangestad, 1991). Currently,\nthere is growing interest in evolved individual\ndifferences and explanations of within-sex differences\n(Buss & Hawley, 2010).\nThis paper addresses whether there are evolved withinsex\ndifferences that predict sexual harassment and coercion\nof others and predictors of being harassed or coerced. Early\nfindings (Bendixen & Kennair, 2008) suggest that there is a\nlarge overlap between those who harass others and those\nwho are targets of harassment. The etiology of this is not\nunderstood, and it remains open to question whether\nharassing others increases the risk of being harassed (or\nvice versa) or whether harassing others and being a target of\nharassment share common individually differing antecedents.\nWho is harassed, and how are they identified as\nexploitable by harassers?\nBuss and Duntley (2008) suggest that there are different\ntypes of exploitation\xe2\x80\x94and there will be different markers\nthat suggest whether or not one is prone to being exploited in\na specific area. Such areas of vulnerability are, therefore,\nperson and context specific. Evolved mental mechanisms\nwill be specifically orientated toward perceiving such signs\nof exploitability. For example, Sakaguchi and Hasegawa\n(2006) found that Japanese males used awkward gait as a cue\nto vulnerability for inappropriate touching. Moreover, the\nmale subjects' judgments were able to predict real-life sexual\nharassment, as reported by the female walkers. Exploitability\nis thus a specific quality of an individual that conveys to\npotential exploiters the following information (Buss &\nDuntley, 2008).\nSakaguchi and Hasegawa (2007) found that unexpected\nsexual attention was predicted by the targets' unrestricted\nsociosexuality as measured by Simpson and Gangestad's\n(1991) sociosexual orientation inventory (SOI; a stable\nindividual behavioral and attitudinal characteristic that\npredicts sexual behavior across many different situations).\nInappropriate touching of body parts was, however, not\npredicted by SOI. Hence, high-SOI persons are more\nsubject to harassment, but not necessarily to coercion in\nthis study.\nIndividual differences in SOI are discernible to observers:\nSOI may be estimated through visual cues such as facial\nfeatures and body language (Boothroyd, Jones, Burt,\nDeBruine, & Perrett, 2008; Gangestad, Simpson, DiGeronimo,\n& Biek, 1992; Sakaguchi & Hasegawa, 2007), and\nhigh-SOI females are rated to be more attractive than lowSOI\nfemales. In the light of Sexual Strategies Theory (Buss\n& Schmitt, 1993), the major sex difference in SOI (Schmitt,\n2005) is due to males being more open to short-term relations\n(Clark & Hatfield, 1989; Kennair, Schmitt, Fjeldavli, &\nHarlem, 2009), while females consider sexual relations more\nfrom a long-term perspective (Campbell, 2008; Haselton &\nBuss, 2001; Surbey & Conohan, 2000).\nIndividuals with high SOI scores thus seem to signal their\ngreater interest in short-term sexual affairs. These signals are\nperceived by others (Sakaguchi & Hasegawa, 2007).\nCompared to individuals with a restricted sociosexuality,\nthey will, therefore, attract more sexual attention\xe2\x80\x94not least\nfrom other unrestricted individuals of the opposite sex.\nIf we compared two females\xe2\x80\x94one with an unrestricted\nsociosexuality and one with lower SOI scores\xe2\x80\x94in a\nsocial setting, we might find the following: unrestricted\nsociosexuality elicits much more sexual solicitations. If the\nnumbers of solicitations were similar, the female with the\n480 L.E.O. Kennair, M. Bendixen / Evolution and Human Behavior 33 (2012) 479\xe2\x80\x93490\nlower SOI scores would find more of these harassing, as\nfewer of the attempts to interest her in having casual sex\nwould be desirable. But the total number of advances is\nexpected to be significantly higher due to the female with\nhigher SOI scores signaling availability, and not all of these\nare welcome; unrestricted females will not find all males\nattractive. This may add up to a higher total number of\nexperienced harassing advances. In addition, intrasexual\ncompetition would put high-SOI subjects at a higher risk of\nbeing subject to insults, slander, rumors, and other forms of\nderogation (Schmitt & Buss, 1996). High-SOI subjects are\nexpected to report more sexual harassment because they are\nthe object of both unwanted sexual advances from members\nof the opposite sex as well as derogation from same-sex\ncompetitors. We suggest that the perpetrators might perceive\ntheir victim's unrestricted sociosexuality as a cue to\nexploitability; high-SOI subjects will signal harassability.\nHigh-SOI individuals are probably not aware of the effects of\nadvertising their unrestricted sociosexuality to both desirable\nand undesirable potential sexual partners. It is the increased\namount of undesirable partners that increases the high-SOI\nindividuals' experience of harassability. While experiencing\nmore harassment, signaling high SOI also increases the\nnumber of desirable sexual encounters.\nHaselton (2003) found that unrestricted sociosexuality\nwas positively associated with the total number of misperceptions\nof sexual intention. Misperception and biased\ncommunication between the sexes might increase the level of\nperceived sexual harassment in society. Yost and Zurbriggen\n(2006) found that SOI predicted coercion. In their limited\nsample of adults, they also noted that females with high SOI\nscores had more fantasies about sexually dominating others.\nWe posit that behavior described as sexual harassment is\nprimarily behavior that intends to investigate whether the\ninitial perception of an unrestricted sociosexuality is correct,\nand whether \xe2\x80\x9chooking up\xe2\x80\x9d or other short-term sexual\nrelations are possible. Thus, sexually laden communication\nthat signals interest in physical aspects of sex and sexual\nsurgency, rather than love and commitment, is the hallmark\nof these interactions. Individuals with a restricted sociosexuality\nwill receive much less undesirable attention\xe2\x80\x94due\nto not advertising an interest in casual sex and signaling\nexploitability (behavior that increases the number of\nundesired sexual advances) to the same degree.\nIf the intention is to dominate or suppress, a perpetrator of\nsexual harassment ought to target individuals with restricted\nsociosexuality\xe2\x80\x94as those individuals would be most upset by\nthe behavior. We believe that the main intention is to solicit\nsex, and thus targeting individuals that advertise their\nunrestricted sociosexuality is the most effective strategy.\nConsequently, higher SOI scores will predict an increased\nlikelihood of being harassed, despite a greater interest in\nreceiving sexual attention from attractive partners. Furthermore,\nsexually aggressive and harassing behavior, understood\nas attempts to procure casual sex rather than a romantic\nrelationship, is also predicted by increased SOI scores.\nIn this study, the association between SOI and sexual\nharassment and coercion is examined using a large sample of\ngender egalitarian high school students in the context of\nmore traditional social science variables. Exposure to\npornography, coercive sexual attitudes, and sexist attitudes\nare all consistently found to correlate with self-reported\ncoercion (Begany & Milburn, 2002; Glick & Fiske, 1996;\nMalamuth, Addison, & Koss, 2000; Yost & Zurbriggen,\n2006). For this reason, measures of porn exposure (type and\nfrequency) as well as attitudes toward coercion (rape myths)\nand blatant, hostile sexism are included in our analysis. In\naddition, the analyses are extended to measures of being\nsexually harassed and coerced, as the prior literature on this\nparticular issue is scarce.\n1.1. Predictions\n1. Based on Sakaguchi and Hasegawa's (2007) findings,\nwe would expect that sociosexuality, as measured by\nSOI, is positively associated with self-reports of being\nsexually harassed among female respondents. Despite\nSakaguchi & Hasegawa's finding that unrestricted\nsociosexuality did not predict touching, we expect\ntheoretically that unrestricted females will signal their\nsociosexuality in such a manner that will also attract\nmore coercion.\n2. Based on Yost and Zurbriggen's (2006) findings, we\nwould expect that sociosexuality is positively associated\nwith perpetration of sexual harassment and\ncoercion among male respondents.\n3. We expect that the effect of SOI outlasts competing\nvariables such as exposure to pornography, coercive\nsexual attitudes (rape myths), and sexism.\nStudies on female sexual harassers and coercers are\nscarce. This also holds true for male targets of these\nbehaviors. We included female perpetrators as well as male\ntargets, which enabled us to study how sociosexuality relates\nto both sexual harassment and coercion in male and female\nrespondents as perpetrators and victims. The expectation of\nthis exploratory perspective is that SOI also predicts male\nvictims and female perpetrators. Our design also allows for\nthe examination of SOI as a predictor of same-sex and\nopposite-sex sexual harassment.\nThe competing social science predictions would suggest\nthat if male dominance is the primary motivation for\nharassment, there should be very limited female harassment\nof males and same-sex harassment. In addition, competing\npredictions would suggest that other social factors such as\ncoercive and sexist attitudes and porn exposure would\noutweigh the importance of SOI. The third alternative is\nMalamuth's (1996) confluence model, where both hostile\nmasculinity and sexual promiscuity predict male coercion.\nThis model combines feminist and evolutionary positions.\nL.E.O. Kennair, M. Bendixen / Evolution and Human Behavior 33 (2012) 479\xe2\x80\x93490 481\n2. Method\n2.1. Design and subjects\nA cross-sectional study covering students enrolled in nine\nhigh schools was carried out in Central Norway. In total,\n1610 (49.3% of 3260 eligible for study) students responded\nto a web-based questionnaire. Ages ranged between 16 and\n26 (modal age 17 years). An age-homogeneous sample was\ncreated including only those aged 16 to 18 years (95% of the\nsample). Approximately 5% of the students were selfnominated\nnon-Norwegians. Parents' level of education and\nemployment status were used as indicators of socioeconomic\nstatus (SES). Half of the students reported that their parents\nhad college or university education, and 85% reported both\nparents being employed. The final sample of 1199 students\ncovered clearly trustworthy, consistent, valid, and selfnominated\nheterosexual respondents.\n2.2. Procedure\nThe web-survey was carried out during November 2007.\nParents and school staff received written information about\nthe study, stating the purpose and content of the project.\nWritten informed consent was collected from students and\nparents. Classroom arrangements ensured anonymity and\nconfidentiality. The questionnaire and the procedure were\napproved by the Regional Ethics Committee and by the\nNorwegian Social Science Data Service.\n2.3. Measurements\n2.3.1. Independent variables\n2.3.1.1. Sociosexual orientation inventory. The study\nincluded three of the original five components described in\nSimpson and Gangestad (1991)1\n: (1) number of different\npartners in the past year; (2) number of different one-night\nstands ever; and (3) attitudes toward engaging in casual,\nuncommitted sex (three items). The scores were aggregated\nto indexes according to Simpson and Gangestad (1991).\nEach component's scores were standardized for each sex\nbefore totaling. Due to highly skewed distributions for the\ncomponents measuring number of past partners, these scores\nwere log-transformed before standardization. The components\nshowed good internal consistency (Cronbach's \xce\xb1=.71\nand \xce\xb1=.72 for males and females, respectively). We\naggregated the SOI scores into separate SOI-Behavior and\nSOI-Attitudes scales (Penke & Asendorpf, 2008; Webster &\nBryan, 2007).\n2.3.1.2. Exposure to pornography (porn exposure). The\nsubjects responded to three questions regarding whether\nthey used erotica and pornography during the past year,\nincluding erotic magazines, X-rated movies or magazines,\nand triple-X-rated movies or magazines, and one on the\nfrequency of use. Fifty-four percent of males and 2% of\nfemales reported weekly or more frequent use of erotica and\nporn. The four items were standardized before being\naggregated to form the index \xe2\x80\x9cPorn Exposure.\xe2\x80\x9d Internal\nconsistency for the index was acceptable (\xce\xb1=.66 and \xce\xb1=.72\nfor males and females, respectively).\n2.3.1.3. Coercive (sexual) attitudes. We developed a nineitem\ninstrument that measured beliefs and attitudes toward\nforced sex based on Lonsway and Fitzgerald's (1995) 19-\nitem \xe2\x80\x9cRape Myth Scale.\xe2\x80\x9d As this phenomenon is not\nrestricted to female victimization, the items were revised to\nincorporate an equal number of items covering acts carried\nout toward males and females. The wording was changed to\nease responding in younger populations. Five-point Likert\nscaling was used. Internal consistency was excellent (\xce\xb1=.86\nfor males and \xce\xb1=.88 for females). High scores on this index\nreflect denial of the negative consequences of being forced to\nhave sex, attributing responsibility to victims of sexual\nexploitation, and mistrusting the motives for reporting the\noffence to the police.\n2.3.1.4. Classical sexism. We used Ekehammar, Akrami,\nand Araya's (2000) seven-item instrument on classical\nsexism developed for and validated on Scandinavian\nsamples. Five-point Likert scaling was applied. Internal\nconsistency was good (\xce\xb1=.78 for males and \xce\xb1=.74 for\nfemales). High scores reflect approval of sex division of\nlabor, and blatant negative beliefs about women's logical\nreasoning and skills.\n2.3.1.5. SES. A four-point scale measured students'\nparent's highest level of education (separate items for\nmother and father). In addition, parent's work status\n(\xe2\x80\x9cnone working,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cmother only working,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cfather only\nworking,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cboth working\xe2\x80\x9d) was reported. The items were\nstandardized before aggregation.\n2.3.2. Outcome variables: sexual harassment and coercion\nThe index for measuring sexual harassment and aggression\nwas partly based on the work of Witkowska and\nKjellberg (2005) that was developed for use in Scandinavian\nteenage populations. This work built upon Fitzgerald,\nGelfand, and Drasgow (1995) and covered the basic\ndimensions of unwanted sexual behavior including indirect\nnonverbal forms of sexual harassment but excluding\ncoercion. In the present nine-item instrument, we added\ntwo items on \xe2\x80\x9cdigital\xe2\x80\x9d harassment (\xe2\x80\x9chaving received phone\ncalls, cell phone text messages, cell phone multimedia\nmessages or e-mail or chat with explicit sexual content\xe2\x80\x9d and\n\xe2\x80\x9csomeone distributed pictures of you with sexual content on\n1 Due to sample characteristics, the items \xe2\x80\x9cNumber of foreseen sexual\npartners\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cFrequency of sexual fantasy with other than your current\npartner\xe2\x80\x9d were omitted. Thirty-six percent of females and 46% of males\nreported not having had first intercourse, and 67% of females and 79% of\nmales reported not \xe2\x80\x9cgoing steady.\xe2\x80\x9d The two items were omitted due to\nquestionable relevance.\n482 L.E.O. Kennair, M. Bendixen / Evolution and Human Behavior 33 (2012) 479\xe2\x80\x93490\nthe internet or through cell phones\xe2\x80\x9d) to the indirect\ndimension. Coercion included four items on the use of\nexplicit physical force (sexual squeezing, touching of\ngenitals, kissing, and intercourse/oral sex). To ease responding,\nwe reduced the number of response alternatives to\n\xe2\x80\x9cnever,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9conce,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ctwice or more.\xe2\x80\x9d The inventory first\naddressed being subject to various forms of sexually\nunwanted behavior with the following instruction: \xe2\x80\x9cBelow\nyou'll find some questions regarding your experiences with\nunwanted sexual attention and harassment from others.\nPlease report only those acts that were offensive, unpleasant\nor that you clearly felt were unwanted.\xe2\x80\x9d The intention was to\navoid overreporting of insignificant and approved sexual\nattention. The social context was not restricted to the school\nenvironment. In five of the items, subjects were asked to\nindicate who performed the behavior and in which social\ncontext the behavior took place (at school and/or outside\nschool). This enabled us to examine separately the correlates\nof being targeted by same-sex or opposite-sex peers for a\nsubsample of harassing/coercive items. In the subsequent\nsection of the questionnaire, the subjects were asked\nequivalent questions about their sexual harassment and\ncoercion of others.\nThe 13 items on being sexually harassed and coerced\nwere dichotomized (Yes/No) before being aggregated into\ntwo indexes. Internal consistency was acceptable for the\nnine-item Sexually Harassed Scale (\xce\xb1=.73 for males and\n\xce\xb1=.76 for females) but low for the four-item Sexually\nCoerced Scale (\xce\xb1=.48 for males and \xce\xb1=.63 for females). The\nSexually Coerced Scale was dichotomized into No/Yes\nscores for analysis.\nThe 13 items measuring sexually harassing and coercing\nothers were dichotomized (Yes/No) before being aggregated\ninto their respective indexes. Internal consistency was\nacceptable for the nine-item Sexually Harassing Scale\n(\xce\xb1=.76 for males and \xce\xb1=.70 for females) but low for the\nSexually Coercive Scale (\xce\xb1=.48 for males and \xce\xb1=.40 for\nfemales). The Sexually Coercive Scale was dichotomized\ninto No/Yes scores for analysis.\n2.4. Analyses\nSex differences were calculated using Cohen's Effect Size\n(ES) formulas for continuous variables (d) and proportions\n(h). Associations among predictors and between predictors\nand outcome variables were measured using Pearson r. We\nfollow Cohen's (1988) standards for ES values and r.\nSequential regression analysis was performed on Being\nSexually Harassed and on Sexually Harassing Others using\nSOI-Behavior and SOI-Attitudes (Block 1), Porn Exposure\n(Block 2), and Coercive Sexual Attitudes and Classical\nSexism (Block 3) as predictors. Interaction terms (SOI\ncomponents\xc3\x97Porn Exposure, SOI components\xc3\x97Coercive\nAttitudes, and SOI components\xc3\x97Classical Sexism) and the\neffect of age-cohort were added as predictors in Block 4. The\nregressions were regularly checked for standardized residuals,\nand outliers outside \xc2\xb13 S.D. removed. For the two\ndichotomous variables on coercion, we adapted direct\nlogistic regression analyses on the five predictors. Assumptions\nwere checked throughout (using the Hosmer and\nLemeshow test), and outliers were removed. All analyses\nwere performed separately for each sex.\n3. Results\n3.1. Descriptives\nMales reported markedly more lenient attitudes toward\nunrestricted sex than females (Table 1), which held true\nacross all attitude items. Small sex differences were evident\nfor the behavior variables measuring the number of different\nsex partners reported in the past year. This was due to a larger\nproportion of females (63.4%) than males (47.7%) reporting\nhaving at least one sex partner during the past year. The\naverage number of different partners in the past year among\nthose who reported having had sexual partners was slightly\nhigher for males (M=2.6) than for females (M=2.1). Similar\neffects were evident for the variable measuring the number\nof different one-night stands. The proportion of one-night\nstands was slightly higher for females than for males (45.9%\nvs. 40.8%), but the average number of one-night stands was\nsimilar among those who reported one or more one-night\nstands (males M=2.2 and females M=2.1).\nA much higher proportion of males reported consuming\nerotic magazines as well as soft-core and hard-core\npornography. In particular, the frequency of exposure to\nerotica and pornographic magazines and movies was\nmarkedly higher for males than for females (d=1.79). Male\nrespondents also reported more lenient attitudes toward\ncoercive sex (M=2.61) compared to female respondents\n(M=2.08), producing a moderately high effect size.\nFemales reported being slightly more sexually harassed\nthan males, and far more females than males reported being\ncoerced (42% of females vs. 26% of males) (Table 1). The\neffect sizes for these sex differences were small to moderate.\nA moderate sex effect was found for harassing and coercing\nothers as male respondents reported stronger involvement in\nboth harassing others and the use of coercion (10% of males,\n3% of females).\n3.2. Correlations\nThe two SOI components were significantly associated\nwith Porn Exposure for both sexes (r's ranging from .11 to\n.25). The SOI components were insignificantly associated\nwith Coercive Attitudes and Classical Sexism in females.

Corresponding associations for males were\ngenerally weak but significant (nonsignificant only for\nSOI-Behavior). The two components of SOI were moderately\nassociated, but the disattenuated correlations (assuming\nno measurement errors) were strong (.56 for females and .47\nfor males). Despite the lower number of scale items, these\nassociations were highly comparable to those reported by\nWebster and Bryan (2007) for latent constructs. Finally, we\nfound that being harassed was substantially associated with\nharassing others in the male and female samples (r's above\n.60). This finding indicates that there was a large overlap\nbetween targets and perpetrators of sexual harassment in\nthese samples. Although the correlations were lower, this\nalso held for dichotomously coded sexual coercion scales.\nAdding to the complexity of this phenomenon, males and\nfemales who reported being exposed to high levels of sexual\nharassment also tended to report being coerced (r=.54 for\nfemales and r=.42 for males). Neither the student's SES nor\ntheir age cohort showed any association with the sexual\nharassment or coercion scales, although the latter correlated\nweakly with the SOI components.\n3.3. Predictors of being sexually harassed\nA hierarchical multiple regression was performed between\nbeing sexually harassed and SOI-Behavior and SOI-Attitudes\nin Block 1 (Model 1), Porn Exposure in Block 2 (Model 2),\nand Coercive Attitudes and Classical Sexism in Block 3\n(Model 3). This allowed for the study of mediator effects and\ndirect tests of Prediction 3. Interaction effects and the effect of\nage-cohort over and beyond that of the SOI components were\nentered in Block 4. Table 3 displays the unstandardized\nregression coefficients (B), standard error of the B, standardized\nregression coefficients (\xce\xb2), the corresponding t values,\nand the level of significance for each predictor at each step of\nthe analysis. Having an unrestricted sociosexual orientation\nmarkedly increased the risk of being harassed in females. The\neffect was stronger for the behavioral component of the SOI\nthan for the attitudinal component. As can be seen from Table\n3, the SOI components remained significant even after\ncontrolling for the contribution of the other variables (but the\neffect of SOI-Attitudes was only marginally significant in\nModel 2 and Model 3, pb.10). As seen in the lower panel of\nTable 3, the two SOI components accounted for fully 11.2%\nof the variance in being harassed in Model 1 (adjusted R2 was\n10.9%). Porn Exposure significantly predicted being harassed,\nadding 5.2% to the explained variance over and above\nthat of SOI. Porn Exposure also mediated some of the effect\nof SOI-Attitudes. As would be expected from the zero-order\ncorrelations, Coercive Attitudes and Classical Sexism did not\ncontribute to the prediction. None of the interactions\nsignificantly predicted being harassed, and age-cohort did\nnot contribute to the explained variance over and above that\nof SOI and Porn Exposure.\nSimilar to the results in the female sample, males with an\nunrestricted sociosexual orientation were more likely to be\nsexually harassed (Table 4). Again, the behavioral component\nwas a far better predictor for being sexually harassed than the\nattitudinal component. The two SOI components accounted for\n9.3% of the variance in being harassed. Adding Porn Exposure\nat Step 2 significantly increased the explained variance, but the\neffect of the SOI variables remained significant (SOI-Attitudes\nonly marginally, pb.10). Entering Coercive Attitudes and\nClassical Sexism at Step 3 contributed significantly to the\nexplained variance of being sexually harassed for males\n(1.4%), but only the latter reached significance. None of the\ninteractions (or age-cohort) contributed to the explained\nvariance in being sexually harassed.\n3.3.1. Predictors of being sexually harassed by same-sex or\nopposite-sex peers\nDescriptive analysis on the reduced four-item harassed\nscale showed that same-sex harassment was more prevalent\nthan opposite-sex harassment for males.

This is\nconsistent with the finding that males reported stronger\ninvolvement in sexual harassment of others (Table 1). The\noverlap for being harassed by a male peer as well as by a\nfemale peer was considerable (r=.71 for both sexes). To\nstudy the effect of the four predictors of same-sex and\nopposite-sex harassment in male and female respondents, we\ncarried out four separate multiple regressions (Table 5).\nThe behavior component of SOI turned out to be a\nconsistent predictor for same-sex and opposite-sex harassment\nin both sexes. This was also true for Porn Exposure.\nThe attitudes component of SOI was significant only for\nopposite-sex harassment in male respondents when the other\npredictors were included in the model. Coercive Sexual\nAttitudes failed to predict same-sex or opposite-sex\nharassment, and Classical Sexism was a marginal predictor\nonly for opposite-sex harassment in males (pb.10).\n3.4. Predictors of sexually harassing others\nFor female respondents, the attitudinal and behavioral\ncomponents of SOI were significantly associated with\nharassing others. The effect of the two SOI predictors was\nequal, suggesting that higher scores on SOI-Behavior or\nSOI-Attitudes were related to stronger involvement in\nharassing others. The SOI components accounted for 4.3%\nof the variance in the outcome variable. Porn Exposure was\npositively associated with harassing others and added 6.4%\nto the explained variance. Porn Exposure mediated some of\nthe effects of the SOI components, but SOI still predicted\nharassing others in the final model. Coercive Attitudes and\nClassical Sexism was not related to the outcome variable\n(Model 3). None of the interactions turned out to be\nsignificantly related to harassment (or age-cohort) and hence\nare not reported here (Table 6).\nSimilar to the female sample, males' scores on the SOI\ncomponents predicted sexual harassment of others, explaining\n9.6% of the variance. As can be seen in Table 7, Porn\nExposure added 4.3% to the explained variance. Adding\nPorn Exposure to the equation did, however, not influence\nthe effect of the two SOI components. Throughout the\nthree models, SOI-Attitudes was the stronger predictor of\nthe two SOI components. Adding Coercive Attitudes and\nClassical Sexism in Block 3 gave a significant increase\nin the explained variance (3.3%) over and above that of\nSOI and Porn Exposure, but the effect of the prior\npredictors remained unaffected. None of the interactions\nor age cohort was significantly associated with harassing\nothers in male respondents.\n3.5.

The test is considered conservative\n(increased type II error) (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2001). The\nlogistic regression for female respondents (n=557) showed\nthat high scores on SOI-Behavior, but not SOI-Attitudes,\nsignificantly increased the odds of being coerced by 70%\n(Wald [\xcf\x872\n]=22.11, df=1, pb.001, OR=1.7). Porn Exposure\nincreased the risk of being coerced by 1.6 (Wald=14.03,\ndf=1, pb.001). Coercive Attitudes and Classical Sexism did\nnot predict being coerced in female respondents. The effect\nof interactions and age-cohort was nonsignificant. The\npredictors accounted for 12.3% (Nagelkerke R2\n) of the\nvariance in being coerced, correctly identifying 42.8% of the\nobserved coerced cases.\nFor male respondents (n=527), the odds of being coerced\nwas marginally significantly associated with Porn Exposure\n(Wald=3.34, df=1, pb.10, OR=1.3).

The predictors accounted for only 5.7% of the\nvariance, correctly identifying only 4 of the 134 cases of men\nthat reported being coerced.\n3.5.1. Predictors of being coerced by same-sex or\nopposite-sex peers (one item)\nFemale respondents reported being sexually squeezed far\nmore by male peers than by female peers (18.6% and 2%,\nrespectively). The corresponding figures for males were\n5.6% (same-sex peer) and 7.3% (opposite-sex peer).\nEvidently, not only males are involved in this form of\ncoercion, but coercion is essentially a male toward female\nphenomenon. For this reason, the analysis discussed below is\nrestricted to females (n=555) reporting on unwanted sexual\nsqueezing from male peers. None of the other logistic\nregression analyses (female on female, male on male, female\non male) produced any meaningful or reliable results.

While SOI-Behavior significantly increased\nthe odds of being coerced by a man by 1.4 (Wald=6.06, df=1,\npb.05), SOI-Attitudes was not related to the odds of being\ncoerced by a man over and above the other predictors. Porn\nExposure marginally increased the odds of being coerced\n(Wald=2.99, df=1, pb.10, OR=1.3), while Coercive Attitudes\nand Classical Sexism failed to predict being coerced by\na man. The overall explained variance accounted for by the\npredictors was low, only 4.1%.\n3.6. Predictors of coercing others (males only)\nSince only 3% of the female sample reported being\nphysically coercive, meaningful predictions could only be\nperformed for males. Applying a hierarchic logistic regression\nanalysis to prediction of being coercive (regardless of\nsex of target) showed that neither of the two SOI components\npredicted coercion in male respondents. Only Porn Exposure\n(Wald=4.38, df=1, pb.05, OR=1.7) and Coercive Attitudes\npredicted coercion (Wald=4.31, df=1, pb.05, OR=1.6). None\nof the interactions were significant. Overall, the predictors\naccounted for merely 6.4% of the variance in being\nphysically coercive, but none of the 54 observed cases of\ncoercion were correctly identified.\n4. Discussion\nIn summary, SOI (especially the behavioral component)\nproved to be consistently associated with being sexually\nharassed in female respondents, in strong support of our\nfirst prediction. In addition, the behavioral component of\nSOI significantly predicted same-sex and opposite-sex\nharassment. Expanding earlier findings (Sakaguchi &\nHasegawa, 2007), SOI (behavior) was found to be\nconsistently associated in both harassed and harassing\nfemale respondents. SOI (behavior) and Porn Exposure\npredicted being coerced in females. Any other finding\nwould challenge our idea that unrestricted sociosexuality is\nsignaled and thus attracts those seeking short-term sexual\nrelations. Our second prediction was partly supported, as\nSOI consistently predicted male sexual harassment. However,\nSOI did not predict coercive behavior in men. In\nsupport of our third prediction, the effect of SOI remained a\nsignificant predictor of sexual harassment when the effect of\nporn exposure, coercive attitudes, and classical sexism was\naccounted for. This suggests, as we predicted, that\nharassment is due to sexual motivation rather than power.\nThis is further sustained through the bivariate associations\namong the predictors. SOI was moderately associated with\nthe use of pornography (suggesting sexual interest or\ndesire), while Coercive Attitudes\xe2\x80\x94reflecting the acceptance\nof physical force to obtain sexual access\xe2\x80\x94and Classical\nSexism were consistently not associated with either SOI or\nthe use of pornography.\nOur exploratory analyses regarding female perpetrators\nof sexual harassment evince similar patterns as in males,\nunderscoring the importance of SOI as a consistent\npredictor for sexual harassment. Too few females reported\ncoercion to perform any meaningful analyses. Similarly to\nfemales being sexually harassed, SOI consistently predicted\nbeing harassed in males. This was particularly\nevident for opposite-sex harassment and also for same-sex\nharassment (SOI-Behavior). SOI did not predict being\ncoerced in males.\nIt would seem, therefore, as predicted, that unrestricted\nsociosexuality increases exploitability for sexual\nharassment among males and females. Furthermore, an\ninterest in sex, but with less interest in emotional\nrelations and commitment, increases the likelihood of\nharassing others.\nThe competing prediction suggesting that male dominance\nover females is the primary motivation for harassment\nwas largely unsupported in this study. Not only was female\nharassment of males quite prevalent, so too was same-sex\npeer harassment. In addition, other competing social factors\ndid not outweigh the importance of sociosexual orientation\nin explaining variations in sexual harassment for either of the\nsexes. The finding that does not fit the general pattern is that\nSOI did not predict coercive behavior in males when\ncontrolling for porn exposure, coercive attitudes, and sexism.\nOur findings lend some support to Malamuth's (1996)\nconfluence model for coercive behavior, but not harassment.\nOne of the intriguing findings from our study was that the\nvast majority of male and female harassers also reported\nbeing harassed. Seeing the particularly strong overlap\nbetween harassing others and being harassed in relation to\nthe fact that unrestricted sociosexuality significantly contributed\nto variations in both being harassed and harassing,\none could speculate that SOI is one of several possible\ncommon factors for perpetrators as well as for victims of\nsexual harassment. When we tested this contention by\npartialling out the effect of SOI on the association between\nharassing others and being harassed, we found that SOI\naccounted for only a fraction of the common variance shared\nby these two variables.\nThe main idea behind our predictions was the\nhypothesis that harassment is an unrestricted sociosexual\nstyle of behavior, aimed at testing out whether a potential\nsexual partner is available for a short-term sexual\nencounter, and that perceived harassment behavior to a\nlarge degree is motivated by a desire for sex. However,\nmany instances of harassment in our study were cases of\nsame-sex harassment. This may be understood from a\nsimilar perspective. It is an example of sexual surgency or\ndominance, and sexual competitiveness (Campbell, 2004).\nThus, the logic of the evolved psychology of derogation\n(Schmitt & Buss, 1996) is relevant for understanding this\nbehavior. Same-sex harassment (mainly derogation) may\nbe understood as competition for the sexual interest of\nonlookers with similar unrestricted sociosexuality, who\n488 L.E.O. Kennair, M. Bendixen / Evolution and Human Behavior 33 (2012) 479\xe2\x80\x93490\nfind these persons sexually attractive because of their\nflaunted sexual surgency.\nThis study considered responses from both sexes on\nquestions regarding harassing others and being harassed. In\naddition, the variety of actions covered by this study\nallows for an analysis of both sexual harassment and\ncoercion. The present results from a younger sample, a\nmuch more homogenous, gender egalitarian culture, in a\nnonworkplace setting, provide a novel testing ground for\nless established power relations and sex roles than previous\ninvestigations\xe2\x80\x94and cannot merely be dismissed due to\nlack of gender equality (e.g., Eagly & Wood, 1999). Notably,\nharassment was rather frequent in this more egalitarian\nsetting. The results replicate previous findings (Malamuth,\nSockloskie, Koss, & Tanaka, 1991; Sakaguchi & Hasegawa,\n2007; Yost & Zurbriggen, 2006) and also expand these\nfindings to include female harassers and male victims, as well\nas suggest that sexual interest is the major driving force\nbehind harassment.\n4.1. Limitations and future research\nDespite having a large and comprehensive data set of\nhigh school students, we need to restrict our current\ninferences to young people in sexually liberal and gender\negalitarian societies with a high degree of porn exposure and\navailability. In addition, our study was cross-sectional,\nand in order to examine the etiology of sexual harassment\nand coercion, one needs to apply panel designs following the\nsame students over time\xe2\x80\x94as only a prospective, longitudinal\ndesign may address causality. Finally, our measure of\nattitudes toward coercion was based on prior measures of\nrape myths, which may have been too restricted for our\npurpose as the main attitude object was rape. As coercion\ninvolves numerous acts of physical force\xe2\x80\x94rape being one\nextreme act\xe2\x80\x94an attitudinal measure covering a broader set\nof forced sex may have produced partly different results. On\nthe other hand, and unlike prior use of measurements for\nrape myths, our measure was not restricted to attitudes\ntoward females.\n4.2. Conclusion\nWhile more boys sexually harass and coerce than girls,\nboth sexes commit sexual harassment and coercive acts. And\nwhile many different negative precursors and correlates have\nbeen suggested, it would seem that the main motive is an\ninterest in short-term sex\xe2\x80\x94indicated by an unrestricted\nsociosexuality. This same characteristic also causes behavior\nthat advertises an interest in sex, increasing the attraction of\nnonattractive partners. Furthermore, these individuals probably\nhave an increased interest in sexual competition, thus\nboth being subject to and partaking in same-sex derogation.\nThus, an unrestricted sociosexual orientation is related to\nboth harassing behavior and being a victim of harassment in\nhigh school.\nReferences\nAmerican Association of University Women (2001).

aS'Examining the Intersection of Bullying and Physical Relationship Violence Among New York City High School Students\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nResearch is just beginning to explore the intersection of bullying and relationship\nviolence. The relationship between these forms of youth aggression has yet\nto be examined in diverse urban centers, including New York City (NYC).\nThis study seeks to identify intersections of joint victimization from bullying\nand electronic bullying (e-bullying) with physical relationship violence (pRV).\nThis study examines data from the NYC Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS),\na representative sample of NYC public high school students, to assess the\nconcurrent victimization from bullying at school and e-bullying with pRV,\noperationalized as physical violence by a dating partner in the past 12 months.\nStudents who reported being bullied at school and e-bullied had increased\nodds (bullied: OR = 2.5, 95% CI [2.1, 2.9]; e-bullied: OR = 3.0, 95% CI [2.6,\n3.5]) of also being victimized by pRV compared with those who did not\nreport being bullied or e-bullied. In logistic regression models, being bullied\nat school and being e-bullied remained significant predictors of students\xe2\x80\x99 odds\n1Columbia University, New York, NY, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nZachary J.

This research is the first to assess the intersection of victimization\nfrom bullying and e-bullying with pRV in a large, diverse, random sample\nof urban high school students. In this sample, students who report being\nbullied or e-bullied are more likely also to report pRV than students who\nhave not been bullied or e-bullied. This research has potential implications for\neducators, adolescent health and social service providers, and policy makers\nto tailor programs and enact policies that jointly address bullying and pRV.\nFuture studies are needed to longitudinally assess both victimization from and\nperpetration of bullying and pRV.\nKeywords\nbullying, e-bullying, relationship violence, partner violence, peer victimization,\ndating violence\nPeer aggression in the form of bullying, electronic bullying (e-bullying), and\nphysical relationship violence (pRV) continues to plague youth in the United\nStates. Studies have consistently shown that more than a quarter of students\nexperience involvement in bullying (Nansel et al., 2001; Seals & Young,\n2003; Wang, Iannotti, & Nansel, 2009). Similarly, more than 30% of teenagers\nhave experienced physical aggression within a dating relationship, and\neven higher numbers of teenagers have experienced technology-assisted dating\nviolence (Stonard, Bowen, Lawrence, & Price, 2014). Research is beginning\nto show that students who have been victimized by one form of peer\naggression are at higher risk of further victimization from other forms of peer\naggression. However, this nascent research has yet to investigate the intersection\nof bullying with pRV in diverse settings. This study investigates the relationship\nof bullying and e-bullying with pRV in a large, diverse, urban sample\nof high school students while controlling for important demographic\ncovariates.\nBullying can be defined as any behavior that meets the following three\ncriteria: verbal or physical aggression, repeated over time, and involving a\npower differential (Olweus, 1993). Bullying can take on numerous forms\nincluding verbal bullying (e.g., teasing, name calling, spreading rumors),\nphysical bullying (e.g., pushing, hitting, pinching), or relational bullying\n(defined by Crick and Grotpeter, 1995, as \xe2\x80\x9cpurposeful attempts to harm\nanother\xe2\x80\x99s social relationships,\xe2\x80\x9d p. 712, such as social exclusion, spreading\nrumors, or manipulating friendships). E-bullying (also called cyberbullying) \nPeters et al. 51\nrefers to aggressive behaviors repeated over time that use technology to exert\npower over another individual (Smith et al., 2008). This includes spreading\nrumors about, teasing, or threatening someone using e-mail, text messages,\nchat rooms, or social media (David-Ferdon & Hertz, 2007). Relationship violence\nrefers to the use of physical, emotional, and/or psychological aggression\nby an individual to exert control over a dating partner (Wolfe et al.,\n1996). This article will focus solely on pRV, which is defined by physical\naggression (e.g., hitting, slapping, pushing, grabbing) within a dating relationship.\nOne major distinction exists between bullying/e-bullying and pRV;\nbullies and their victims are not necessarily friends or wanting to become\nfriends, whereas pRV occurs between individuals who share a romantic or\nsexual relationship.\nYouth who are bullied, e-bullied, and/or experience pRV are at an increased\nrisk for many adverse health and social outcomes, many of which overlap.\nYouth who have been bullied report higher rates of suicidal ideation (Robinson\n& Espelage, 2012), depression (Fitzpatrick, Dulin, & Piko, 2010), and substance\nuse (Nansel et al., 2001) than those who have not been bullied.\nE-bullying has a greater association with suicidal ideation than does traditional\nbullying (van Geel, Vedder, & Tanilon, 2014). Similarly, victims of\npRV also report higher rates of suicidal ideation (Belshaw, Siddique, Tanner,\n& Osho, 2012), depression, substance use (Exner-Cortens, Eckenrode, &\nRothman, 2013), eating disorders, and smoking (Bonomi, Anderson, Nemeth,\nRivara, & Buettner, 2013) than those who have not been victimized. Victims\nof bullying, e-bullying, and pRV report more negative attitudes toward school\nand poorer school performance than students without those experiences\n(Banyard & Cross, 2008). Poor school performance can have long-term psychological,\nphysical, and economic consequences. Victimization from pRV\nand bullying often begets violence and aggression in the victim. Youth often\nengage in reactive violence to avert victimization to pRV (Lamis, Leenaars,\nJahn, & Lester, 2013) and perpetrate violence in retaliation to being bullied\n(Swearer, Song, Cary, Eagle, & Mickelson, 2001). The negative health\nbehaviors and outcomes of victimization from bullying, e-bullying, and pRV\nare extensive and pervasive. These forms of aggression have immediate\neffects on the mental and physical health of victims, and many of these effects\npersist long after the initial victimization.\nAlthough pRV can be mutual within dating relationships (Messinger, Fry,\nRickert, Cattallozzi, & Davidson, 2014; Palmetto, Davidson, Breitbart, &\nRickert, 2013; Stonard et al., 2014), many instances of bullying, e-bullying,\nand pRV share one important similarity: They are often rooted in the unequal\ndistribution of power within a social relationship, where an individual uses\nphysical, verbal, and emotional coercion to intimidate another individual. \n52 Journal of Interpersonal Violence 32(1)\nResearchers have expressed concern that youth who bully to maintain power\nand control among peers may also exhibit these aggressive behaviors in their\ndating relationships (Connolly, Peplar, Craig, & Tarandash, 2000; Fredland,\n2008). In addition, with the increased use of technology to communicate\namong youth, electronic aggression has emerged as a major public health\nconcern, both in peer relationships and dating relationships (Stonard et al.,\n2014). Better understanding how these forms of youth aggression intersect\nwill help inform policy and programs that protect youth.\nInitial research on the intersection of bullying and pRV has shown significant\noverlap, suggesting that those involved in one form of youth aggression\nare at higher risk of involvement in other forms of aggression. Connolly and\ncolleagues (2000) assessed the dating activities of elementary students in a\nCanadian city who had been identified as bullies compared with a cohort of\nfellow students who were not bullies. They found that youth who bullied\nstarted dating earlier and were more likely to report being physically aggressive\nwith a boyfriend or girlfriend than their non-bully peers. Pepler and colleagues\n(2006) assessed the intersection of perpetration of bullying with\nperpetration of sexual harassment and dating aggression among 1,896 students\nin Grades 7 to 12 in a Canadian city. They found significant correlations\nbetween perpetration of bullying and perpetration of both sexual harassment\nand pRV. Espelage and Holt (2007) were the first to show that victims of bullying\nalso reported increased victimization from pRV compared with students\nwho had not been bullied. Similar findings emerged in a recent study among\npredominantly White students from rural New York, suburban New Jersey,\nand urban Pennsylvania; Yahner, Dank, Zweig, and Lachman (2015) found\nthat students who were bullied were 1.5 times as likely to also be victimized\nby relationship violence. Other researchers have begun to explore the intersection\nof bullying and other forms of youth aggression, including the possible\npathway(s) leading from bullying to sexual bullying (e.g., sexual\nteasing, unwarranted touching/pinching, indecent exposure, or sexual rumors)\nto pRV (Espelage, Basile, & Hamburger, 2012; Fredland, 2008; Miller et al.,\n2013).\nMost studies that have investigated bullying and pRV focus on middle\nschool cohorts in rural and suburban areas in middle America (Espelage &\nHolt, 2007; Robinson & Espelage, 2012). Research has yet to examine the\nintersection of victimization from different forms of bullying with pRV\namong high school students or in large urban areas. Preston (2009) highlights\nnumerous characteristics of urban schools that may increase aggressive\nbehaviors of students, including racially/ethnically diverse student populations,\nlarge student-to-teacher ratios, and large immigrant populations.\nAlthough studies have shown mixed results regarding increased prevalence \nPeters et al. 53\nof peer victimization in urban compared with rural areas (Hickman, Jaycox,\n& Aronoff, 2004; Marquart, Nannini, Edwards, Stanley, & Wayman, 2007;\nSpencer & Bryant, 2000), youth in urban areas are more likely to experience\nviolence of all varieties than students in rural and suburban areas (Ousey,\n2000). The present study will complement the existing literature by studying\nthe intersection of bullying and e-bullying with pRV in a representative population-based\nsample of high school students in NYC, a large urban center\nthat is unique in its size and socioeconomic diversity.\nTechnology has increasingly offered new media for youth who wish to\nvictimize their peers, sparking concern among policy makers, practitioners,\nand researchers. Technology offers perpetrators of bullying nearly universal\naccess to their victims through social media, text messaging, and other forms\nof online communication. Similarly, dating partners are able to better communicate\nwith each other through enhancements in technology, but as with\ne-bullying, dating partners also have new ways to exert control within relationships\nusing technology. Recent research has uncovered a notable relationship\nbetween e-bullying and electronic relationship violence (e-RV) among\nyouth. In a sample of 351 young adults, Hoff and Mitchell (2009) found that\ne-bullying often emerged as a result of relationship problems. Further\nresearch revealed that students who were e-bullied were 2 to 3 times as likely\nto also experience e-RV than those who were not e-bullied (Hinduja &\nPatchin, 2011; Zweig, Dank, Lachman, & Yahner, 2013). However, research\nhas yet to investigate whether victims of e-bullying are at greater risk of\nexperiencing pRV.\nTheoretical Frameworks\nNumerous theories have been used to help explain victimization from youth\nviolence. These theories focus on various levels of influence, ranging from\nthe individual to the interpersonal to the social environment. This study will\ndraw on the developmental victimization framework, which suggests that\nvictims of various forms of aggression share overlapping risk factors\n(Finkelhor & Asdigian, 1996; Finkelhor & Dziuba-Leatherman, 1994). This\nframework posits that once an individual is victimized, he or she begins to\nexhibit personality and behavioral characteristics that put him or her at risk\nfor future victimization. Others have invoked attribution theory to explain\nmultiple forms of victimization (Graham & Juvonen, 2001); victims of\naggression may attribute the victimization experience as an internal and\nuncontrollable characteristic. This self-blame may normalize future victimization\nexperiences, thereby putting individuals at risk for further\nvictimization.\n54 Journal of Interpersonal Violence 32(1)\nCertain demographic groups are at higher risk for stigmatization than others,\nwhich may put them at higher risk for joint victimization from bullying\nor e-bullying and pRV. According to social stress theory, individuals in stigmatized\nsocial groups are subjected to added stress due to their minority status\n(Meyer, 2003). Individuals of minority sexual orientations experience\nmore external stressful events, often in the form of bullying, than their peers.\nSimilarly, racial prejudice and discrimination have been described as a unique\nclass of stressors (Williams & Mohammed, 2009) because those in the racial\nmajority seek to maintain their socially superior status by degrading racial\nminorities through social and behavioral means. Increased victimization\nfrom bullying based on stigma and discrimination faced by minority youth\nmay increase their likelihood of attributing the experience as self-blame,\nthereby increasing their likelihood for future victimization.\nThis study will also investigate whether the relationship between bullying\nor e-bullying and pRV is found in this large population-based sample and\nwhether it remains after adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics,\nincluding sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, age, and gender. These covariates\nhave been shown in prior research to be associated with bullying, e-bullying,\nand pRV separately, suggesting potential confounding of the relationship\nbetween bullying and e-bullying with pRV. However, we are unaware of any\nstudies that assess these covariates as potential confounders when assessing\nthe intersection of bullying and e-bullying with pRV.\nSexual orientation plays a notable role in students\xe2\x80\x99 risk of peer victimization.\nThe National Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) from 2001 to 2009,\nwhich includes 41 states and 21 large urban school districts, has consistently\nshown that lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) youth are at greater risk of victimization\nfrom bullying than heterosexual youth (Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention [CDC], 2011). LGB youth are also at greater risk of\npRV. In a separate survey of more than 5,000 7th to 12th graders in New\nYork, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey, LGB youth reported much higher rates\nof victimization from all forms of relationship violence than heterosexual\nyouth, including pRV (42% vs. 29%, respectively), psychological dating\nabuse (59% vs. 46%), and cyber dating abuse (37% vs. 25%; Dank, Lachman,\nZweig, & Yahner, 2014). Zweig and colleagues (2013) highlight the need to\nfurther examine the overlap of cyberbullying and pRV, especially regarding\nLGB youth.\nRace/ethnicity has also been shown to be associated with pRV. According\nto the 2011 National YRBS, Black and Hispanic students report experiencing\npRV at higher rates than non-Hispanic White students (CDC, 2012). However,\nracial and ethnic differences in victimization from bullying have been studied\nto a lesser degree, and the few existing studies have produced conflicting \nPeters et al. 55\nresults. In a nationally representative sample of more than 11,000 students in\nGrades 6 to 10, African American students were less likely to be victimized\nby bullying than White and Hispanic students (Spriggs, Iannotti, Nansel, &\nHaynie, 2007). Other studies have shown similar rates of being bullied across\nracial groups (Estell, Farmer, & Cairns, 2007; Graham & Juvonen, 2002),\nand still others have shown higher rates of bullying victimization among\nAfrican American students compared with other racial/ethnic groups, particularly\nin urban settings (Goldweber, Waasdorp, & Bradshaw, 2013).\nSimilar to race/ethnicity, research on the role that gender plays in youths\xe2\x80\x99\nrisk of peer victimization has produced inconsistent results. A greater number\nof boys report being physically bullied than girls, and more girls report experiencing\nvictimization from verbal bullying, relational bullying (Crick &\nNelson, 2002; Seals & Young, 2003), and cyberbullying (21% vs. 12%) than\nboys (New York Statewide School Health Services Center [NYSSHSC],\n2013). Studies have reported different conclusions regarding gender and victimization\nfrom pRV, which is due in part to the way that pRV is defined in\nthe measures used (e.g., behavior vs. intent to harm or severity of harm). In a\nstudy of young women (15-24), they reported more frequently using physical\nviolence against their male partners that they reported receiving from the\nsame partner (Palmetto et al., 2013). In the 2011 National YRBS, boys\nreported experiencing more minor pRV than girls (CDC, 2012). However, in\na national survey of more than 20,000 students in predominantly rural communities,\ngirls reported experiencing more severe pRV than boys in each\nregion of the country (Marquart et al., 2007).\nDrawing on the above research, the purpose of this study is to examine the\nassociation between victimization from bullying and e-bullying with victimization\nfrom pRV among a large random, representative sample of public\nhigh school students in NYC. NYC is the largest city in the United States,\nwith a diverse mix of cultures and constant streams of migration and immigration\n(New York City Department of City Planning, 2013). Consequently,\nexisting research on the relationship between victimization from bullying/\ne-bullying with pRV may not generalize to urban youth in NYC. Furthermore,\nthis research will examine whether the intersection between bullying and\ne-bullying with pRV remains when accounting for sexual orientation, gender,\nrace/ethnicity, and age. This research seeks to answer the following\nquestions:\nResearch Question 1: Are students who report being bullied or e-bullied\nmore likely to also report experiencing pRV compared with students who\ndo not report being bullied or e-bullied?\n56 Journal of Interpersonal Violence 32(1)\nResearch Question 2: Does the association between bullying and\ne-bullying with pRV among NYC high school students remain significant\nafter controlling for gender, sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, and age?\nWe hypothesize the following:\nHypothesis 1: Students who are bullied or e-bullied will be more likely to\nalso report victimization from pRV than students who are not bullied or\ne-bullied.\nHypothesis 2: The association between bullying and e-bullying with pRV\nwill remain significant after adjusting for covariates of interest.\nBy empirically identifying the relationship between victimization from\nbullying/e-bullying with pRV in NYC, this research could help inform prevention\ninitiatives, response strategies, and youth aggression policies, specifically\nin urban schools.\nMethod\nNYC YRBS\nThis research analyzes data collected in the 2011 NYC YRBS. The YRBS\nmeasures demographics, environmental factors, experiences, and behaviors\nof public high school students in Grades 9 to 12 that potentially put them at\nrisk for numerous adverse health outcomes. The NYC Department of Health\nand Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) administers the YRBS biennially in collaboration\nwith the NYC Department of Education and the CDC. In 2011, about\n11,570 high school students from 102 schools completed the NYC YRBS\nwith school and student response rates of 93% and 79%, respectively, yielding\na 73% overall response rate (NYC DOHMH, 2012).\nSampling Procedure\nThe 2011 NYC DOHMH selected a representative sample of public high\nschool students for the YRBS using a two-stage cluster sample design. First,\nschools were randomly selected across the five boroughs of NYC. In the\nsecond stage of sampling, classrooms were selected from either a required\nsubject (i.e., social studies) or a required period (i.e., homeroom), mirroring\nthe final stage of the CDC\xe2\x80\x99s three-stage sampling methodology for the\nnational YRBS (CDC, 2012). Consequently, students who did not attend\nthese required classes because they were in non-mainstream programs were \nPeters et al. 57\nexcluded from the sampling frame, including students in English as Second\nLanguage (ESL) and special education programs. All assenting students in\nthe selected classrooms at selected schools anonymously completed the selfadministered\nquestionnaire. After data were collected, each student\xe2\x80\x99s\nresponses were weighted based on their probabilities of selection, nonresponse\nto questions, and other stratified adjustments. In addition to students\nwho were solely in ESL and special education classes, the YRBS survey\ndesign excluded students who attended private or charter schools, were\nabsent from school on the day of the questionnaire, had dropped out, or were\nincarcerated. More details on the survey and data set can be found at the NYC\nYRBS website (NYC DOHMH, 2012).\nMeasures\nDependent and predictor variables. The dependent variable of pRV was measured\nby the following YRBS item: \xe2\x80\x9cDuring the past 12 months, did your\nboyfriend or girlfriend ever hit, slap, or physically hurt you on purpose?\xe2\x80\x9d\nResponses were coded dichotomously. In a 1999 study of the test\xe2\x80\x93retest reliability\nof the YRBS, this pRV item received a kappa statistic of 56%, falling\nbetween the moderate (41%) to substantial (61%) range of reliability (Brener\net al., 2002).\nTwo exposure variables were included in this study: (a) victimization from\nbullying at school and (b) victimization from e-bullying. The former was\nmeasured using the item, \xe2\x80\x9cDuring the past 12 months, have you ever been\nbullied on school property?\xe2\x80\x9d The latter was measured using the item, \xe2\x80\x9cDuring\nthe past 12 months, have you ever been electronically bullied? (Include being\nbullied through e-mail, chat rooms, instant messaging, websites, or texting.)\xe2\x80\x9d\nResponses were coded dichotomously. In the 2011 YRBS, these two questions\nare prefaced with a short description of what constitutes bullying:\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhen one or more students tease, threaten, spread rumors about, hit, shove,\nor hurt another student repeatedly.\xe2\x80\x9d The questions were also prefaced with a\ndescription of what should not be considered bullying: \xe2\x80\x9cwhen two students of\nabout the same strength . . . argue, fight, or tease each other in a friendly\nway.\xe2\x80\x9d Test\xe2\x80\x93retest reliability has not been assessed as victimization from bullying\nand e-bullying were added to the NYC YRBS in 2009 (CDC, 2013).\nCovariates. Several demographic covariates were considered when investigating\nthe intersection of victimization from bullying and e-bullying with\npRV, including gender, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, age, and grade.\nGender was defined as male and female in the YRBS. The NYC YRBS\nincludes separate items for ethnicity and race: (a) \xe2\x80\x9cAre you Hispanic or \n58 Journal of Interpersonal Violence 32(1)\nLatino?\xe2\x80\x9d and (b) \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your race?\xe2\x80\x9d Participants could choose multiple\nresponses for race, which included American Indian or Alaska Native; Asian;\nBlack or African American; Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander; and\nWhite. In this study, race was grouped into five categories, which were White,\nBlack/African American, Hispanic/Latino, Asian, and other (which included\nAmerican Indian/Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian/other Pacific Islander, and\nmultiple non-Hispanic due to their low frequencies in the sample). Grade was\nmeasured as 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, and \xe2\x80\x9cungraded/other\xe2\x80\x9d grades, and age was\nmeasured as 12 or younger, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18 years or older. Sexual\norientation was defined using the YRBS item, \xe2\x80\x9cHow would you describe\nyourself?\xe2\x80\x9d with responses of straight/heterosexual, gay/lesbian, bisexual, and\nunsure. In this study, respondents who reported being unsure (n = 372) were\nanalyzed separately from lesbian/gay, bisexual, and heterosexual respondents,\nconsistent with current recommendations (Badgett & Goldberg, 2009).\nStatistical Analysis\nDescriptive statistics were calculated using frequencies for the \xe2\x80\x9cbullied at\nschool,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ce-bullied,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpRV\xe2\x80\x9d variables to determine the prevalence of students\nexperiencing each form of violence. The prevalence of these variables\nwas also disaggregated by gender, race/ethnicity, sexual identity, grade, and\nage to investigate which demographic groups reported the highest rates of\nyouth victimization by bullying, e-bullying, and pRV separately. As shown in\nTable 1, the small number of students who reported being 12 years or younger\n(n = 36) and being in \xe2\x80\x9canother grade\xe2\x80\x9d or ungraded (n = 64) had very different\nvictimization experiences from bullying, e-bullying, and pRV than their fellow\nstudents. Given the small sample sizes of these two groups and their\nnotably different experiences from that of the others, we excluded them in all\nsubsequent analyses.\nChi-square tests were performed to explore the relationship between each\nof the bullying variables (\xe2\x80\x9cbullied on school property\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ce-bullied\xe2\x80\x9d) and\nthe pRV variable to assess the unadjusted odds of being both bullied or e-bullied\nand physically abused by a dating partner. After the unadjusted relationships\nwere defined, adjusted estimates were calculated through logistic\nregression. The correlation between bullied and e-bullied (\xcf\x86 coefficient =\n0.35) fell between a medium (0.3) and large (0.5) effect size (Pallant, 2010),\nand therefore \xe2\x80\x9cbullied at school\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ce-bullied\xe2\x80\x9d were assessed in separate\nmodels. The first model included being bullied at school as the predictor variable\nand the second included being e-bullied as the predictor variable. Each\nlogistic regression model also included covariates that were significantly\nassociated with both the predictors (bullied and e-bullied) and the outcome \n59\nTable 1.

Respondents were fairly\nevenly distributed across the grade levels, with 28% in the 9th grade, 26% in\nthe 10th, 24% in the 11th, and 22% in 12th. Most respondents reported that\nthey were straight/heterosexual (86%), with 2.8% identifying as gay/lesbian,\n7.2% as bisexual, and 3.8% of respondents reporting that they were \xe2\x80\x9cunsure\xe2\x80\x9d\nof their sexual orientation. More than 90% of respondents were between the\nages of 13 and 17 (Table 1).\nGirls and boys reported being bullied at similar rates (Table 1), but more\ngirls reported being e-bullied than boys (12.7% vs. 8.7%; p < .001).\nConversely, boys reported victimization from pRV at higher rates than girls\n(11.1% vs. 9.4%; p = .004). Significant group differences were observed\nbetween gay/lesbian, bisexual, and unsure adolescents compared with heterosexual/straight\nadolescents. A higher percentage of gay/lesbian (18.6% bullied,\n19.9% e-bullied, 25.3% pRV; p < .001), bisexual (17.1% bullied, 18.9%\ne-bullied, 18.1% pRV; p < .001), and students who were unsure of their sexual\norientation (17% bullied, 17.5% e-bullied, 14.9% pRV; p < .001) reported\nvictimization from bullying, e-bullying, and pRV compared with straight/\nheterosexual students (10.6% bullied, 9.8% e-bullied, 8.5% pRV). More\nWhite students reported being bullied and e-bullied than Black, Hispanic,\nand Asian students. Fewer White and Asian students reported pRV than Black\nand Hispanic students (7.3%, 6.6%, 9%, and 10.8%, respectively; p < .001).\nNext, cross-tabulations were performed to assess the prevalence, and odds\nratios were calculated of reporting pRV as well as being bullied at school or\ne-bullied in the last 12 months (Table 2). In the last 12 months, 11.7% reported\nbeing bullied on school property, 11% reported being e-bullied, and 10.4%\nreported being physically abused by a boyfriend or girlfriend. Of the students\nwho reported being bullied in school in the past 12 months, 19.2% also reported\nbeing victims of pRV equating to 2.5 times the odds (95% CI [2.1, 2.9]) of also\nbeing victimized by pRV compared with those who were not bullied. Similarly,\nof the students who reported being e-bullied in the past 12 months, 21.9% also\nreported being victims of pRV, equating to 3 times the odds (95% CI [2.6, 3.5])\nof reporting victimization from pRV than peers who were not e-bullied. \n62\nTable 2.

In addition, this research is among the first to address potential\nconfounding by gender, sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, and age on joint\nvictimization from bullying and e-bullying with pRV. The findings from this\nstudy add to the overall understanding of bullying, e-bullying, and pRV,\nshowing that victimization from bullying and e-bullying is strongly associated\nwith pRV. The main findings of this research can be summarized in three\nmain points.\nFirst, victimization from bullying, e-bullying, and pRV affects a substantial\nportion of NYC students. Univariate analyses were mostly consistent\nwith published literature, showing that certain populations were significantly\nmore likely to experience bullying, e-bullying, or RV separately. Similar to\npublished literature (CDC, 2011; Dank et al., 2014), LGB students and students\nwho were unsure of their sexual orientation had higher rates of all three\nforms of aggression than their heterosexual peers. Also consistent with published\nliterature (CDC, 2012), Black and Hispanic/Latino students reported\nexperiencing more relationship violence than students.\nBullying and e-bullying tended to decrease with age and grade whereas\npRV tended to increase with age and grade, though the associations persisted\ndespite the differing age trends. In this study, Black students reported lower\nrates of being bullied and e-bullied than White and Hispanic students, differing\nfrom recent findings that Black students are at higher risk of being bullied\n(Goldweber et al., 2013). The sample in the study by Goldweber and colleagues\nwas predominantly White (62.4%), whereas the sample in this study\nwas predominantly Black and Hispanic (27% and 26%, respectively), which\nmay have led to these discrepant findings.\nThe second main finding shows that students who are bullied or e-bullied\nhave much higher odds (ORs of 2.5 and 3.0, respectively) of victimization\nfrom pRV compared with those who have not been bullied or e-bullied. These\nfindings regarding bullying and pRV co-occurrence support the limited prior\nresearch (Espelage & Holt, 2007; Yahner et al., 2015). In addition, the findings\nregarding the co-occurrence of e-bullying and pRV provide new insights\ninto teen violence, and complement findings that show significant co-occurrence\nof e-bullying with a different outcome of e-dating violence (Hinduja &\nPatchin, 2011). Although there is significant overlap in victimization from\nthese three forms of youth aggression, a majority of students who report any\nvictimization still only report being victimized by a single form: either bullied,\ne-bullied, or victimized by pRV.\nThe third major finding of this research shows that the relationship\nbetween being bullied or e-bullied with victimization from pRV remained\nessentially unchanged and still significant after adjusting for race, gender, \n66 Journal of Interpersonal Violence 32(1)\nsexual orientation, and age. The lack of confounding in the present study suggests\nthat once students experience victimization from bullying or e-bullying,\ntheir odds of victimization from pRV are higher regardless of their sociodemographic\ncharacteristics.\nImplications for Policy and Practice\nNearly all states have enacted bullying legislation, with 31 states specifically\naddressing e-bullying (National Conference of State Legislatures, 2014a,\n2014b). Evaluations of anti-bullying policies have shown protective effects\nagainst adverse health outcomes, especially those policies that include sexual-orientation-specific\nlanguage, for specific subpopulations (i.e., lesbian\nand gay youth; Hatzenbuehler & Keyes, 2013). States have increasingly\nimplemented anti-dating violence policies in schools. As of January 2014, 21\nstates (excluding New York) have introduced legislation that requires schools\nto incorporate information on pRV into their curricula (National Conference\nof State Legislatures, 2014c), yet most pRV policies in schools are separate\nfrom bullying policies. School policies that address bullying, e-bullying, and\npRV jointly may help address the intersection of bullying and e-bullying with\npRV. Rhode Island has innovatively integrated dating violence policies into\nexisting school bullying policies. Rhode Island passed a law requiring each\nschool to draft a dating violence policy that includes teacher and staff trainings\nand age-appropriate dating violence curricula for students in Grades 7 to\n12. However, rather than creating a separate policy to address RV in schools,\nRhode Island expanded the existing bullying and e-bullying policy to include\nthese new dating violence training and education mandates (Rhode Island\nDepartment of Education, 2012). Combining policy and programmatic\napproaches in schools might provide economies of scale but, to our knowledge,\nthis combined policy has yet to be evaluated for efficacy, and we recommend\na rigorous evaluation to inform further enactment of joint or separate\nbullying/e-bullying and pRV school policies. Expanding current efforts into a\ncomprehensive school aggression policy may enable schools to feasibly\nstreamline reporting and investigation protocols as well as prevention efforts.\nThe effects of comprehensive policies need to be empirically validated\nthrough future evaluation.\nIn addition to policy-level approaches, interventions and programs can be\npursued that address bullying and pRV jointly. Researchers have suggested\nthat prevention interventions focus on multiple domains of aggression,\nincluding bullying and pRV if, in fact, they do co-occur (Ozer, Tschann,\nPasch, & Flores, 2004). The findings from this research support this view.\nInterventions addressing multiple domains of aggression have shown \nPeters et al. 67\npositive results in preventing youth violence and the associated long-term\nhealth outcomes. To reduce pRV, Safe Spaces chose to intervene early in\nelementary school through a bullying and sexual harassment prevention program\nwith the belief that tolerating violence early in childhood allows children\nthe freedom to perpetrate bullying and pRV later in adolescence (Sanchez\net al., 2001). Students in intervention schools had increased knowledge\nrelated to sexual harassment, better recognition of bullying at school, and\nincreased willingness to intervene as bystanders compared with students in\ncomparison schools. Espelage, Low, Polanin, and Brown (2013) recently\nimplemented and evaluated a similar intervention among middle schools in\nthe Midwest (Illinois and Kansas) to reduce youth aggression and sexual violence.\nPreliminary results showed decreased physical aggression in intervention\nschools compared with control schools (Espelage et al., 2013). Other\ninterventions have been described that seek to address both bullying and pRV\namong students (Fredland, 2010) and promote healthy relationships among\npeers and dating partners (Wolfe et al., 2009). Despite implementation challenges\nand a lack of preliminary outcomes, these interventions used novel\nprevention approaches for multiple domains of aggression that should be\nrevisited, adapted, and improved in other settings.\nFuture Research\nThis research focused solely on individual-level risk factors of victimization\nfrom bullying, e-bullying, and pRV. Future research should investigate potential\nenvironmental and community factors that increase students\xe2\x80\x99 risk of joint\nvictimization from bullying, e-bullying, and pRV, such as family violence,\ncommunity violence, and school climate. Also, studies of the intersection of\nbullying and e-bullying with pRV should investigate perpetration in addition\nto victimization, given that students who are victimized by bullying, e-bullying,\nand pRV often also perpetrate these forms of aggression (Swearer et al.,\n2001). The YRBS does not include questions on other important aspects of\nrelationship violence, given that dating aggression also includes sexual coercion\nand also occurs through the use of technology. In addition, research has\nyet to investigate whether students who experience joint victimization from\nthese three forms of aggression experience different or more severe adverse\nhealth outcomes. Health outcomes specific to joint victimization should be a\nfocus of future research.\nTemporal causality cannot be inferred about the relationship between victimization\nfrom bullying/e-bullying and pRV due to the cross-sectional nature\nof the NYC YRBS. Future research should utilize a longitudinal design that\nassesses perpetration and victimization of bullying, e-bullying, and pRV, \n68 Journal of Interpersonal Violence 32(1)\nallowing for a better understanding of the development of these forms of\ncoercion over time. The bullying\xe2\x80\x93sexual violence pathway that has been proposed\nin the literature suggests that bullying begins very early in childhood\n(Espelage et al., 2012). Therefore, longitudinal studies should begin with\nchildren early in their schooling to gain a detailed understanding of this\npathway.\nLimitations and Strengths\nThere are limitations to this study regarding sampling and measurement.\nThese findings only represent public high school students in NYC and are not\ngeneralizable to behaviors of students who attend private and charter schools,\nare home schooled, or do not attend school. LGB students are more likely to\nstay home from school due to fear of victimization than heterosexual students\n(Robinson & Espelage, 2012), potentially reducing their participation in this\nsurvey. The level of sampling bias created by the differential exclusion of\nstudents who were frequent school absentees cannot be determined from the\ndata available in the NYC YRBS.\nIn addition, victimization from bullying, e-bullying, and pRV were all\nmeasured by single questions. Each of these forms of aggression comprises a\ncomplex set of behaviors, mentalities, and circumstances. Using single-item\nmeasures may miss the nuanced complexities of perceived bullying, e-bullying,\nand pRV. This narrow operationalization could threaten the content\nvalidity of this study by differentially representing or misrepresenting the\nconstructs of bullying, e-bullying, and pRV. In a recent review of pRV among\nteenagers, surveys that used multi-item scales consistently reported prevalence\nrates of pRV at 20% to 25% of the survey population, whereas studies\nthat relied on the single-item scale in the YRBS reported half the prevalence\nrates (Stonard et al., 2014). This suggests that YRBS measures underrepresent\nthe constructs of bullying, e-bullying, and pRV. In addition, this study\nwas unable to assess perpetration, severity, or frequency of victimization, and\nother forms of RV, including sexual and psychological RV. Last, the NYC\nYRBS relies on self-report data from high school students about their behaviors,\nexperiences, and identities. Self-reports in self-administered surveys\nintroduce the possibility of numerous forms of biases (Podsakoff & Organ,\n1986). However, self-reported measures of bullying victimization are found\nto be preferable to peer and teacher nomination when the purpose of the study\nis to assess the experiences of all students in a given school (Espelage &\nSwearer, 2003).\nDespite these limitations, this research has many design attributes that\nbolster the strength of the findings. The NYC YRBS uses a large, random \nPeters et al. 69\nsample of urban high school students from diverse backgrounds and neighborhoods.\nThis research provides a solid foundation for practitioners and\npolicy makers to rethink programmatic and policy strategies, as well as\ndirecting future research into joint victimization of bullying and dating\nviolence.\nConclusion\nVictimization from bullying (both at school and electronic) and pRV significantly\nco-occur among high school students in NYC after controlling for\nrace/ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, or age. These experiences undoubtedly\naffect students in adverse ways. Although further research is needed on\njoint victimization that includes joint perpetration and the direction of temporal\ncausation, policy makers, practitioners, and school administrators should\nconsider the findings of this research, within the existing state of the literature,\nto strategically combine resources for bullying, e-bullying, and pRV\nprevention and intervention.\nEthical Standards\nThe Columbia University Medical Center Institutional Review Board\napproved this secondary analysis as exempt (Protocol IRB-AAM5806).\nAcknowledgments\nGratitude must first be extended to the NYC Network for Healthy Teen Relationships\nfor providing the inspiration for this practice-based research.

aS'Sexual Harassment in Middle and High School Children and Effects on Physical and Mental Health\n\nAbstract\nSexual harassment can be physical interaction and touching, as well as, psychological, environmental, or via Internet and text messaging. An online survey in an urban clinic asked children, aged 12 to 18 years the following: demographic\ndata, height and weight, chronic medical conditions, healthcare use, questions concerning sexual harassment\xe2\x80\x94witnessed and exposure, and finally questions from the Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PSC-35). Overall, 124 of 210\n(59%) of the 12- to 18-year-olds surveyed had experienced sexual harassment, with the predominance being female\n69% (80/116) versus 48% (49/92) male. Participants who had experienced sexual harassment were significantly\nmore likely to score positive for psychological impairment than those who had not experienced sexual harassment\n(chi-square test P < .001; odds ratio: 4.7 (95% confidence interval, 1.9-11.8). There was a borderline significant\nassociation between elevated body mass index and having experienced sexual harassment (2-sample t test P = .08).\nSexual harassment has a direct correlation to psychological impairment in adolescents, especially females.\nKeywords\nsexual harassment, adolescent, mental health\nDefining sexual harassment can be challenging, since it\nis not only considered physical face-to-face interaction\nand touching, it can be psychological, environmental,\nand via Internet and text messaging.1\n Since there is no\nuniversal definition and sexual harassment has commonly\nbeen paired with bullying, widely variable rates\nof sexual harassment have occurred across studies. In a\nrecent national survey done by telephone in the United\nStates in 2011, the respondents of youths aged (10-13\nyears) and (14-17 years) had experienced sexual harassment\nin the past year at rates of 2.8% and 9.3% respectively.2\n However, in studies directly surveying children\nand adolescents from fifth grade throughout high\nschool, who were asked if they experienced some form\nof sexual harassment within the past 2 weeks or ever,\nthe reported rates of sexual harassment varied anywhere\nfrom 15% to 81%.3-5\nSome studies have shown females to be much more\nlikely to experience sexual harassment, and other studies\nhave shown males and females to have an equal likelihood\nof experiencing sexual harassment.2,5 Gender\ndifferences in how a student might experience sexual\nharassment have been noted. Females are likely to experience\nbelittlement and objectification because of their\nsex, whereas males experience vulgar and homophobic\ncomments.6,7 Youth with more advanced pubertal status\nare also more likely than their less advanced peers to be\nvictims of harassment.7,8\nDespite the frequency and awareness of sexual\nharassment, there is little research found in the pediatric\nliterature concerning the longitudinal mental and physical\nhealth effects on both male and females as they progress\nthrough school. Goldstein et al8\n reported that sexual\nharassment in eighth grade predicted increased problems\nwith substance use, lower self-esteem, and symptoms\nof depression 3 years later. It has also been reported\nthat sexual harassment can increase school absences,\nworsen academic performance, and create mental stress\nleading to mental health problems.9\n In addition, sexual\nharassment can increase an adolescent\xe2\x80\x99s preoccupation\nwith appearance and thus increase the risk of developing\neating disorders.10 Chiodo et al11 reported on multiple\n553430 CPJXXX10.1177/0009922814553430Clinical PediatricsEom et al\nresearch-article2014\n1\nEastern Virginia Medical School, Norfolk, VA, USA\n2\nChildren\xe2\x80\x99s Hospital of The King\xe2\x80\x99s Daughters, Norfolk, VA, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nJohn W.

There was a borderline significant\nassociation between elevated body mass index and having experienced sexual harassment (2-sample t test P = .08).\nSexual harassment has a direct correlation to psychological impairment in adolescents, especially females.\nKeywords\nsexual harassment, adolescent, mental health\nEom et al 431\npsychosomatic parameters in their longitudinal study\nutilizing 12 items from the depression and anxiety subscales\nof the Brief Symptom Inventory.12 Their study\nshowed strong correlations with sexual harassment and\nemotional distress, self-harming behaviors, and suicidal\nideation.\nAlthough studies have focused on psychosomatic\ncomplaints related to sexual harassment, few have\nlooked directly at physical complaints or ailments. It has\nbeen shown that students who are bullied, perhaps a\nproxy for sexual harassment, can be affected by poor\nphysical health. This can be manifested by a variety of\nsymptoms including headache, backache, abdominal\npain, skin problems, sleeping problems, bed-wetting,\nand dizziness.13-17 Some schools consider sexual harassment\nas a form of bullying.18,19 Distinguishing between\nthe 2 terms is important because they have different\ndefinitions and therefore may not have similar longitudinal\noutcomes.\nSexual harassment, for our purposes, will be defined\nas unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature which can\ninclude unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual\nfavors, or other verbal, nonverbal, or physical conduct\nof a sexual nature.20,21 This study seeks to specifically\nlook at sexual harassment in the teenager age population\nby (1) assessing the prevalence of sexual harassment\namongst adolescents, who present for well and sick care\nat a General Academic Pediatric practice, in a predominantly\nurban African American population and (2) determining\nwhether exposure to sexual harassment correlates\nwith psychological impairment on the Pediatric\nSymptom Checklist-35\xe2\x80\x93Youth Report (Y-PSC-35), and\n(3) if exposure to sexual harassment has any effect on\noverall body mass index (BMI), increased listing of\nchronic illnesses, or increased health care utilization.\nMethods\nThis study applied a questionnaire to adolescents in the\nclinic setting to investigate their experiences with sexual\nharassment at school and outside of school.\nSurvey Population\nParticipants were patients between the ages of 12 and 18\nyears, scheduled for a well or sick visit in the General\nAcademic Pediatrics practice located on the main floor\nof the Children\xe2\x80\x99s Hospital of The King\xe2\x80\x99s Daughters, in\nNorfolk, Virginia. The patient population is predominantly\nAfrican American (85%) with Medicaid or\nMedicaid managed care as their primary insurance.\nParticipation required both\xe2\x80\x94consent from parent or\nlegal guardian and assent from the adolescent.\nDevelopment of the Survey\nThe online survey tool SurveyMonkey was used to create\nthe questionnaire used in this study. We included questions\non demographic data (age, sex, grade, and ethnicity);\nheight and weight; questions on chronic medical\nconditions and on the use of health care; questions about\nthe frequency of sexual harassment witnessed; questions\nconcerning exposure to sexual harassment from\nAmerican Association of University Women,20 and 35\nquestions from the Y-PSC-35.22 A copy of the full survey\nis available on request. Psychological impairment was\ndefined as any score \xe2\x89\xa5 30 on the Y-PSC-35. Participants\nwere defined as having experienced sexual harassment\nif they reported \xe2\x80\x9crare\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9coccasional\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9coften\xe2\x80\x9d, or \xe2\x80\x9cvery\noften\xe2\x80\x9d occurrences of at least 1 of the following: (1) I\nhave been the target of sexual comments, jokes, teasing,\ngestures, or looks; (2) I have had my clothing pulled in a\nsexual way; (3) I have had sexual rumors spread about\nme; (4) I have had my way blocked in a sexual way; (5)\nI have been touched, grabbed, or pinched in a sexual\nway; or (6) I have been shown or given sexual pictures,\nphotographs, illustrations, messages, or notes.\nSurvey Administration\nWe collected data over 2 time periods\xe2\x80\x94from June 2012\nthrough August 2012 and from April 2013 through June\n2013. An additional question concerning how the participant\nhandles exposure to sexual harassment via electronic\nand social media was included in the second time\nperiod. Participants completed the survey in the clinic at\nthe time of their medical appointment using an iPad provided\nby the researcher. The research assistant reviewed\nall the patients scheduled for the day in the General\nAcademic Pediatric outpatient area and identified adolescents\nthat met the study inclusion criteria as they\nwere being triaged. Once the patient was placed in a\nroom, the research assistant entered and explained to the\npatient and parent/guardian that they are recruiting the\nadolescent for an anonymous survey that will ask questions\nconcerning their experiences with sexual harassment\nat school and outside of school. Once the parent/\nguardian consented and the adolescent assented to the\nstudy, the survey software was explained and the survey\nwas completed by the adolescent. A research team member\nwas present to ensure software functionality and\nensure that there was no parental input in answering the\nsurvey questions. After the final question was completed,\nthe participant alerted the assistant and the connection\nto SurveyMonkey was discontinued (generally\nthis occurred automatically, but was confirmed by the\nassistant).\n432 Clinical Pediatrics 54(5)\nStatistical Analysis\nThe data were analyzed using SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute,\nCary, NC) and SPSS 19 (IBM, Armonk, NY) software.\nDescriptive statistics were reported for the survey\nresponses, and unknown or missing values were excluded\nfrom the analysis. P values less than .05 were considered\nstatistically significant. Comparisons of means between\ngroups were performed using 2-sample t tests. Proportions\nwere compared using chi-square or Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s exact tests,\nwhere appropriate. A logistic regression model for having\nexperienced sexual harassment assessed the significance\nof the relationship with psychological impairment\nafter adjusting for school level, gender, ethnicity, BMI,\nchronic illness, and health care utilization.\nResults\nDemographics and Medical Conditions\nOf the 238 patients approached, 210 (88%) agreed to\nparticipate in this study. Data was not collected on the\n27 patients who did not participate. Approximately\n89% of the patients surveyed were African American or\nmultiracial and most were currently in high school\n(Table 1). Asthma and allergies were the most common\nmedical conditions indicated by participants and the\nmost common interval to visit a doctor was every 6\nmonths (Table 2).\nPsychological Impairment\nOverall, 39 participants (18.6%) had psychological\nimpairment as measured by the Y-PSC-35. After excluding\nparticipants with ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity\ndisorder), 33 of the 191 participants without ADHD\n(17.3%) had psychological impairment (Table 3).\nSexual Harassment\nIn response to the question \xe2\x80\x9cHow much do you think\nsexual harassment happens in your school?\xe2\x80\x9d, 57 (27.5%)\nsaid \xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen,\xe2\x80\x9d 73 (35.3%) said \xe2\x80\x9cIt happens to\nonly a few people,\xe2\x80\x9d 38 (18.4%) said \xe2\x80\x9cIt happens to a fair\nnumber of people,\xe2\x80\x9d and 39 (18.8%) said \xe2\x80\x9cIt goes on all\nthe time\xe2\x80\x9d (Table 4).

One hundred\ntwenty-four (59.6%) reported that they had experienced\nsexual harassment. More specifically, 44 of 92 males\n(47.8%) and 80 of 116 females (69.0%) had experienced\nsexual harassment. Females were statistically significantly\nmore likely to have experienced sexual harassment\nthan males (chi-square test P = .002; odds ratio\n[OR] = 2.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.4-4.3;\nFigure 1).

Conversely, the Y-PSC-35\nsymptoms were not made worse by the combination of\nADHD with sexual harassment (Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s exact test, all P\n> .05), but this negative finding is most likely because of\na lack of power given the small number of subjects with\nADHD (n = 19).

There was\na borderline statistically significant association between\nBMI and having experienced sexual harassment (2-sample\nt test P = .08). Ninety of 143 participants (62.9%)\nwith a chronic disease had experienced sexual harassment,\nand 34 of 65 participants (52.3%) without a\nchronic disease had experienced sexual harassment.\nThere was, however, no association between having a\nchronic illness (or each individual illness) and having\nexperienced sexual harassment (chi-square or Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s\nexact test, all P >.05). In addition, there was no association\nbetween health care utilization and having experienced\nsexual harassment (chi-square test P =.37).\nDiscussion\nOur study demonstrates that females in middle and high\nschool are more likely to be sexually harassed than\nmales. Although recent studies have shown equal sexual\nharassment in males and females,11our study mirrors\nmany of the findings in Goldstein et al8\n and Nadeem et\nal,23 where African American females were more likely\nto be harassed and more likely to have negative psychological\noutcomes from exposure. This current study also\nsuggests that there may be differences in the pattern of\nsexual harassment based on a child\xe2\x80\x99s ethnicity and\nsocioeconomic class.\nOur study reinforces the fact that exposure to sexual\nharassment can affect the emotional well-being of a\nchild. The data clearly show a correlation for adolescents\nwho experienced sexual harassment to be more\nlikely to have a positive score on the Y-PSC-35.\nAlthough the Y-PSC-35 is not a screen that can provide\nan avenue to a specific diagnosis, data from previous\nstudies show that 67% of children or adolescents with a\npositive score will have a moderate to severe impairment\nin psychosocial functioning with the other 33%\nwith a positive score having at least a mild impairment,\nand all would likely benefit from more specific mental\nhealth testing.24,25\nAlthough the mean BMI had SD that overlapped for\nthose who had experienced sexual harassment (25.22 \xc2\xb1\n6.46) and those who had not experienced sexual harassment\n(23.74 \xc2\xb1 4.99), there was a borderline statistically significant\nassociation with the 2-sample t test yielding a P\nvalue of .08. This may be related to the possibility that\nfemales who are heavier may have started their pubertal\ngrowth spurts earlier and this may have made them targets\nfor harassment, or perhaps after being harassed they may\nhave been more likely to eat for comfort from being emotionally\ndistraught. There does not appear to be any correlation\nwith sexual harassment and any chronic underlying\nFigure 1. Student responses to whether they had\nexperienced sexual harassment stratified by gender (N = 208).\n436 Clinical Pediatrics 54(5)\nillnesses such as ADHD, diabetes, or asthma. There also\ndid not appear to be an increased use of health care via\nmore primary care visits, emergency department, or subspecialty\nvisits. Interestingly, the question added in our second\nwave of data collection concerning, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat action taken\nafter you were harassed?\xe2\x80\x9d approximately two thirds of the\nrespondents answered \xe2\x80\x9cnothing\xe2\x80\x9d and only 25% spoke with\na parent, teacher, or counselor (Table 6).\nLimitations\nThere is no preassessment data prior to middle school to\ndetermine if symptoms verified by the Y-PSC-35 existed\nprior to middle school. Correlation does not always\nmean causation, and children who are harassed may be\npreyed upon because of existing psychological disorders.\nOur data may not be generalizable because it is\nonly from one primary care office but does provide\nintriguing data that could be replicated in a larger study.\nUnfortunately, our health indicators and health care utilization\nwere by report and could not accurately be\ncross-referenced to the personal medical records in the\nstudy. There was 88% participation; however data was\nnot collected on the 28 patients who did not participate.\nIt is impossible to predict if they did not participate\nbecause they were concerned about talking about previous\nharassment or if they would have been less likely to\nhave been victims of sexual harassment. Obviously\nthere is overlap between bullying, physical intimidation,\nand sexual harassment. We did not collect data on specific\nantibullying campaigns within the schools that the\nparticipants\xe2\x80\x99 attended and this may have affected overall\nprevalence and recall, since some data was collected\nduring the school year and some was collected during\nTable 5.

Although it did not reach statistical significance,\nthere was an elevated BMI in children who had\nbeen sexually harassed; however, no other chronic disease\nor health care utilization appears to be effected in\nour cohort. The plausible relationship between elevated\nBMI and sexual harassment should be studied further. In\naddition, children who were harassed were not likely to\ndo or say anything about that harassment. Pediatricians\ntherefore should ask specific questions about sexual\nharassment during their adolescent health care visits\ncommonly known as the HEADDSS (Home, Education/\nEmployment, Activities, Diet, Drugs, Sexuality, and\nSuicide/Depression) assessment.27 If questions concerning\nsexual harassment are affirmative, then the physician\nshould consider further screening for mental health\nand/or psychosomatic concerns.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research,\nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\n1.

aS"PEER VICTIMIZATION WITHIN THE ETHNIC CONTEXT OF HIGH SCHOOL\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nRisk for peer victimization varies by ethnicity, but few studies explore how the\nethnic context of the school can affect this. Using a large sample of schools\nand high school students, we used hierarchical linear modeling to explore\nvictimization risk by ethnicity within the ethnic context of the school. Models\npredicted total, physical, verbal, and sexual harassment victimization. At the\nstudent level, the model included sex, ethnicity, and the percent of same\nethnicity students at the school. At the school level, the model included\ndiversity, mean perception of school safety, and mean perception that they\nwere targeted because of their race/ethnicity. At the student level, having more\nsame-ethnicity peers, and at the school level, having greater overall diversity,\ndecreased victimization. Overall, the results support the use of prevention\nand intervention efforts targeted at students. C 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\nSchools are a microcosm of society and can reflect societal attitudes about aggression, race\nrelations, and diversity. A significant minority of youth is victimized by their peers\nbecause of race, ethnicity, or immigration status (for a review, see Scherr & Larson, 2010),\nand the individual and contextual factors that affect this need empirical study to guide\nintervention and prevention efforts. However, youth can experience ethnicity-related\nvictimization from both same and different ethnicity peers (Scherr & Larson). Likewise, if\nchildren mainly associate with same ethnicity peers, they may experience as much or\nmore general victimization by same-ethnicity peers than by different ethnicity peers.\nThis work was partially supported by the Hankuk University of Foreign Studies Research Fund to\nSukkyung You.\nCorrespondence to: Erika D.

DOI: 10.1002/jcop.20465\nPrior research has suggested there may be an \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98in-group\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 bias, where people\nprefer members of their own group compared with those of other groups (Brewer,\n1979). This has been applied to studies of ethnicity and peer victimization (e.g., Hanish\n& Guerra, 2000a). Young children prefer and have a more positive view of children of\nthe same ethnicity (e.g., Aboud, 2003), however this tends to dissipate over time as\nchildren become better able to separate the individual from their group identification\n(Doyle & Aboud, 1995). Greater intergroup contact, such as having cross-ethnic\nfriendships, can help reduce prejudice (Pettigrew, 1998), and this is more likely at\nschools with greater diversity (Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006). Indeed, when presented with\nambiguous pictures of social situations with minority peers, White children attending\nethnically homogenous schools were more likely to hold negative opinions of the\nminority peer and rate friendship as less likely than in a similar study with White\nstudents attending a ethnically diverse school (McGlothlin & Killen, 2006). Thus, the\nrelation between ethnicity and victimization can be informed by the school context in\nwhich the child develops and socializes. A brief review of ethnicity, peer victimization,\nand the school context follows.\nTrends in Ethnicity and Peer Victimization\nResearch on trends in victimization and ethnicity show inconsistent patterns, as various\nstudies have used different definitions of violence and victimization, measures, and\nsamples (Felix, Furlong, & Austin, 2009). For example, victimization risk by ethnicity\nmay depend on the type of victimization (e.g., Finkelhor, Ormrod, Turner, & Hamby,\n2005). Other differences may be because of differences between samples and operational\ndefinitions of victimization. For example, one research program finds Latino students at\nlowest risk of peer victimization (e.g., Hanish & Guerra, 2000a,b), whereas another finds\nLatino students at higher risk than White students, but lower than African American\n(e.g., Baker, Mednick, & Carothers, 1989). Consequently, much remains to be known\nabout the potentially complex relation between ethnicity and peer victimization and this\ncan be informed by nationally representative and/or population-based studies.\nUsing a nationally representative survey, Spriggs, Iannotti, Nansel, and Haynie\n(2007) found that African Americans had lower rates of bullying victimization (a more\nsevere subtype of peer victimization based on chronicity and the existence of a power\nimbalance) than White and Latino/a youth. This study used a global definition of\nbullying, with only one item representing victimization, which means they were unable to\nexamine ethnic trends in different subtypes of youth victimization. In addition, another\nlimitation of the extant literature is that most studies of peer victimization or bullying\ncannot perform separate analyses on Asian American and Native American students\nbecause of their small sample size. Thus, little is known on their victimization risk.\nPrior research using the large, diverse California Healthy Kids Survey (CHKS)\ndataset began to address some questions on ethnic trends in school victimization\n(Felix et al., 2009). The CHKS survey is mandated for schools receiving federal\nfunds and represents 94% of California schools with enrollment in Grades 7, 9, and 11.\nThis study found more similarities than differences in rates of victimization across\nethnicities. Ethnic groups were similar in their rank ordering of the most to least\ncommon victimization types. Overall, victimization rates for Asian Americans were\nsimilar or lower than that of the total sample. But, for Native Americans, the rates\nwere similar or higher, indicating greater risk for victimization. This supports prior\nresearch that highlighted the disproportionately high rates of victimization among\nVictimization and Ethnic Context  861\nJournal of Community Psychology DOI: 10.1002/jcop\nNative Americans (Stevens, Ruggiero, Kilpatrick, Resnick, & Saunders, 2005).\nHowever, this study did not look at how victimization by ethnicity may be influenced\nby the school\xe2\x80\x99s ethnic composition or the percent of same-ethnicity peers within the\nschool. This is important to understand because victimization targeting an unchangeable\ncharacteristic, like race / ethnicity, can possibly increase risk of feeling helpless or\nhopeless, or lower self-esteem (Verkuyten & Thijs, 2006)\nEthnic Context and Peer Victimization\nVictimization rates for ethnic groups may depend on the ethnic context of schools.\nPrior research has begun to address the ethnic context of peer victimization at the\nschool or classroom-level among elementary and middle school students (Bellmore,\nWitkow, Graham, & Juvonen, 2004; Graham & Juvonen, 2002; Hanish & Guerra,\n2000a; Juvonen, Nishina, & Graham, 2006). There are two ways to conceptualize the\nethnic context: at the individual and at the school level. For the individual, having\nmore students of the same ethnicity may protect against victimization risk (Graham &\nJuvonen), but if victimized, may be an additional risk factor for maladjustment\n(Bellmore et al.). Ethnic context can also be explored at the classroom or school level,\nas the overall ethnic diversity can indicate something about the atmosphere of the\nschool (e.g., Juvonen et al., 2006). For example, are youth more likely to be victimized\nin schools where they were the minority, or the majority?\nPercent same ethnicity. Overall, research suggests that ethnic representation within\ncontext may be as or more important than ethnicity itself in predicting victimization\nrisk and its effects. For example, Hanish and Guerra (2000a) found that victimization\nrisk was related to ethnicity and school context, in that the diversity (measured as\npercent same-ethnicity at the individual-level) of the school had a differential influence\nby ethnicity. For African American, White, and Latino students, they calculated the\npercent of same ethnicity peers at each of 14 schools. School context moderated the\nvictimization rates for White and African American students, but did not affect the low\nvictimization rates of Latino students. For White children, attending ethnically\nintegrated schools increased their victimization rates, whereas for African American\nstudents it slightly lowered their victimization risk.\nClassroom or school ethnic context. Likewise, Graham and Juvonen (2002) argue that the\nethnic composition of a setting can signal an imbalance of power, and consequently\nlead to a context for harassment. They suggest that in a diverse school classroom, the\nstatistical minority might be more vulnerable to victimization, whereas the statistical\nmajority may be more likely to have reputations as perpetrators, rather than victims.\nThey had a sample of 418 students (Grades 6 and 7) representing the majority\nethnic groups of Latino and African American, and the minority ethnic groups of\nWhite, Persian or Middle Eastern, Asian or Pacific Islander, and Other (mainly\nbiracial students). They found that more students from the numerical minority ethnic\ngroups in the classrooms had reputations as victims, and the numerical majority ethnic\ngroups had more students with reputations as aggressors. Knowing that victimization\nrisk by ethnicity varied by how ethnically integrated the school context was\n862  Journal of Community Psychology, September 2011\nJournal of Community Psychology DOI: 10.1002/jcop\nunderscores the need for more research examining the nested nature of student\nvictimization data.\nIt remains to be seen if the overall ethnic diversity of a context creates an\natmosphere that discourages ethnic harassment. On one hand, Juvonen, Nishina, and\nGraham (2006) found that greater ethnic diversity in the classroom was associated with\nlower levels of perceived victimization, less loneliness, and greater perceptions of\nschool safety. However, in a study of peer racial discrimination in the Netherlands,\nVerkuyten and Thijs (2002) did not find that diversity of the classroom or the\npercentage of Dutch pupils compared with ethnic minority children influenced rates\nof racial discrimination.\nEthnic minority children were still more likely to report experiencing racist namecalling\nand social exclusion because of their ethnic background than Dutch children.\nIt was being in a classroom environment where teachers reacted to ethnic harassment\nthat reduced victimization. In our study, we explore variables that indicate peer\nvictimization in general (i.e., physical, verbal, and sexual harassment) as well as include a\nvariable representing possible ethnic discrimination (harassed or bullied because of race/\nethnicity). This allows us to ascertain how each may be influenced by ethnic context.\nCurrent Study\nPrior research demonstrates that the relation between ethnicity, ethnic context, and\nvictimization is complex and that more research with larger sample sizes and a greater\nnumber of schools is needed to help elucidate trends. Whereas prior studies used\nmiddle or elementary school samples, our study extends the inquiry to students in\nhigh school. This study also uses self-report instead of peer nomination methods of\nassessing victimization, has a larger sample of schools, has a more detailed measure of\npeer victimization than some prior research (e.g., Hanish & Guerra, 2000a), and can\ninclude under-represented ethnic groups, such as Native American and Asian\nAmerican students. We used hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) to address the\nindividual (gender, ethnicity, percent same ethnicity at the school) and school level\n(diversity, mean perception of school safety, and mean perception that victimization is\nbecause of race or ethnicity) factors that affect victimization. Perception of school safety\nis included because it is a correlate of peer victimization (Felix et al., 2009) and an\nindicator of the atmosphere of the school. We examine this for total victimization as\nwell as the specific subtypes of physical, verbal, and sexual harassment victimization to\ndetermine if patterns are consistent across victimization subtypes. This will allow for\ngreater understanding of how school ethnic context influences risk for various forms\nof peer victimization.\nFirst, we explore general trends in peer victimization by student demographic\ncharacteristics to better understand our sample. Then, we hypothesize that having\nmore same ethnicity peers would reduce student victimization risk. This is based on\nsome support from prior research (e.g., Graham & Juvonen, 2002) and from the\ntheoretical argument that victimization is possibly greatest when children are in the\nethnic group with least representation at school, which has guided past studies (e.g.,\nGraham & Juvonen; Hanish & Guerra, 2000a). Second, we examine the school context\nfactors that influence victimization risk. We focus on the school characteristics that may\nbe responsible for variation in victimization among schools, such as the school\xe2\x80\x99s level of\ndiversity, overall perception of school safety, and mean of students\xe2\x80\x99 perception that\nthey are targeted for harassment or bullying because of their race/ethnicity. These\nVictimization and Ethnic Context  863\nJournal of Community Psychology DOI: 10.1002/jcop\nthree variables were chosen because they indicate something about the overall\natmosphere of a given school. We hypothesized that greater school level diversity and\nsafety would be related to lower levels of victimization across the different types\nassessed. For diversity, although the research base does not provide clear direction,\nthis is based on the ideas that greater diversity may represent a balance of power\nbetween ethnic groups. If an ethnic group is a very small percentage of the student\npopulation (i.e., less than 10%), they may be at greater risk of victimization because of\nlack of power and more limited opportunity for intergroup contact that leads to crossethnic\nfriendship (at least for the majority group). We also expected that less school\nlevel harassment or bullying based on race or ethnicity (a possible indicator of ethnic\ndiscrimination) would be related to less victimization.\nMETHOD\nParticipants\nWe used the 2004\xe2\x80\x932005 academic year CHKS data sample. The original 2004\xe2\x80\x932005\nCHKS dataset represents approximately 94% of California\xe2\x80\x99s schools with enrollment\nfor Grades 7, 9, and 11, including students at nontraditional, alternative, and\ncontinuation schools. To be included in the survey, schools had to obtain consent from\nat least 65% of their students; districts varied on the use of active or passive consent\nprocedures. Only students who passed validity criteria (99%) were retained. Students\nwere excluded for inconsistent patterns of responding, implausible reports of drug\nuse, the endorsement of a fictitious drug, or failure to assent to having answered\nsurvey questions honestly. We selected the Grade 9 and Grade 11 students to examine\nhigh school students\xe2\x80\x99 victimization. We focus on high school students only, because this\nage group has not been addressed in prior research. This CHKS sample is different\nfrom our prior research with the CHKS (e.g., Felix et al., 2009), in that it uses data\ncollected in a different year and uses only high school students. We also explore the\nrole of ethnicity in greater detail than in our prior work.\nSample\nThe sample included 161,838 eligible Grade 9 and Grade 11 students attending\n528 schools. There were slightly more females (52.6%) than males (47.4%). The ethnic\ngroups represented include Native American (1.2%), Asian/Pacific Islander (7.5%),\nAfrican American (4.5%), Hispanic (38.1%), White (30.5%), and Other (18.2%).\nMeasures\nThe CHKS is a set of modules developed by WestEd\xe2\x80\x99s Human Development Program\nin collaboration with Duerr Evaluation Resources for the California Department of\nEducation California. The CHKS collects ongoing youth health and risk behavior data\nas part of the No Child Left Behind Act. Items for the measures were taken from the\nYouth Risk Behavior Survey (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and the\nCalifornia Student Survey (WestEd). In California, the CHKS is mandated statewide\nand is administered biannually at each school that receives public funding. The CHKS\nwas carefully developed having undergone more than 10 years of rigorous\ndevelopment and review by a standing panel of independent experts.\n864  Journal of Community Psychology, September 2011\nJournal of Community Psychology DOI: 10.1002/jcop\nStudent-Level Variables\nDemographics.

It\nranges from 0 to 1.00, with values closer to 1.00 indicating greater diversity.\nAnalysis\nWe developed two-level HLMs to test our hypotheses concerning both individual-level\nand school-level predictors. HLM allows for modeling the hierarchical relationships\n(i.e., the nesting of students within schools). This analysis strategy helps us avoid\nproblems including underestimating standard errors that are smaller than they should\nbe. First, we tested the null model, which contained only the outcome variable of\nvictimization without any individual-level or school-level explanatory variables. The\nnull model is useful to examine the proportion of variance in the outcome variables\narising from different levels (i.e., student level and school level) by partitioning the\noutcome variance among the nested units. To explain the variation at the student level,\nwe considered various individual characteristics such as ethnicity, gender, and percent\nsame ethnicity within the school. Next, we developed the level two (school level)\nmodel. We expanded on the second step by adding school level factors (diversity, mean\nperception of school safety, and mean perception that victimization is because of race\nor ethnicity) to the level two model to explain the variance associated with school\ncontext. Finally, significant coefficients associated with student\xe2\x80\x99s ethnicity were\nmodeled by percent same ethnicity at the school level.\nRESULTS\nDemographic Trends in Victimization\nPreliminary analysis of demographic trends was conducted to provide context for\nsubsequent analysis and interpretation of results. Descriptive statistics are provided in\nTable 1. For this table only, we dichotomized the various victimization experiences (no\nvictimization versus any victimization) to represent ever having been victimized in that\nway during the past 12 months and ran frequencies across grade, sex, and ethnicity.\nGiven the large sample size, there is the problem of all measures of association being\nstatistically significant, therefore, as with our prior research (e.g., Felix et al., 2009), we\ninterpret only differences that were also at least five percentage points. In our high\nschool sample, physical victimization decreased with grade, however other forms of\nvictimization remained similar. Native Americans had higher rates of physical\nvictimization than all other ethnicities. They also had higher rates of property being\nstolen and having been threatened or injured with a weapon than most other ethnic\ngroups, except African American students, who had the second highest ranking on\nthese variables. Asian/ Pacific Islander students had the lower rates of sexual\nharassment than all other ethnicities. Hispanic students were lower on sexual\nharassment victimization than White or African American students.\nMeans, standard deviations, and ranges for all variables used in this study are\npresented in Table 2. The means for each type of victimization are on the low end,\nindicating there are many students who reported no or infrequent victimization, which\nis consistent with much of peer victimization research and our past research using the\nCHKS. Differences in means were examined by ethnicity, with only po.01 considered\nsignificant because of the large sample size (see Table 2). Demographic trends were\nVictimization and Ethnic Context  867\nJournal of Community Psychology DOI: 10.1002/jcop\ngenerally consistent with the results from Table 1. The means for school level diversity\nwere consistent with prior research (Bellmore et al., 2004; Juvonen et al., 2006).\nThe means for percent same ethnicity were a little different than those found by\nHanish and Guerra (2000a), but it is understandable given that our sample is from a\ndifferent region in the United States. The distribution of scores on percent same\nethnicity ranged from 0 to 100, such that any particular ethnic group comprised\nbetween 0% and 100% of the school populations. Ranges by ethnicity were 0% for\nNative Americans, 0%\xe2\x80\x9383% (mean [M] 5 24.96%, standard deviation [SD] 5 21.60%)\nfor Asian Americans, 0%\xe2\x80\x9387% (M 5 11.25%, SD 5 9.65%) for African Americans,\n0%\xe2\x80\x9395% (M 5 52.54%, SD 5 20.89%) for Whites, and 2%\xe2\x80\x93100% (M 5 63.37%,\nSD 5 24.22%) for Hispanics.\nWe conducted HLM to assess individual and school predictors of victimization\nexperience by ethnicity and ethnic context of the school. First, a null model was applied\nto the data. This null model allowed us to partition the total variance in overall\nvictimization into within-school and between-school variances. Most of the variability lay\nwithin school among students (97%). Yet the chi-square test statistic of between-school\nvariability revealed that statistically significant variability existed between schools in\nstudents\xe2\x80\x99 average victimization scores. Therefore, even though the intra-class correlation\n(3%) was not high, we proceeded with the HLM at both student and school levels to\nadequately account for aspects of school context.

According to Cohen\xe2\x80\x99s (1988) guidelines,\neffect sizes of 0.1 and 0.2, between 0.2 and 0.5, and 0.5 or more are defined as small,\nmedium, and large, respectively.\nGender and ethnicity factors showed relatively small to large effects on the\nstudents\xe2\x80\x99 victimization experiences. Boys reported lower rates of total, verbal, and\nsexual harassment victimization than did girls, but had higher rates of physical\nvictimization. Asian Pacific Islanders were less victimized compared with their White\npeers across victimization types, but especially for sexual harassment. Hispanic\nstudents were also lower, with the exception of physical victimization, where there was\nno difference. The effect size was medium for sexual harassment for Hispanic\nstudents, which was the largest for them across victimization types. Native American\nstudents experienced more physical victimization compared with their White peers,\nbut had lower rates of verbal and sexual harassment victimization.\nPercent Same Ethnicity and Victimization Risk\nAs seen in Table 3, effect sizes (ranged from \x04.12 to \x04.21) indicated that there were\nsignificant, but relatively small effects of percent same ethnicity in the school on\nadolescents\xe2\x80\x99 peer victimization experience.

We subsequently explored different ethnic groups\xe2\x80\x99\nperceptions of being harassed or bullied because of race or ethnicity. A one-way\nbetween groups analysis of variance was conducted to explore the impact of ethnicity\non perceived victimization because of race/ethnicity. There was a statistically significant\ndifference at the po.05 level, F(4,128,902) 5 382.37, in perceived victimization\nbecause of race/ethnicity for the five ethnic groups. Asian Pacific Islanders\n(M 5 1.49, SD 5 .93) had highest scores among five ethnic groups, followed by African\nAmerican students (M 5 1.44, SD 5 .91). Native American, Hispanic, and White\nstudents reported significantly less victimization because of race/ethnicity than Asian\nPacific Islanders and African American students.\nInterestingly, for sexual harassment victimization, neither the level of diversity at\nthe school nor the perceptions of school safety affected risk for being sexually\nharassed. School diversity decreased risk of victimization for total, physical, and verbal\nvictimization (ES 5 \x04.17 to \x04.45, practically small to medium effects). There was not a\nrelation between school diversity and sexual harassment. Mean perception of school\nsafety negatively affected the risk of physical victimization.\nDISCUSSION\nWithin the school context, youth learn from their peers, teachers, and other adults\nabout acceptable behavior, how to handle conflict, ways to assert, manage, or limit\npower and control within relationships, and appropriate social behavior. At times, this\nbehavior can be influenced by an \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98in-group bias\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 (Brewer, 1979), where preference is\nfor peers similar to oneself. As peer victimization is a problem within every school, it is\nsomething that students and the adults in their lives learn to avoid, resolve, or endure.\nSometimes, peer victimization, such as teasing, is used as social control to shape a\nperson\xe2\x80\x99s behavior into what is considered the social norm, such as the sexual\nharassment of boys not perceived as masculine enough by their male peers (McMaster,\nConnolly, Pepler, & Craig, 2002). However, peer victimization can also target individual\ncharacteristics that are unchangeable, such as race/ethnicity, and can reflect negative\nsocietal attitudes about a particular group, which can also be a result of in-group bias\n(Brewer). Victimization targeting unchangeable personal characteristics arguably can\nincrease risk of feeling helpless or hopeless, or lower self-esteem (Verkuyten & Thijs,\n2006), perhaps because of self-blaming attributions (Bellmore et al., 2004).\nThis study focused on risk of peer victimization by ethnicity within the ethnic\ncontext of the school. We used hierarchical linear modeling to address the student\n(gender, ethnicity, percent same ethnicity at the school) and school level (diversity,\nmean perception of school safety, and mean perception that victimization is because of\nrace or ethnicity) factors that affect victimization. We examined this for total\nvictimization as well as the specific subtypes of physical, verbal, and sexual harassment\nvictimization to determine if patterns are consistent across victimization subtypes. Our\nstudy yielded results that further illuminate how ethnicity and school context influence\nvictimization risk.\nDemographic Trends in Victimization\nVictimization rates were examined by grade, gender, and ethnicity in Table 1. In our\nhigh school sample, physical victimization tended to decrease with age, which is\nconsistent with school bullying research (Olweus, 1994). As expected based on prior\n870  Journal of Community Psychology, September 2011\nJournal of Community Psychology DOI: 10.1002/jcop\nresearch (American Association of University Women [AAUW], 2001), sexual\nharassment victimization was the most common form of victimization in this older\nsample of youth. Our other gender-related findings also support extant research (e.g.,\nOlweus; AAUW, 2001), including that female students reported higher rates of verbal\nand sexual harassment victimization and males had higher physical victimization.\nIn terms of ethnicity, when examining simple frequencies, we found that Native\nAmerican students had higher rates of physical victimization than all other ethnicities.\nThey also were more likely to have property stolen or been threatened or injured with\na weapon than all other groups, except African Americans, who were second highest.\nOne possible explanation is that Native Americans are often a numerical minority at\nschools, which may increase victimization risk. Likewise, outside of the major urban\ncenters of California, African American students are also often a minority in schools.\nAlso, in the United States, African American and Native Americans have historically\nexperienced more systematic, widespread societal oppression and racism than other\nethnic groups (not to say that other ethnic groups have not also experienced\nprejudice). This may still be manifested in terms of more frequent prejudice and\nstereotyping that can increase risk of victimization.\nWhen rates of victimization by ethnicity were explored collectively using HLM,\nsmall to large effects were found. With Whites as the comparison group, Asian/Pacific\nIslander students reported significant lower rates of victimization than White students\nacross the total and different subtypes of victimization assessed, especially for sexual\nharassment. Hispanic students also showed significantly lower rates than White students,\nwith the exception of physical victimization, in which there was no difference. Among\nelementary school students, Hanish and Guerra (2000a) also found that Hispanic\nstudents reported significantly less victimization than White students. In the Hanish and\nGuerra (2000a) study, as with much of prior research, Asian/Pacific Islander students\nwere not studied separately because of small sample size, thus our findings on their low\nvictimization rates fill a gap in the research. In our study, Asian/Pacific Islander and\nAfrican American students were significantly more likely than the other ethnicities to\nreport that they perceived they were harassed or bullied because of their race/ethnicity.\nAnother understudied group of youth were those who identify as Native\nAmerican. With Whites as the comparison group, Native American students show\nsignificantly higher physical victimization risk, which was consistent with prior\nresearch (Stevens et al., 2005). However, they had lower verbal and sexual harassment\nvictimization. As research on peer victimization among Native Americans is scant,\nthere is not empirical guidance as to why their victimization was higher for physical,\nbut not verbal subtypes. This is an area for future research.\nPercent Same Ethnicity and Victimization Risk\nGiven disproportionately high rates of victimization for some groups of students, it was\nimportant to understand what contextual factors reduce risk. Having a greater\nnumber of students of the same ethnicity reduced victimization, across all types\nassessed. Graham and Juvonen (2002) point out that this increases the ethnic group\xe2\x80\x99s\npower (in the numerical sense) at the school, which can reduce victimization.\nVerkuyten and Thijs (2002) argue that measuring ethnic composition of a classroom or\nschool matters because the percent of same ethnicity peers may determine experience\nand attitudes. Specifically, they suggested that the greater the proportion of same\nethnicity peers, the more the child was protected from prejudice and discrimination;\nVictimization and Ethnic Context  871\nJournal of Community Psychology DOI: 10.1002/jcop\nwhereas when it was lower, discrimination may increase and there may be less social\nsupport to help a student cope.\nSchool Context and Victimization Risk\nPrior research has shown that ethnic representation within the school context matters\nwhen examining victimization risk and the mental health consequences of victimization\n(Graham & Juvonen, 2002). Our model of the school context included mean\nschool safety, diversity, and perceiving that you were targeted because of your race/\nethnicity. Our study explored factors related to victimization risk at the individual and\nschool level. Consistent with prior research on a younger sample (Hanish & Guerra,\n2000a), we found that among high school students victimization risk was related to\nethnicity and school context. Most variation was found at the student, not school, level.\nThis finding is consistent with prior work that found that most of the variability lay\nbetween individuals when it comes to students\xe2\x80\x99 nonacademic behavioral experiences\n(Ma, 2003; You, 2005). This supports the use of interventions targeted at students,\nsuch as much of the content of current violence prevention, conflict resolution, or\nother social-emotional prevention curriculum.\nDiversity. We found that greater diversity decreased victimization risk overall and across\nmost subtypes. The exception was sexual harassment. Diversity may decrease peer\nvictimization through its ability to reduce in-group bias and prejudice, which may be\none cause of some forms of peer victimization. Intergroup contact theory (Allport,\n1954; Pettigrew, 1998) has been used to explain how contact between different racial\nor ethnic groups can reduce prejudice. Allport described four conditions for the\nintergroup contact to be beneficial in reducing prejudice: equal group status within the\nsituation, common goals, intergroup cooperation, and authority support. Friendship\nbetween members of different ethnic groups can lead to all four conditions being met.\nAt schools with greater diversity, there is increased probability of intergroup contact\n(Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006), which increases the chance of cross-ethnic friendships. This\nmay lead to changes in stereotypes and behaviors (Pettigrew), which can reduce crossethnic\npeer victimization or ethnic discrimination.\nVictimization because of race/ethnicity. Prior research suggested that when students\nperceived they were being victimized by peers because of their race/ethnicity, they tended\nto interpret this as discrimination (Verkuyten, Kinket & Van der Wielen, 1997). Among\nthe school level variables included in this study, we found that mean perception of being\ntargeted for bullying because of race or ethnicity was the strongest predictor of student\ntotal victimization risk, and each subtype of victimization. It had large effect sizes for verbal\n(ES 5 .82) and sexual harassment (ES 5 .70) victimization, and medium for physical\nvictimization (ES 5 .37). It is likely that it is more apparent that an action is because of the\nrace/ethnicity of the recipient for verbal types of aggression. Verkuyten and Thijs (2002)\ncontend that children are more likely to say they have seen their same-ethnicity peers\ntargeted for racist name-calling and social exclusion than to have experienced it\nthemselves. Thus, it may affect school climate. It is important to note that they also found\nthat in classrooms where children saw teachers discipline ethnic harassment there was less\nharassment or bullying because of race.\nPerception of school safety. The overall perception of school safety at different school sites\nmay be another contextual factor associated with victimization risk. Our results indicated\n872  Journal of Community Psychology, September 2011\nJournal of Community Psychology DOI: 10.1002/jcop\nthat overall school safety affected risk of physical victimization. However, verbal\nvictimization was unrelated to overall school safety. It could be because of the questions\nasked, \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98had rumors or lies spread about you\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98been made fun of because of the way\nyou look or talk,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 which can often occur between friends. Students may greatly dislike\nexperiencing these behaviors, and may avoid school or people because of embarrassment,\nbut they may not necessarily experience fear. Verbal victimization affects the\nquality of the school environment, but by itself may not lead to feeling unsafe.\nStrengths and Limitations\nPrior research has examined victimization risk within the ethnic context of the school,\nbut a strength of this study was extending the inquiry to high school youth. This study\nalso benefited from a large group of students and schools to help with generalizability of\nour findings. Because of the large sample size, this study was able to fill in gaps in\npeer victimization research on Native American and Asian/Pacific Islander students.\nWe used HLM, which accounted for variance at the student and school level, and this\nstrengthened our findings. Finally, this study assessed the model across different types\nof victimization, whereas previous research tended to look at overall victimization.\nOne limitation was that this study was solely self-report, and students can vary in\ntheir propensity to believe they were victimized because of their race/ethnicity or\nwhether behaviors were unwanted and hurtful. In addition, although intergroup\ncontact theory may explain why school diversity can reduce victimization risk, the\nCHKS survey does not directly assess the components of the theory, such as equal\nstatus within groups and cross-ethnic contact and friendships. Finally, this study was\ncross-sectional, so direction of causality cannot be determined.\nConclusion\nOverall, we found support that the ethnic context matters when looking at\nvictimization risk. Most of the variation in victimization risk can be explained at the\nstudent level. At the student level, having more same ethnicity peers reduced\nvictimization risk. At the school level, diversity and mean perception of being targeted\nfor bullying because of race or ethnicity were related to most victimization types.\nHowever, like at the student level, diversity was a factor in reducing risk for many\nforms of victimization at the school level. School diversity can increase probability of\ncross-ethnic friendships that can reduce prejudice and stereotyping (Pettigrew &\nTropp, 2006). Regardless of the balance of power between ethnic groups within a\ngiven school, students benefit from an environment where teachers and staff actively\naddress peer victimization and harassment in all its forms (Olweus, 1994; Verkuyten &\nThijs, 2002). This will lead to safer schools for all students.\nREFERENCES\nAboud, F.E. (2003). The formation of in-group favoritism and out-group prejudice in young\nchildren: Are they distinct attitudes?

aS"A latent class analysis of school climate among middle and high school\nstudents in California public schools\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nResearch has shown that a positive school climate plays a protective role in the social, emotional, and academic\ndevelopment of adolescent youth. Researchers have utilized variable centered measures to assess school climate,\nwhich is limited in capturing heterogeneous patterns of school climate. In addition, few studies have systematically\nexplored the role of race and gender in perceived school climate. This study utilizes a latent class approach to\nassess whether there are discrete classes of school climate in a diverse statewide sample of middle and high\nschool youth. Drawing from the 2009\xe2\x80\x932011 California Healthy Kids Survey, this study identified four latent classes\nof school climate: Some caring, connectedness, and safe; negative climate; high caring, participation, and safe;\nand positive climate. The findings indicated that race and grade level significantly predicted school climate class\nmembership. Black students were three times more likely to be members of the negative school climate class,\nwhen compared to White students. Gender did not significantly predict school climate class membership. The results\nof this study provide school climate researchers and educators with a nuanced picture of school climate patterns\namong middle and high school students.\n\xc2\xa9 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction\nResearchers and educators for several decades have acknowledged\nthat a positive school climate plays a contributing role in a wide range\nof adolescent outcomes, including academic achievement, mental\nhealth, substance abuse, and school violence (Thapa, Cohen, Guffey, &\nHiggins-D'Alessandro, 2013). School climate organizations such as the\nNational School Climate Center, Center for Academic, Social and Emotional\nLearning (CASEL) have recently developed state standards and\nschool-based programs, interventions, curriculum, and resources for\nimproving school climate. In addition, in the past two decades, public\nschools throughout the United States have incorporated school climate\ninterventions into educational reform initiatives. Efforts to improve\nschool climate such as bullying prevention, threat assessment, and\nschool safety programs have been implemented by K-12 schools in\nthe United States and in international contexts to foster caring relationships,\nsafety, and connectedness among youth (Benbenishty & Astor,\n2005; Thapa et al., 2013).\nDefining and measuring school climate has been a challenge. Researchers\nhave noted the discrepancies in the literature, regarding\nschool climate domains and measures (Cohen, McCabe, Michelli, &\nPickeral, 2009; Zullig, Koopman, Patton, & Ubbes, 2010). Scholars have\nrecently defined school climate as the collective beliefs, values, and attitudes\nthat prevail at school and have measured the multiple dimensions\nof school climate, including caring relationships with adults, safety,\nschool connectedness, and meaningful participation (Cohen et al.,\n2009; Koth, Bradshaw, & Leaf, 2008; Modin & \xc3\x96stberg, 2009; Thapa\net al., 2013; Zullig et al., 2010). However, most research has assessed\nschool climate using individual scales of school climate in isolation.\nFew studies have attempted to uncover the heterogenous patterns of\nschool climate, as experienced by students (Konold & Cornell, 2015).\nIn addition, while educational researchers have documented differential\nacademic achievement and outcomes by race and gender, researchers\nhave not systematically explored how different groups of students (i.e.\nrace and gender) experience multiple dimensions of school climate\n(Gage, Prykanowski, & Larson, 2014; Thapa et al., 2013). Given this\ngap in school climate research, this study utilizes a latent class approach\nto explore heterogenous patterns of school climate in a large statewide\nsample of middle and high school students. This study also examines\nhow different groups of students (i.e. race and gender) experience multiple\ndimensions of school climate.\n1.1. Defining school climate\nRecently, a series of school climate studies and literature reviews has\ndefined school climate as comprised of multiple dimensions (Cohen\net al., 2009; De Pedro, Astor, Gilreath, Benbenishty, & Esqueda, 2014;\nChildren and Youth Services Review 63 (2016) 10\xe2\x80\x9315\n\xe2\x81\x8e Corresponding author.\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2016.01.023\n0190-7409/\xc2\xa9 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\nContents lists available at ScienceDirect\nChildren and Youth Services Review\njournal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/childyouth\nThapa et al., 2013). These dimensions include caring relationships with\nadults, safety, school connectedness, and meaningful participation\n(Benbenishty & Astor, 2005; De Pedro et al., 2014). Caring relationships\nis defined as a student's perception of the extent of social and emotional\nsupport they receive from teachers and other school adults. Safety is de-\nfined as a student's sense of physical and social\xe2\x80\x93emotional security.\nSchool connectedness is defined as the degree to which students feel\nthey belong to a school community and have a positive connection\nwith peers and adults in a school community. Meaningful participation\nis the involvement of students in relevant, engaging and interesting opportunities\nthat develop a sense of responsibility in the school community\n(Benbenishty & Astor, 2005; De Pedro et al., 2014). Recent studies\nhave utilized these domains to assess school climate in different school\ncontexts (De Pedro, Astor, Gilreath, Benbenishty, & Berkowitz, 2015; De\nPedro, Astor, Gilreath, Benbenishty, & Berkowitz, in press; De Pedro\net al., 2014).\nA positive and caring social and emotional school climate has been\nfound to influence a wide array of adolescent outcomes (Cohen et al.,\n2009; Thapa et al., 2013). This includes schooling, such as attendance,\nmotivation, cooperative learning, and test scores; risky behaviors, such\nas bullying and victimization, aggression, risky sexual behavior, alcohol,\nand drug use; and psychological outcomes, including psychiatric disorders,\ndepression, anxiety, and well-being. Studies have demonstrated\nthe protective effect of school climate on youth development in various\ngeographic locales (Astor, Benbenishty, & Estrada, 2010; Thapa et al.,\n2013). For instance, scholars have found that school climate mitigates\nthe effect of poverty, war and trauma, community violence, and family\nstress on schooling, mental health, and social development (Astor\net al., 2010; Benbenishty & Astor, 2005; Marachi, Astor, & Benbenishty,\n2006; Thapa et al., 2013).\nSchool climate researchers primarily have utilized a variable centered\napproach. This approach aims to examine how different school climate\nconstructs influence outcomes. The variable centered approach is\nlimited in capturing heterogenous patterns of school climate, specifically\nhow different components of school climate coalesce among students\n(Gage et al., 2014; Konold & Cornell, 2015). Latent class analysis (LCA) is\nan exploratory person centered approach that assumes a categorical latent\nfactor. The goal of LCA is to group individuals into categories, each\none of which contains individuals who are similar to each other and different\nfrom individuals in other categories (Muth\xc3\xa9n & Muth\xc3\xa9n, 2000).\nLCA is well suited for one critical aim of this study, which is to uncover\ndiscrete classes of school climate in a large sample of middle and high\nschool students.\n1.2. Race, gender, and school climate\nResearch exploring the role of race as a factor that influences school\nclimate perceptions is a growing area of research (Koth et al., 2008;\nThapa et al., 2013). Among elementary students, perceived caring relationships\nvary by race. Schneider and Duran (2010) found that Latino\nthird grade students viewed personal relationships with teachers\nmore important than adults modeling positive behaviors; this view\nwas different from White and Asian students. Furthermore, in a study\nof 1000 African-American students and 260 Latino third graders in the\nChicago Comer School Development Program, African-American children\nperceived teacher-child relations as the most important dimension\nof school climate, while Latino students prioritized teacher fairness, caring,\npraise of effort, and the importance of moral order above other aspects\nof school climate (Slaughter-Defoe & Carlson, 1996).\nOnly a few studies have examined the role of race in explaining variation\nin school climate among middle and high school youth. These\nstudies have focused on students' perception of racial climate.\nSchneider and Duran (2010) found that African-American middle and\nhigh school youth perceive racial climate more negatively than White\npeers. Furthermore, a negative racial climate was significantly related\nto higher rates of discipline and lower grade among racial minority\nstudents, which in turn, adversely impacted college preparation\n(Schneider & Duran, 2010; Thapa et al., 2013). More studies are needed\nto explore how different racial groups experience multiple components\nof school climate. Given this gap in school climate research, the current\nstudy explores associations between school climate class membership\nand race.\nSchool climate studies have not yet examined differences in how\nboys and girls experience multiple components of school climate. However,\nschool violence researchers have identified differences in the frequency\nand type of violence experienced by boys and girls at school,\nwhich is known to impact perceptions of safety, a dimension of school\nclimate (Benbenishty & Astor, 2005). Some research found that boys\nare more likely to report frequent victimization than girls while other\nresearch indicated no significant differences between boys and girls\nin victimization prevalence (Berkowitz, De Pedro, & Gilreath, 2015).\nDisparities in the frequency of male and female students' victimization\nmay be explained by the type of violence experienced by both genders.\nStudies have shown that female students are more likely to experience\nrelational and indirect victimization while male students are more likely\nto experience direct forms of physical victimization (Batsche & Knoff,\n1994; Casey-Cannon, Pasch, Tschann, & Flores, 2006; Finkelhor,\nOrmrod, & Turner, 2007; Hartung, Little, Allen, & Page, 2011;\nMurray-Close, Ostrov, & Crick, 2007; Peskin, Tortolero, & Markham,\n2006). In addition, girls experience sexual harassment more frequently\nthan boys, and boys perpetrate sexual harassment more frequently\nthan girls (Gruber & Fineran, 2007; McMaster, Connolly, Pepler, &\nCraig, 2002; Pepler et al., 2006). These disparities in the experience of\nviolence and victimization by boys and girls, have led us to hypothesize\nthat boys and girls may also experience climate differently. Hence, this\nstudy explores gender as a factor influencing school climate class\nmembership.\n1.3. Study objectives\nThe current study contributes to the emerging need among educational\nresearchers and school professionals for a deeper understanding\nof the complex patterns of school climate among middle and high\nschool students. Hence, this study utilizes latent class analysis to identify\nand classify school climate perceptions in a statewide sample of secondary\npublic school students in California. This study also assesses how\ndemographic variables such as race and gender are associated with\nschool climate.\nLatent class analysis is utilized as an exploratory tool to examine a\nmulti-dimensional construct, school climate, in a novel way. Notwithstanding,\nwe anticipated that there would be at least three classes of\nstudents based upon the literature\xe2\x80\x94those that did not perceive positive\nschool climate, those who were mixed in their perceptions, and those\nwho perceived positive school climate. Based on previous research on\nrace and school climate, we expected low levels of school climate to\nbe associated with non-white students.\n2. Method\nThis study employed a cross-sectional design. The data used in this\nstudy are from the 2011\xe2\x80\x932013 administration of the California Healthy\nKids Survey (CHKS), conducted by the California Department of Education\nand WestEd, a nonprofit research, development, and service agency.\nThe CHKS is the largest statewide survey of elementary, middle, and\nhigh school students' perceptions of school climate, resiliency, and risk\nbehaviors in the United States (Austin, Bates, & Duerr, 2013). The\nCHKS is a biennial survey that is comprised of a required core module\nthat gathers demographic data (i.e. gender, grade, and race and ethnicity),\nschool climate perceptions, and health-related behaviors (i.e. alcohol\nuse, drug use, violence and victimization).\nK.T. De Pedro et al. / Children and Youth Services Review 63 (2016) 10\xe2\x80\x9315 11\n2.1. Participants and consent procedures\nAs required by the California Department of Education (CDE),\nschools must survey a representative districtwide grade-level sample\nof students in the 5th, 7th, 9th, and 11th grades. The sampling procedure\nrequires that (a) 100% of all district schools participated or 100%\nof all selected schools from an approved sampling plan participated;\n(b) an appropriate class subject or class period was identified and\nused; (c) 100% of selected classrooms participated; (d) the number of\ncompleted, usable answer forms obtained per grade was 60% or more\nof the selected sample; or (d) if active parental consent was used, 70%\nor more parents within each grade's selected sample returned signed\npermission forms, either consenting or not consenting to their child's\nparticipation.\nParental consent was obtained for each participant by each school\ndistrict before survey administration through the CDE and WestEd.\nThe core survey module was administered by school staff members familiar\nwith survey administration or by West Ed proctors if a school\nsite chose to hire professionally trained survey administrators.\nProctoring instructions were provided for all survey administrators. All\nproctors read an introductory script to all student participants. Proctors\nencouraged participants to respond to questions honestly and assured\nthat their responses would be anonymous. Participants were permitted\nto withdraw from the survey at any time. The survey took approximately\n50 min to complete.\nCHKS data was collected for the 2011\xe2\x80\x932013 academic school years\nfrom students (n = 577,026). A weighting procedure was used to adjust\nthe total of grade level respondents to represent the total district enrollment\nfor the particular grade levels of interest and district level clustering\nwas also accounted for. District-level consent procedures were\nfollowed, and the present study has appropriate university IRB\napproval.\n2.2. Measures\nThis study included demographic variables such as student selfreported\ndemographic variables (grade level, race and ethnicity, and\ngender). Grade level was represented by seventh grade as the reference\ncategory and two dummy variables\xe2\x80\x94ninth grade and 11th grade. Race\nand ethnicity was represented by White as the reference category, and\nthe dummy variables were Black, Asian/NH/PI, Hispanic/Latino ethnicity,\nand multiple races.\n2.2.1. School climate measures\nAs seen in Table 1, multiple school climate variables from the CHKS\nwere included in this study. The following domains and items of school\nclimate were utilized in recent studies to assess school climate: safety,\ncaring relationships, school connectedness, and meaningful participation.\nPast research utilizing these items have shown these scales to\nhave high reliability and construct validity (De Pedro et al., 2015, in\npress).\n2.2.1.1. Safety. One item asked respondents about their perceptions of\nsafety in their schools. The item is \xe2\x80\x9cHow safe do you feel when you are\nat school?\xe2\x80\x9d The responses to this item were 1 = very safe, 2 = safe,\n3 = neither safe nor unsafe, 4 = unsafe, and 5 = very unsafe.\n2.2.1.2. Caring relationships. The caring relationships scale was comprised\nof six items: At my school, there is a teacher or some other\nadult who tells me I do a good job; who tells me when I do good; who\nnotices when I'm not there; who always wants me to do my best;\nwho listens to me when I have something to say; who believes I will\nbe a success. The responses to these items were on a four-point Likert\nscale and ranged from 1 = not at all true, 2 = a little true, 3 = pretty\nmuch true, and 4 = very much true.\n2.2.1.3. School connectedness. The school connectedness scale was comprised\nof three items: Strongly agree or disagree with, I feel close to people\nat this school; I am happy to be at this school; I feel like I am part of\nthis school; The teachers at this school treat students fairly; I feel safe in\nmy school. The possible responses to these items were on a five-point\nLikert scale and ranged from 1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree,\n3 = neither disagree nor agree, 4 = agree, and 5 = strongly agree.\n2.2.1.4. Meaningful participation. The meaningful participation scale was\ncomprised of three items: I do interesting activities at school; At school, I\nhelp decide things like class activities; and, I do things that make a difference.\nThe possible responses to these items were on a four-point\nLikert scale and ranged 1 = not at all true, 2 = a little true, 3 = pretty\nmuch true, and 4 = very much true. The composite score of each participant\nwas derived by summing up the three items and dividing by 3.\nTable 1\nSchool climate variables from California Healthy Kids Survey:\nVariable Items\nSchool\nconnectedness\n\xe2\x80\x9cStrongly agree or disagree with\xe2\x80\xa6\n\xe2\x80\xa6I feel close to people at this school.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\xa6I am happy to be at this school.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\xa6I feel like I am part of this school.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\xa6I feel safe at this school.\n\xe2\x80\xa6Teachers at this school treat students fairly.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe possible responses to these items were 1) strongly\ndisagree; 2) disagree; 3) neither disagree nor agree; 4) agree;\nand 5) strongly agree.\nCaring\nrelationships\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt my school there is a teacher or some other adult who\xe2\x80\xa6\n\xe2\x80\xa6really cares about me.\n\xe2\x80\xa6tells me when I do a good job.\n\xe2\x80\xa6notices when I'm not there.\n\xe2\x80\xa6wants me to do my best.\n\xe2\x80\xa6listens to me when I have something to say.\n\xe2\x80\xa6believes I will be a success.\nThe possible responses to these items were 1) not at all true;\n2) a little true; 3) pretty much true; and 4) very much true.\nSafety \xe2\x80\x9cHow safe do you feel when you are at school?\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe possible responses to this item were A) very safe; B) safe;\nC) neither safe nor unsafe; D) unsafe; and E) very unsafe.\nMeaningful\nparticipation\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt school\xe2\x80\xa6\n\xe2\x80\xa6I do interesting things at school.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\xa6I help decide things like class activities or rules.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\xa6I do things that make a difference.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe possible responses to this item were A) not at all true;\nB) a little true; C) pretty much true; D) very much true; and\nE) don't know.\nTable 2\nSample characteristics (N = 577,026).\nWeighted % Unweighted n\nGender\nMale 49.0% 280,585\nFemale 51.0% 292,182\nGrade\n7th grade 34.3% 197,920\n9th grade 34.5% 199,402\n11th grade 31.2% 180,625\nRace/ethnicity\nMultiple 12.0% 69,358\nBlack 3.6% 20,643\nWhite 22.6% 130,318\nAsian 10.8% 62,609\nLatino 51.1% 295,019\n12 K.T. De Pedro et al. / Children and Youth Services Review 63 (2016) 10\xe2\x80\x9315\n2.3. Analytic approach\nLCA was conducted using Mplus 7.3 (Lubke & Muth\xc3\xa9n, 2007). LCA is\nused to identify homogeneous subgroups, which share a common pattern\nof responses within a heterogeneous population (Lanza, Collins,\nLemmon, & Schafer, 2007; Magidson & Vermunt, 2002). Multinomial logistic\nregression analyses were completed simultaneously with class estimation\nto account for measurement error related to class assignment.\nGender, race/ethnicity and grade level were included as demographic\ncovariates in that regression.\nA series of models was run to determine the appropriate number of\nclasses for school climate. We started with a 1-class model followed by\na series of models with specifying increased number of classes (e.g. 2-\nclass and 3-class), each representing different patterns of school climate.\nOptimal model selection was based upon recommended indices including\nlow Adjusted Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) relative to other\nmodels, significant Lo\xe2\x80\x93Mendell\xe2\x80\x93Rubin Likelihood Ratio Test (LMR LRT),\nand acceptable quality of classification (Nylund, Asparouhov, & Muth\xc3\xa9n,\n2007). Once the appropriate number of classes was identified, a final\nmodel including the demographic variables as predictors of class membership\nwas run.\n3. Results\n3.1. Sample characteristics\nThe sample was 49% male. 34.3% of the students were in 7th, 34.5%\nwere in 9th grade, and 31.2% were in the 11th grade (see Table 2). Latino\nstudents comprised 51.1% of the sample, followed by Whites (22.6%),\nAsians (10.8%), Multiracial (12.0%), and African American (3.6%).\n3.2. Description of the latent classes\nAs shown in Table 3, a four class model provided the best overall fit\nto the data for school climate. The four class solution was based on a significant\nLo\xe2\x80\x93Mendel\xe2\x80\x93Rubin Likelihood Ratio Test (LMR-LRT). The five\nclass solution was not significant indicating the four class solution fits\nthe data better. In addition, the BIC for the four class solution was\n5,256,005.504, and the BIC solution for the five class solution was\n6,039,094.710. The four class solution had the lowest absolute value, indicating\nthat this solution fit the data better. Finally, from a substantive\nstandpoint, the additional class obtained in the five class solution was\nnot practically different from the negative class in the four class\nsolution.\nThe four classes were termed: Some caring, connectedness, and safe;\nnegative climate; high caring, participation, and safe; and positive climate.\nThis is exemplified by the non-significant p-value for the five\nclass model which indicates that the (K-1)-class model should not be\nrejected in favor of a model with at least K-classes.\nConditional means and probabilities for school climate are summarized\nin Table 3. The results showed that 51.1% of all participants were\nin the first latent class. The members of this class reported average levels\nof caring representing \xe2\x80\x9cpretty much true.\xe2\x80\x9d This class had neutral (neither\nagree nor disagree) perceptions of connectedness and perceived\n\xe2\x80\x9ca little\xe2\x80\x9d meaningful participation. They had over a 50% chance of\nreporting that they felt safe or very safe at their school. Approximately\n11% of youth were in latent class two. This class on average \xe2\x80\x9cdisagreed\xe2\x80\x9d\nwith feeling connected to school and perceived \xe2\x80\x9ca little\xe2\x80\x9d caring relationships\nand participation. They had a 25% chance of feeling safe or very\nsafe in school. Latent class three was comprised of 2.4% of the sample.\nThe members of this class on average disagreed that they were connected\nto school. They perceived \xe2\x80\x9cpretty much true\xe2\x80\x9d that they had caring relationships\nand on average close to perceiving it was \xe2\x80\x9cpretty much true\xe2\x80\x9d\nthat meaningful participation existed. They had a 62% chance of\nreporting that they felt safe or very safe in school. Finally, 35.2% were\nin latent class four. On average youth agreed that they were connected\nat school and that it was \xe2\x80\x9cpretty much true\xe2\x80\x9d that they had caring relationships\nand meaningful participation in their school. The members\nof this class had an almost 90% chance of reporting that they felt safe\nor very safe in their school.\n3.3. Multinomial logistic regression analyses of race, gender, and school\nclimate\nMultinomial logistic regression analyses showed that race influenced\nschool climate class membership (see Table 4). Compared to\nWhites, African Americans were almost three times as likely to be members\nof the negative climate class (OR = 2.90, 95% CI 2.58\xe2\x80\x933.25) and\n1.65 times as likely to be in the some caring, connectedness, and safe\nclass (OR = 1.65, 95% CI 1.53\xe2\x80\x931.79). African-Americans were also\nmore than three times as likely to be members of the high caring, participation,\nand safe class, when compared to White students (OR = 3.38,\n95% CI 2.94\xe2\x80\x933.89). Compared to Whites, Latino students were twice as\nlikely to be in the high caring, participation, and safe climate class\n(OR = 2.42, 95% CI 2.25\xe2\x80\x932.61) and twice as likely to be in the some caring,\nconnectedness, participation, and safe class (OR = 2.00, 95% CI\n1.90\xe2\x80\x932.11). In addition, compared to White students, Asian students\nwere 1.47 times more likely to be members of the some caring, connectedness,\nand safe climate class. As seen in Table 4, multinomial logistic\nregression showed no significant associations between gender and\nschool climate class membership.\nBeing in a higher grade was associated with membership in negative\nschool climate, when compared to positive school climate. Ninth\ngraders were significantly more likely to be members of the low school\nclimate class (OR = 1.87, 95% CI 1.71\xe2\x80\x932.04) when compared to 7th\ngraders and more likely to report moderate climate (OR = 1.58, 95%\nCI 1.44\xe2\x80\x931.73). Eleventh graders were significantly more likely to be\nmembers of the negative school climate (OR = 1.73, 95% CI 1.59\xe2\x80\x93\n1.90) when compared to 7th graders and more likely to be classified\nin the high caring, participation, and safe school climate class (OR =\n2.05, 95% CI 1.89\xe2\x80\x932.22).\nTable 3\nConditional means and probabilities (N = 577,026).\nSchool climate variable Latent class 1\n51.1%\nSome caring, connectedness, and safe\nLatent class 2\n11.3%\nNegative climate\nLatent class 3\n2.4%\nHigh caring, participation, and safe\nLatent class 4\n35.2%\nPositive climate\nSchool connectedness 3.477 2.252 1.692 4.222\nCaring relationships 2.800 1.860 3.393 3.535\nMeaningful participation 1.954 1.527 2.749 2.899\nHow safe do you feel at school?\nVery safe 0.119 0.124 0.361 0.387\nSafe 0.448 0.125 0.260 0.503\nNeither safe nor unsafe 0.378 0.457 0.188 0.093\nUnsafe 0.040 0.143 0.089 0.010\nVery unsafe 0.015 0.152 0.102 0.007\nK.T.

Discussion and implications\nTo date, studies have utilized traditional variable centered approaches\nfor examining school climate. These studies have indicated\nthat caring relationships, school connectedness, meaningful participation,\nand sense of safety have a protective effect on youth development\nand outcomes. In addition, few studies have systematically examined\nthe role of race and gender in explaining school climate variation. Drawing\nfrom a diverse statewide sample of middle and high school students,\nthis study utilized latent class analysis to explore whether there were\ndiscrete groups of students who experience distinct patterns of perceived\nschool climate and the role of race and gender. Four classes of\nschool climate \xe2\x80\x94 some caring, connectedness, and safe; negative climate;\nhigh caring, participation, and safe; and positive climate \xe2\x80\x94 were\nuncovered. More than a third of students were in the positive climate\nclass\xe2\x80\x94high levels of perceived safety, caring relationships, school connectedness,\nand meaningful participation; about a tenth of the sample\nwere members of the negative climate class. More than half of the students\nwere in the some caring, connectedness, and safe climate class.\nThe study's findings indicated racial differences in school climate\nperceptions, adding to current research on race and school climate\n(Thapa et al., 2013). Non-white middle and high school students were\nsignificantly more likely than their White counterparts to be members\nof the negative climate class, which is defined by low levels of caring relationships,\nschool connectedness, safety, and meaningful participation.\nOne reason for racial differences in the latent classes of school climate\nmay be traced to the context of school communities serving racial minority\nstudents. A large body of educational policy research has found\nthat low SES Black and Latino students are often in public schools and\ndistricts with limited financial resources and personnel, impeding the\ndevelopment and implementation of school climate programs\n(Ladson-Billings, 2006; Loeb, Darling-Hammond, & Luczak, 2005). In\naddition, communities surrounding schools with predominantly low\nSES, black and Latino communities, often have high levels of poverty\nand violence, which adversely affect a school's social and emotional climate\n(Gregory, Skiba, & Noguera, 2010). Moreover, predominantly low\nSES, black and Latino school communities on average have significantly\nhigher rates of teacher and principal turnover, suspension and expulsion\nrates, truancy, and gang membership, which are factors known to\naffect a school's climate (Gregory et al., 2010; Skiba, Michael, Nardo, &\nPeterson, 2002).\nThis study found that higher grade is a significant factor in predicting\nmembership in the poor school climate class. This confirms findings\nfrom past studies, which have indicated that students in high school\nfeel more disengagement from school, report few caring adults, and\nfeel less connected to peers (Benbenishty & Astor, 2005; Pianta &\nAllen, 2008; Thapa et al., 2013). One potential reason for this finding\ncould be the structure of middle and high schools. As students move\nthrough middle and high school grades, they have multiple teachers according\nto subject, may be tracked according to their ability, and thus,\nhave less time to develop caring relationships with teachers and other\nschool adults (Pianta & Allen, 2008). Moreover, adolescents in large\nand comprehensive high school environments may feel isolated.\nMore research incorporating large samples of students in different\ngeographic locations are needed to investigate demographic differences\nin perceived school climate. Such knowledge would be useful for educational\npolicymakers and school leaders interested in gaining a more\ncomplete understanding of how students feel in schools, as well as differences\nin how social groups (e.g. race, gender, grade, and other social\ngroups) experience school climate. This enhanced understanding of climate\nwould help leaders become more proactive in improving school\nclimate programs and interventions and the academic, social, and emotional\noutcomes for all youth.\n4.1. Limitations and future directions\nThe present study provides detailed knowledge about school climate\nin California schools, however, there are limitations that must be noted.\nFirst, the data are cross-sectional, and thus causality cannot be explored.\nSecond, as with much research on school climate, this study assesses\nschool climate through self-reported survey items from the California\nHealthy Kids Survey (CHKS). Future school climate research should incorporate\nobservable measures of school climate, such as school suspension\nand expulsion rates, truancy, and teacher retention. This\nresearch could help validate school climate studies using self-reported\nsurvey data. Third, we recognize that socioeconomic status is a critical\ndemographic variable needed in future school climate research, however,\nthe 2011\xe2\x80\x932013 California Healthy Kids Survey (CHKS) does not have\nitems for SES. Research has found that socioeconomic context can adversely\nimpact student outcomes, including mental health and academic\nachievement. Astor et al. (2010) found that a school environment\nwhere adults demonstrate care for students, provide opportunities for\nmeaningful participation, and promote physical safety acts as a buffer\nagainst the stress of neighborhood poverty. Future latent class analyses\nof school climate could examine associations between socioeconomic\nstatus and discrete classes of school climate. Studies could also explore\nhow school climate mitigates the relationships between socioeconomic\nstatus and student outcomes. Fourth, this study did not explore associations\nbetween the latent classes of school climate and student outcomes.\nWe recommend that future studies incorporate LCA to explore\nrelationships between school climate and an array of student outcomes\nsuch as victimization, substance use, academic achievement, and mental\nhealth. Last, we recommend that future latent class analyses of\nschool climate explore within-school variation and school factors moderating\nassociations between latent classes of school climate, race, gender,\ngrade level, and other student demographic factors. Such research\nwould help deepen knowledge of patterns of school climate perceptions\namong secondary students.\n5. Conclusion\nFew studies to date have attempted to explore the heterogenous\npatterns of school climate and differences among students. Utilizing latent\nclass analysis (LCA), this study examined the mutually constitutive\ndimensions of perceived school climate. The findings of this study indicated\nfour distinguished classes of school climate. Race and grade level\nsignificantly predicted class membership, however, associations between\ngender and school climate class were not significant. This study\nfound that Black, Latino, and Asian students were more likely to be\nmembers of the negative school climate class, when compared to their\nWhite counterparts. Findings from this study provide policy makers\nand leaders with a more complete understanding of school climate in\nmiddle and high schools throughout California.\nTable 4\nMultinomial logistic regression results (N = 577,026).\nVariables LC1 vs LC4 LC2 vs LC4 LC3 vs LC4\nOR (95% CI) OR (95% CI) OR (95% CI)\nRace\nWhite (reference) 1.00 1.00 1.00\nAsian 1.47 (1.37\xe2\x80\x931.57) 1.16 (1.05\xe2\x80\x931.28) 1.26 (1.14\xe2\x80\x931.39)\nBlack 1.65 (1.53\xe2\x80\x931.79) 2.90 (2.58\xe2\x80\x933.25) 3.38 (2.94\xe2\x80\x933.89)\nMultiple 1.54 (1.48\xe2\x80\x931.60) 1.91 (1.80\xe2\x80\x932.04) 1.70 (1.54\xe2\x80\x931.86)\nLatino 2.00 (1.90\xe2\x80\x932.11) 2.42 (2.25\xe2\x80\x932.61) 1.70 (1.57\xe2\x80\x931.85)\nGrade\n7 (reference) 1.00 1.00 1.00\n9th 1.44 (1.36\xe2\x80\x931.53) 1.87 (1.71\xe2\x80\x932.04) 1.58 (1.44\xe2\x80\x931.73)\n11th 1.21 (1.14\xe2\x80\x931.29) 1.73 (1.59\xe2\x80\x931.90) 2.05 (1.89\xe2\x80\x932.22)\nGender\nMale (reference) 1.00 1.00 1.00\nFemale 1.01 (0.99\xe2\x80\x931.04) 0.91 (0.88\xe2\x80\x930.94) 0.81 (0.78\xe2\x80\x930.85)\nBold values indicate significance at regression results; p b 0.01.\n14 K.T.

aS'Factors Associated with Peer Sexual Harassment Victimization Among Taiwanese Adolescents\n\n\n\n\nAbstract \nThis study examined the individual and interpersonal\nfactors of peer sexual harassment victimization among\nTaiwanese adolescents. A random sample of 1,376 7th to 9th\ngrade middle school students in Taichung City, Taiwan,\ncompleted questionnaires about their demographics, delinquency,\npeer/teacher interaction, and experience of being\nsexually harassed by peers. Approximately 25.4% of the\nrespondents had suffered peer sexual harassment during the\nprevious semester. Boys reported more exposure to sexual\nharassment than did girls. Multivariate logistic regression\nanalyses were performed separately for boys and girls.\nSignificant risk factors of peer sexual harassment victimization\nfor both genders included being bullied by peers and\nteacher maltreatment. Boys\xe2\x80\x99 sexual harassment victimization\nwas also associated with their involvement in fights. Peer\nrelationship problems contributed to girls\xe2\x80\x99 sexual harassment\nvictimization. These findings suggested the relevance of a\nhostile school climate to peer sexual harassment and the\ngender differences in risk factors.\nKeywords Sexual harassment . Peer victimization .\nAdolescents. Taiwan . Middle school\nIntroduction\nIt is well known that students experience various forms of\npeer maltreatment at school (see Smokowski and Kopasz\n2005, for a review of the issue in U.S. schools). Besides\nverbal and physical bullying, many adolescents suffer\nfrequent humiliation, intimidation, unpleasant touch or\neven violent assault of a sexual nature in the educational\nenvironment, which adversely affects their learning and\nwell-being (e.g., Chiodo et al. 2009). To date, most\ninvestigations on school bullying fail to address this\nsubstantial type of victimization, namely peer sexual\nharassment. For example, in a recent comprehensive review\nof existing bullying research drawn from several major\nacademic data bases, only physical, verbal, and relational\nforms of student aggression are discussed (Stassen Berger\n2007). More importantly, existing research on peer sexual\nharassment is largely based on North American (e.g.,\nAmerican Association of University Women 2001;\nMcMaster et al. 2002) and European populations (e.g.,\nTimmerman 2003), and the issue receives significantly less\nrecognition in Asian countries. As an exception, the issue\nof sexual harassment on campus has created much public\nconcern in Taiwan during the past decade (Huang and Bih\n2002). After a number of legal cases gained wide publicity,\nthe Gender Equity Education Act was passed in Taiwan in\n2004 to eliminate discrimination, harassment and unwelcome\nsexual conduct while providing a safe and genderfriendly\nenvironment for students (Chen 2005). The\nlegislation specifically requires the government and educational\ninstitutions to develop programs and policies to\naddress the problem of sexual prejudice and harassment in\nschool (Chiao 2007). However, relevant data from the local\ncontext remains insufficient, preventing a grounded assessment\nof this problem\xe2\x80\x99s prevalence and characteristics.\nH.-S. Wei (*)\nDepartment of Social Work, National Taipei University,\n151 University Rd., San Shia,\nTaipei 237, Taiwan\ne-mail: hswei@mail.ntpu.edu.tw\nJ.-K. Chen\nDepartment of Social Work, Chinese University of Hong Kong,\nHong Kong, China\ne-mail: jkchen@swk.cuhk.edu.hk\nSex Roles (2012) 66:66\xe2\x80\x9378\nDOI 10.1007/s11199-011-0073-7\nThe present study is among the few attempts to\nempirically explore the prevalence and risk factors of\nsexual harassment among Taiwanese adolescents, which\nadds to the existing knowledge about gender issues in\nseveral ways. First, past studies on sexual aggression and\nharassment often assume females to constitute the majority\nof victims, and the victimization of males is rarely assessed.\nFor example, in one study of Canadian young adults\xe2\x80\x99\nreaction to hypothetical confrontations of peer sexual\nharassment, male undergraduates from a Canadian university\nwere asked to read scenarios depicting a hypothetical\nconfrontation by a woman of a male sexual harasser\n(Saunders and Senn 2009), while other possibilities were\nnot fully investigated. A laboratory study of American male\ncollege students examined the predicting factors of gender\nharassment, in which gender harassment was defined as the\nnumber of sexist questions asked of women during a mock\njob interview or negative evaluations of the female\ninterviewee (Hitlan et al. 2009). Yet another U.S. study of\nthe relationship between sexual harassment and empathic\nbias examined men\xe2\x80\x99s sexual harassment toward women but\nnot same-gender targets (Schweinle et al. 2009). However,\nas one recent study on the sexual harassment victimization\nof U.S. young adults showed, men not only do experience\nharassment but such victimizations can impact their\nadjustment and maturity outcomes, and a \xe2\x80\x9cwimpy male\xe2\x80\x9d\nhypothesis was discussed by the authors for explanation\n(Sears et al. 2011). With a large-scale random sample of\nTaiwanese middle school students, this study assessed the\nprevalence of peer sexual harassment victimization among\nboth boys and girls in Taiwan, which is expected to provide\na more accurate picture and advance the current understanding\nof this significant gender issue.\nThe above discussion further suggests the potential\neffects of masculinity in peer sexual harassment, and the\npresent study utilizes the hegemonic masculinity perspective\n(Connell and Messerschmidt 2005) as the theoretical\nframework for exploring the potentially differential factors\nassociated with peer sexual harassment between genders.\nLike delinquency and violence against women, harassment\nis regarded as related to boys\xe2\x80\x99 effort to secure their\nmanhood and contest for peer status (Messerschmidt\n2000), which make themselves to be at high risk of\nvictimization as well. One study on U.S. young adults\nfound that, compared to women, men not only perceived\nmanhood as a more impermanent state than womanhood,\nbut they also endorsed aggression as a means of proving or\nre-establishing threatened manhood (Weaver et al. 2010). At\nthe same time, as discussed later in the text, peer sexual\nharassment victimization is expected to be prevalent among\nlocal adolescents given the classroom structure and cultural\ntradition in Taiwan, with peers and teachers to be significant\nfactors that are often overlooked in past research. To\nevaluate the above potential risk factors of peer sexual\nharassment, the present study employed multivariate logistic\nregression analyses and conducted gender comparison to\nempirically test these hypotheses.\nFinally, the present study addressed the overrepresentation\nof western populations in past research by providing\nvaluable data from an Asian cultural context that has been\nrarely examined before. Having undergone rapid modernization\nduring the past decades, Taiwan is heavily influenced\nby both western culture and its own eastern tradition\n(Yang 1996), which constitutes a unique target for investigation.\nThe traditional Chinese culture in Taiwan has a\nstrong collectivistic orientation, and everyone\xe2\x80\x99s self is\nembedded in social relationships (Yang et al. 2010). One\xe2\x80\x99s\ninteraction with others is governed by his/her social roles in\na hierarchical network, among which husband-wife is one\nof the crucial dyad illustrating gender norms (Jiang 2001).\nThe Confucian tradition endorses notions such as \xe2\x80\x9cmen are\nsuperior and women are inferior\xe2\x80\x9d and emphasizes submissiveness\nand obedience as women\xe2\x80\x99s virtues (Chia et al.\n1994). Women are supposed to depend on men while men\nare expected to achieve a strong personality and leadership\nroles in work and family, which can make them being\nassertive and even aggressive (Kao and Lu 2006). Such a\ngender ideology is conveyed to Taiwanese youngsters via\nfamily, school and peer group, within which men are taught\nto be strong, powerful and tough (Chu 2003; Lee 2007).\nAlthough previous studies have shown increasingly egalitarian\ngender roles among local people as a result of\nwesternization (Chia et al. 1997), sexism remains salient in\nTaiwan with its cultural roots (Lee et al. 2007). Such\nfindings reveal a potential hotbed for sexual harassment to\ngrow. In fact, existing data highlight the seriousness of the\nissue in Taiwan. One survey with a sample of 308 students\nfrom one junior high school in Taiwan showed that 77% of\nthe students had suffered at least one form of sexual\nharassment during their time at the school (Huang and Yen\n2004). Another qualitative study on Taiwanese elementary\nschool students aged 10 and 12 revealed the existence of\nverbal and physical sexual harassment among local adolescents\n(Chang et al. 2010). In response to this potential\nthreat to the wellbeing of Taiwanese youth, the present\nstudy aims to promote awareness in the academic community\nabout the seriousness of the problem in an Asian\ncontext and extend a cross-cultural understanding of sexual\nharassment victimization among adolescents.\nPrevalence of Peer Sexual Harassment\nSexual harassment is generally defined as unwelcome\nrequests or unacceptable conduct of a sexual nature that\nmay interfere with one\xe2\x80\x99s life and threaten his/her rights to\nemployment and education (Lichty et al. 2008). Being\nSex Roles (2012) 66:66\xe2\x80\x9378 67\nsexually harassed by peers in educational settings may\nresult in a variety of negative consequences. One study of\nU.S. adolescents found sexual harassment victimization to\nbe associated with lower self-esteem, poor physical and\nmental health, and trauma symptoms (Gruber and Fineran\n2008). As one form of peer maltreatment, sexual harassment\nis a prevalent experience among adolescents. A\nsurvey of 2,064 U.S. public school students in grades\n8 through 12 found that 81% of the students had\nexperienced some form of sexual harassment at some time\nduring their school years (American Association of University\nWomen 2001). One study in the Netherlands of\n2,808 randomly selected adolescents aged 14\xe2\x80\x9315 at 22\nsecondary schools found that 18% of the respondents had\nexperienced unwanted sexual behavior during the previous\n12 months (Timmerman 2003). Another study on 1,734\nstudents from 23 Canadian schools showed that sexualharassment\nvictimization was common among both boys\n(42.4%) and girls (44.1%) in grade 9 (Chiodo et al. 2009).\nUsing a representative sample of 10,400 students in grades\n7 through II from public schools in Israel, one survey found\n29.1% of the students were victims of at least one act of\nsexual harassment in school during the prior month (Zeira\net al. 2002).\nData on the prevalence of sexual harassment in\nAsian countries is relatively limited. Using a large\nsample of 4,956 adolescents in Hong Kong, one survey\nfound that 23% of the primary school students (P.4-P.6)\nand 43% of the secondary school students (F.1-F.7) had\never been sexually harassed or abused by peers (Tang\n2004), which highlights the significance of the issue in\nAsian contexts.\nBoys are found generally more involved in the perpetration\nof peer sexual harassment (e.g. American Association\nof University Women 2006). Regarding the gender\ndistribution of the victims in peer sexual harassment, some\nstudies on U.S. (Hand and Sanchez 2000; Berger and\nRodkin 2009; AAUW 2001; Ormerod et al. 2008) and\nNetherlands students (Timmerman 2005) have suggested\nthat girls experience more frequent and severe peer sexual\nharassment than do boys. Other studies on Canadian\n(McMaster et al. 2002) and U.S. adolescents (Pellegrini\n2001; Gruber and Fineran 2008), however, have shown no\ngender difference in victimization prevalence. Yet another\nset of studies has found a higher prevalence of\nvictimization in boys, including one on Israeli public\nschool students (Zeira et al. 2002) and one on U.S.\nadolescents from 5th to 9th grade (Petersen and Hyde\n2009). At the same time, studies of Canadian (Williams et\nal. 2005) and U.S. students (Gruber and Fineran 2008)\nfound sexual/gender minority youth at greater risks of\nbeing bullied and sexually harassed. One study specifically\non lesbian, gay, bisexual and questioning adolescents\nfrom U.S. high schools revealed the prevalence of\nheterosexism and homophobia as well as harassment\ntoward LGBQ students (Chesir-Teran and Hughes 2009).\nHowever, the above findings are mostly from western\nsamples, and their applicability to other contexts awaits\nfurther investigation.\nMasculinity and Peer Sexual Harassment\nTheories of sexual harassment often emphasize its sociocultural\nroots and functions. From the hegemonic masculinity\nperspective (e.g., Connell and Messerschmidt 2005),\nsexual harassment enforces gender hierarchy and status\ndifferential through the humiliation of victims. The issue of\nmasculinity is particularly salient with regard to sexual\nharassment among adolescents. One study of the life\nhistories of U.S. adolescent male offenders found that the\nprevalent masculinity ideology requires young men to be\naggressive, dominant, tough, and to depreciate effeminacy,\nwhich increase their risk of committing harassment and\nsexual violence toward women (Messerschmidt 2000).\nAnother study on African American youth showed that\nmale adolescents often use physical and verbal sexual\nharassment to highlight their power and superiority over\nfemale peers (Miller 2008). It is suggested that such\npractices represent a general climate of male dominance\nand disrespect toward women in the larger American\nsociety in which schools are embedded (Haywood and\nMac an Ghaill 1996). It is, therefore, tempting to assume\ngirls to be the major victims of peer sexual harassment.\nHowever, as suggested by researchers in the United States\n(Ferguson 2000; Kimmel 1996), the United Kingdom (Mac\nan Ghaill 1994), and Australia (Poynting and Donaldson\n2005), masculinity should be viewed as an achieved\nrather than an ascribed status, and adolescent boys are\nin a constant need to contest with each other and prove\ntheir manhood within the male group. One study\nconducted in-depth interviews with male students in an\nU.S. high school and found the boys\xe2\x80\x99 interaction with\nother boys to be characterized by provocative behaviors,\nsuch as teasing, taunting, and mocking of a sexualized\nnature (Oransky and Marecek 2009). Another study on\nU.S. middle school and high school students revealed that\nby \xe2\x80\x98feminizing\xe2\x80\x99 other boys through bullying and harassment,\none can bolster his masculinity and gain power\nwithin the peer group (Phillips 2007). Furthermore,\nanalyses of the male interaction in U.S. schools suggested\nthat while these peer disciplining practices produce\nanxiety, fear and hurt, they also bring friendship, intimacy,\nand bonding for the boys (Stoudt 2006; Lyman 1992).\nSimilarly, it has been shown that hegemonic masculinity\nideology impacts adolescent boys from Pacific Islander\nand Asian American backgrounds as well, leading them to\n68 Sex Roles (2012) 66:66\xe2\x80\x9378\nfrequently use violence to enhance their peer status\n(Mayeda and Pasko 2011).\nThe relevance between peer sexual harassment and\nmasculinity found in the above studies seems to bear a\nsimilarity to the research findings on Taiwanese adolescents.\nIn an ethnographic study, Guo (2007) described a\ncommon play behavior among Taiwanese male adolescents,\nin which a group of boys lifted the victim and hit or rubbed\nhis reproductive organ against a hard object. This is\nrecognized as a form of masculine friendship expression\nand a reaffirmation of masculinity, although the victim may\nfeel humiliated and harassed. Taiwanese male adolescents\nthus seem to adopt harassment as peer disciplining practice\nof masculinity as well, which have a sexualized nature and\ninflicts both distress and affiliation on themselves. Another\nrecent study interviewed Taiwanese juvenile offenders and\nfound that their masculinity ideologies reflect notions of\ntoughness, fighting, degrading women, and homophobia\n(Hsu 2008). Their life stories revealed that violence and\nharassment are common ways for these delinquent youth to\nestablish their manhood. In addition, a study on Taiwanese\n5th grade students showed that the peer group had\ncrucial influence on male adolescents\xe2\x80\x99 gender ideology\nand their interaction with male and female classmates\n(Tien 2004). The male students were found to mostly\nassociate with same-gender peers and their group norms\nwere characterized by aggressiveness, competition with\nother males, and prejudice toward females. The author\nobserved that besides initiating provocations toward\nfemale classmates, these boys often mock and harass their\nmore feminine or weak male peers to confirm masculine\nnorms and gain status within the group. Such practices\nresemble the findings from North American youth mentioned\nabove (e.g., Oransky and Marecek 2009; Phillips\n2007) and suggest similarity of the underlying gender\ndynamics among male adolescents.\nIndividual and Interpersonal Risk Factors\nSeveral risk factors of peer sexual harassment in the\nindividual and interpersonal levels have been identified by\nthe empirical literature, which lend support to the above\ndiscussion on masculinity dynamics. First, girls are not the\nonly possible targets of sexual harassment. Boys may also\nbe sexually harassed by peers in their competition for\nmasculinity. In a longitudinal study on Canadian high\nschool students, boys reported receiving more homosexual\nslurs or unwanted sexual content, while girls reported\nreceiving more sexual jokes, comments, and unwanted\ntouching (Chiodo et al. 2009). One study on U.S. students\nfurther showed that the boys suffered more same-gender\nharassment than do girls (Petersen and Hyde 2009). Similar\nresults were shown by one study on Taiwanese adolescents,\nin which not only more boys than girls were found sexually\nharassed by peers, but both boys and girls reported \xe2\x80\x9cmale\nclassmates or friends\xe2\x80\x9d as the perpetrators of harassment\n(Huang and Yen 2004). Such findings reveal the potential\nhigh risk of male-to-male harassment among students.\nSince Taiwanese adolescents in the middle school years\nare shown to interact mostly with same-gender peers (Hsieh\net al. 2006; Tien 2004), and same-gender harassment are\nfound prevalent among boys (Guo 2007; Tien 2004), it was\nhypothesized in this study that Taiwanese middle-school\nboys receive more sexual harassment victimization than do\ngirls.\nA major set of individual risk factors associated with\npeer victimization and harassment is antisocial behaviors.\nOne study on U.S. adolescents showed delinquency and\ncrime to be risk factors of school-based sexual victimization\n(Tillyer et al. 2010). As studies on American youth and\nadults reveal, themes of aggression, power and \xe2\x80\x9crulebreaking\xe2\x80\x9d\nare often emphasized in masculinity ideologies\n(e.g., Kulis et al. 2010; Walters 2001), and involvement in\nthese high-risk activities increases one\xe2\x80\x99s likelihood of being\nvictimized. Delinquency, such as school truancy, substance\nuse, and other deviant behaviors, is frequently found\nassociated with victimization among U.S. adolescents\n(Gastic 2008; Rusby et al. 2005). In their study of a sample\nof 1,532 U.S. high school students, Fineran and Bolen\n(2006) suggested a direct relationship between delinquency\n(fighting, stealing, and vandalizing property) and peer\nsexual-harassment victimization. Lacasse and Mendelson\n(2007) surveyed 116 Canadian adolescents in grades\n8 through 11 and showed that victims of peer sexual\ncoercion reported more drug/alcohol use and non-sexual\ndeviance (starting fights, running away from home, etc.)\nthan the control group. This again highlighted the close\nrelationship between the risk of deviance and victimization.\nIn fact, one study on Taiwanese junior high school\nstudents similarly showed that delinquent behaviors such\nas drinking, running away and truancy were associated\nwith higher risk of sexual harassment/assault victimization\n(Hsieh 2007). Since delinquency and violence are more\nassociated with masculinity rather than femininity, and\nsuch associations are found not only in North American\nsocieties but also in the local context of Taiwan (e.g., Hsu\n2008; Bih 2000; Hsu and Cheng 2007), it is expected in\nthe present study that these factors are more relevant to\nTaiwanese boys\xe2\x80\x99 risk of peer sexual harassment victimization\nthan to girls\xe2\x80\x99 risk.\nOn the interpersonal level, the risk to victims of peer\nmaltreatment often lies in their relationship problems with\npeers. Studies on U.S. youth showed that lack of friends\nand poor peer status were associated with multiple forms of\npeer victimization (Wang et al. 2009; Berger and Rodkin\n2009; Nansel et al. 2001). In their recent study on\nSex Roles (2012) 66:66\xe2\x80\x9378 69\nTaiwanese junior high school students, Wei and Chen\n(2009) also found the association between peer rejection\nand victimization. At the same time, experiencing school\nbullying itself is a risk factor of sexual harassment. Studies\non U.S. adolescents found that the victims of sexual\nharassment are likely to be physically and verbally bullied\n(Felix and McMahon 2007; Fineran and Bolen 2006).\nHowever, although past research showed that multiple\nforms of harassment overlap for both boys and girls, they\nmay not reflect the same peer issues across gender. As\ndiscussed above, rough treatment is often a masculine way\nto express friendship and affiliation between boys as\nrevealed by studies in the United States as well as Taiwan\n(e.g., Reed and Brown 2001; Guo 2007), which does not\nequally apply to girls. Boys therefore may be more tolerant\ntoward such behaviors and less regard themselves as\nrejected by peers. Given the existing evidence, it is\nhypothesized that the experience of being bullied relates\nto both boys\xe2\x80\x99 and girls\xe2\x80\x99 risk of peer sexual harassment but\nthat girls who are sexually harassed are more likely to\nperceive themselves as having peer relationship problems.\nFinally, one often overlooked social context in peer\nsexual harassment is teacher-student interaction. Maltreatment\nby school staff is found associated with student\naggression and sexual harassment among U.S. (Ormerod et\nal. 2008) as well as Israeli students (Khoury-Kassabri 2009;\nAttar-Schwartz 2009). As significant role models, teachers\ncan shape students\xe2\x80\x99 attitudes and behaviors toward peers.\nOne U.K. study showed that school teachers often act as\n\xe2\x80\x98cultural accomplices\xe2\x80\x99 and consolidate the norms of\nhegemonic masculinity among adolescents (Smith 2007).\nThe issue of teacher maltreatment is particularly relevant to\nschools in Taiwan due to its Confucian heritage. The local\ntraditional culture has deep roots in Confucian philosophy,\nand it is still influential in shaping the school context and\nteacher-student relationship in Taiwan (Tu and Hung 2008;\nYen and Hwang 2011). In educational settings, Confucian\nbeliefs emphasize hierarchy, obedience and respect for\nteachers (Ho and Ho 2008). As a result, teachers in Taiwan\nare highly regarded as a parent-like figure and a symbol of\nauthority whose conduct sets a crucial model for students\nto imitate (Fwu and Wang 2002). However, one recent\nsurvey in Taiwan showed that 26.9% of middle school\nstudents reported having been maltreated by teachers at\nleast once in the previous semester, with hitting, beating or\nslapping being the most common maltreatment (Chen and\nWei 2011). More specifically, another study of Taiwanese\njunior high school students found the teachers\xe2\x80\x99 harsh\npunishment and indifference to students were associated\nwith higher risk of sexual harassment and assault among\nadolescents (Hsieh 2007). It is likely that hostile teacher\ntreatment serves both as a behavioral example for students\nand a contributor for negative school climate, which in turn\nincreases the tendency of sexual harassment and victimization\namong all students, boys and girls alike. The\npotential effect of this factor is examined in the present\nstudy.\nThe Present Study\nPeer sexual harassment is a common experience among\nadolescents, but it is considerably under-studied compared\nto other types of peer maltreatment, not to mention the lack\nof extensive research in Asian contexts. This study,\ntherefore, hopes to bridge the knowledge gap in the existing\nliterature and provide a large-scale assessment along with\nan exploration of the potential risk factors of peer sexualharassment\nvictimization among adolescents in an Asian\ncontext. Specifically, it aims at testing the following\nresearch hypotheses derived from the literature:\nH1 Boys experience higher peer sexual harassment than\ndo girls.\nH2 Delinquent behaviors (getting into fights, theft, and\ndrinking) are positively associated with sexual harassment\nvictimization for the boys only.\nH3 Peer relationship problems are positively associated\nwith sexual harassment victimization for girls only.\nH4 Being bullied is positively associated with sexual\nharassment victimization for both boys and girls.\nH5 Experience of teacher maltreatment is positively\nassociated with sexual harassment victimization for\nboth boys and girls.\nMethod\nSample\nThe Taichung City Youth Life Conditions Survey is a\nlarge-scale survey funded by the Children\xe2\x80\x99s Bureau to\ncollect information on the life circumstances and service\nneeds of local adolescents. The present study used the\nmiddle-school dataset of 2006, which consisted of a total\nof 1,376 students from 14 public and private middle\nschools (grades 7\xe2\x80\x939) in the area. A two-stage cluster\nsampling strategy was employed, in which two schools\nwere first randomly selected from each of the districts in\nTaichung City (except from one district that has no middle\nschools). In each of the selected schools, one class from\neach grade was subsequently chosen at random to\nparticipate in the study, which resulted in a final sample\nof 42 classes. All the students in the classes were included\nas participants, with 50.7% (n=698) boys and 49.3%\n(n=678) girls. They were fairly evenly distributed over\ngrades 7\xe2\x80\x939 (464, 441, and 471 respectively).\n70 Sex Roles (2012) 66:66\xe2\x80\x9378\nProcedure\nThe project was approved through the internal review\nprocess of the Children\xe2\x80\x99s Bureau and conducted in\naccordance with its ethical guidelines. The homeroom\nteachers of the selected classes were informed of the study\nin summer 2006 and asked to assist in administering the\nquestionnaire. The survey packs were distributed to\nteachers in the middle of the fall semester. Students\ncompleted the self-reported, anonymous inventory in their\nclassrooms during a regular class period. Instructions were\nprovided and respondents were explicitly informed that\nthey were free to withdraw at any time in the process\nwithout any cost. Confidentiality was ensured and the\nquestionnaires were sealed upon completion in blank\nenvelopes, which were collected shortly afterward.\nMeasures\nSexual Harassment\nStudents\xe2\x80\x99 experience of sexual-harassment victimization by\npeers during the last semester was assessed with two items:\n\xe2\x80\x9cA student made sexual remarks or jokes you did not want\xe2\x80\x9d\nand \xe2\x80\x9cA student touched or caressed you against your will\xe2\x80\x9d\n(see Appendix). The two items corresponded to the verbal\nand physical dimensions of adolescent sexual harassment\nidentified by past research in Europe (Ortega et al. 2010)\nand Taiwan (Chang et al. 2010). A 5-point Likert scale was\nprovided (never, 1\xe2\x80\x932 times, 3\xe2\x80\x934 times, 5\xe2\x80\x936 times, 7 times or\nmore). Due to the considerable skewness of the distribution,\nthe scores on the two items were combined and dichotomized\n(r=.38). The binary values were then used in logistic\nregression to compare those who did and did not have the\nexperience.\nGender\nThe first part of the survey questionnaire inquired about\nthe respondent\xe2\x80\x99s demographics. Information on student\xe2\x80\x99s\ngender was obtained for the present analysis (see\nAppendix). Gender was a dichotomous variable (male,\nfemale).\nDelinquency\nStudents were asked whether they had engaged in three\nkinds of common delinquent behaviors (getting into\nfights, theft, and drinking) during the last year (see\nAppendix). Since the original items were dichotomous\n(yes/no), the scores on each of the items were used as\nseparate predictors for sexual harassment victimization in\nthe regression model.\nPeer Relationship Problems\nStudents were asked whether they had problems in peer\nrelationships in their daily life (yes/no) (see Appendix). The\nitem was used as a dichotomous predictor for sexual\nharassment victimization in the regression model.\nExperience of Being Bullied\nStudents\xe2\x80\x99 experiences of physical and verbal victimization\nby peers during the last semester were measured with 5\nitems on a five-point scale (never\xe2\x80\x947 times or more). These\nitems were adapted from both the school violence scale in\nTaiwan and the California School Climate and Safety\nSurvey (Furlong et al. 2005). The original items were\ntranslated from English to Chinese, followed by a standard\nback-translation procedure to ensure translation accuracy.\nItems included \xe2\x80\x9cStudents in school hit you\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cStudents\nin school threaten you\xe2\x80\x9d (see Appendix). The Cronbach\nalpha was .72.\nTeacher Maltreatment\nFour items were used to assess students\xe2\x80\x99 experience of\nphysical and verbal maltreatment by school teachers during\nthe last semester (see Appendix). A 5-point Likert scale was\nprovided (never, 1\xe2\x80\x932 times, 3\xe2\x80\x934 times, 5\xe2\x80\x936 times, 7 times or\nmore). Items included \xe2\x80\x9cTeachers or staff in school hit you\xe2\x80\x9d,\n\xe2\x80\x9cTeachers or staff in school kick you\xe2\x80\x9d, and \xe2\x80\x9cTeachers or\nstaff in school say bad words or swear at you\xe2\x80\x9d (\xce\xb1=.68).\nResults\nOverall, 25.4% of the respondents reported ever being\nsexually harassed by peers during the previous semester.\n26.1% of the boys and 20.4% of the girls had received\nsexual remarks or jokes they did not want, while 8.5% of\nthe boys and 5.3% of the girls had been touched or caressed\nagainst their will (see Table 1). The scores on the two items\nwere combined and dichotomized to create a composite\nmeasure. As an initial analytic procedure, a MANOVA was\nconducted to examine the potential gender differences in all\nthe continuous variables (see Table 2). Chi-square tests\nwere also performed for the dichotomous variables (see\nTable 3). The overall MANOVA analysis for gender was\nfound significant (Wilks\xe2\x80\x99 Lambda = .95, F=18.40, p<.01).\nIt was hypothesized that boys receive higher peer sexual\nharassment than do girls (H1), and the results of MANOVA\nand chi-square test confirmed the first prediction. Boys\nscored higher on verbal and physical sexual harassment\nvictimization than did girls (F=11.26 and 8.86, p<.01), and\ntheir victimization rate was also significantly higher than\nSex Roles (2012) 66:66\xe2\x80\x9378 71\nthat of girls (X^2=7.73, df=1, N=1,376, p=.01). In\naddition, boys had significantly higher scores than girls on\nexperience of being bullied and teacher maltreatment\n(F=64.90 and 28.52, p<.01). The percentages of boys\nhaving the experiences of getting into fights and theft were\nalso significantly higher than those of girls. The percentage\nof girls having peer relationship problems was significantly\nhigher than boys, and no significant gender difference was\nfound in drinking.\nMultivariate logistic regression analysis was performed\nseparately on boys and girls to examine potential gender\ndifferences in the effects of the risk factors. Multicollinearity\ndiagnosis was computed, and the tolerance and\nVIF values indicated no sign of collinearity between the\nindependent variables. Since the research variables are\nconceptually linked and can be grouped into two blocks, a\nhierarchical approach was adopted to assess the strength\nof the individual- and interpersonal-level factors in a\nstepwise manner. The individual-level variables of delinquent\nbehaviors were entered first, followed by the\ninterpersonal predictors (peer relationship problems, being\nbullied and teacher maltreatment). The results of the final\nregression models for boys and girls are summarized in\nTable 4. On the individual level, it was hypothesized that\ndelinquent behaviors were expected to be positively\nassociated with sexual harassment victimization for boys\nonly (H2). In partial support of H2, the odds ratio of\ngetting into fights was significant for boys only (OR=\n1.50, p=.05). Theft and drinking were not significantly\nassociated with sexual harassment victimization for both\ngenders.\nOn the interpersonal level, it was hypothesized that peer\nrelationship problems were associated with sexual harassment\nonly for girls (H3), which was supported by the\nresults (OR=1.53, p=.05 for girls and OR=1.09, p=.69\nfor boys). Finally, experience of being bullied and teacher\nmaltreatment were both expected to be positively associated\nwith peer sexual harassment for both genders (H4 and\nH5), and the results of logistic regression lent support for\nboth hypotheses (see Table 4). The Nagelkerke R Squares\nof the final regression model for boys and girls were\ncalculated as both .20.\nDiscussion\nPeer sexual harassment is a common form of victimization\namong adolescents. Its negative effects on students\xe2\x80\x99 health\nand school adjustment have raised serious public concerns\nin recent years. Still, empirical investigation on the issue\nremains relatively limited in number, especially in Asian\ncontexts. This study is likely among the first attempts to\nconduct a systematic assessment of peer sexual harassment\nin Taiwan with a large-scale, random sample of adolescents.\nThe results showed that one-fourth of the students (25.4%)\nhad experienced some sexual harassment during the last\nsemester. This number is lower than those in some previous\nstudies mentioned above (e.g., American Association of\nUniversity Women 2001; Chiodo et al. 2009). Such a\ndiscrepancy can be partly explained by differences in time\nframe adopted and specific behaviors measured. Instead of\nTable 1 Peer sexual harassment victimization divided by gender\nNever 1-2 times 3-4 times 5-6 times 7 times or more\nA student made sexual remarks or jokes you did not want Boys 516(73.9%) 79(11.4%) 34(4.9%) 12(1.7%) 57(8.2%)\nGirls 540(79.6%) 74(10.9%) 28(4.1%) 7(1.0%) 29(4.3%)\nA student touched or caressed you against your will Boys 639(91.5%) 36(5.2%) 8(1.1%) 3(0.4%) 12(1.7%)\nGirls 642(94.7%) 30(4.4%) 4(0.6%) 0(0.0%) 2(0.3%)\nTotal number of boys = 698.

Nonetheless, this\nprevalence is fairly high and may have a variety of\npsychosocial consequences on the well-being and development\nof the local students.\nThe finding that boys reported higher rates of victimization\nof both verbal and physical sexual harassment\nhighlights an often overlooked victim population in sexual\nharassment literature. In fact, such results have been\nreflected in a number of previous studies discussed above\n(Zeira et al. 2002; Petersen and Hyde 2009; Huang and Yen\n2004). Since boys are more likely to be the perpetrators of\nsexual harassment, it raises the issue of same-gender peer\nvictimization among boys, which may have different\nqualities to cross-gender harassment. In reviewing the\nproblem of peer sexual harassment in the United States,\nFineran (2002) suggested that masculinity ideology and\nheterosexism are evident in these abusive incidents. As a\ngendered practice of consolidating social dominance, such\naggression usually happens between same-gender peers.\nOne ethnographic study in Taiwanese middle schools\nTable 3 Chi-Square test results for gender differences in sexual harassment victimization and dichotomous factors\nYes No df Chi-Square p-value\nGetting into fights Boys 190(27.2%) 508(72.8%) 1 94.07 .00*\nGirls 50(7.4%) 628(92.6%)\nTheft Boys 52(7.4%) 646(92.6%) 1 7.64 .01*\nGirls 27(4.0%) 651(96.0%)\nDrinking Boys 111(15.9%) 587(84.1%) 1 .00 .95\nGirls 107(15.8%) 571(84.2%)\nPeer relationship problem Boys 148(21.2%) 550(78.8%) 1 16.10 .00*\nGirls 208(30.7%) 470(69.3%)\nSexual harassment victimization (dichotomized) Boys 200(28.7%) 498(71.3%) 1 7.73 .01*\nGirls 150(22.1%) 528(77.9%)\n*significant at .05 level\nTotal number of boys = 698.

The present study did not ask respondents about the\ngender of their perpetrators, and therefore it is difficult to\nseparate same-gender and cross-gender harassment. Further\ninvestigation is needed to clarify this issue.\nThe present study also found that fighting as a\ndelinquent behavior was related to victimization for boys.\nThis result echoed certain previous studies on U.S.\nadolescents (Fineran and Bolen 2006; Espelage and Holt\n2007), suggesting the relevance of delinquency to sexual\nharassment victimization. In fact, the overlap of deviant\nbehaviors and victimization has been long recognized in the\nschool bullying research done in Netherlands (Veenstra et\nal. 2005), South Korea (Schwartz et al. 2002), and Taiwan\n(Chen and Astor 2010). As the results of this study showed,\nthis association is significant only for the boys, which may\nbe regarded as a negative consequence of confirming\nmasculine norms. Among the common delinquent behaviors\nthat include drinking, theft, and fighting, involvement\nin fights had the most salient relevance to boys\xe2\x80\x99 sexual\nharassment, which makes sense since such aggressive acts\ncan better express one\xe2\x80\x99s confirmation of hegemonic\nmasculinity while raising their risk of victimization at the\nsame time. Although antisocial behaviors such as juvenile\ndelinquency are means of achieving masculinity for\nadolescent boys, some studies on U.S. youth have found\nthat these strategies may become problematic and get them\ninto troubles later in adulthood (Sanders 2011; Brown and\nBurton 2010).\nUnlike youth in many of the western countries, the\nmiddle school students in Taiwan stay in a homeroom with\na fixed group of classmates everyday during their entire\nschool years. As a result, Taiwanese adolescents are more\noften victimized by their classmates than by outside\nstudents (Wei et al. 2007). At the same time, such class\narrangements make peer acceptance and class climate\nparticularly important contexts for students\xe2\x80\x99 school experience.\nThe present study showed that self-perceived peer\nrelationship problem was a significant risk factor for the\ngirls but not for the boys. It was consistent with the fact that\nharassment between males is not necessarily a sign of peer\nrejection. Instead, harassment and victimization can be\nexpressions of friendship and bonding in some circumstances.\nSuch dynamics do not apply equally to girls\xe2\x80\x99\nvictimization. One study of U.S. college students found that\nmen were more likely than women to playfully punch and\nshove same-gender friends while women\xe2\x80\x99s playful aggression\noften targeted men (Gergen 1990), reflecting the\ndifferent meaning of such behaviors. It may be the reason\nwhy girls perceive the acts of harassment as more harmful\nand upsetting than do boys (Gruber and Fineran 2008).\nIn addition, being bullied and suffering teacher maltreatment\nwere significant risk factors of peer sexual harassment\nfor both genders. These seemingly diverse kinds of\naggression may reflect unified, underlying dynamics such\nas a negative class climate and the existence of an\naggressive culture. The results of this study thus endorsed\nthe significant effect of a hostile and unfriendly school\nenvironment in adolescents\xe2\x80\x99 risk of being maltreated and\nharassed by peers. Research on U.S. adolescents has\nsuggested the direct and indirect contribution of school\npersonnel in the perpetration of student victimization and\nharassment (e.g., Pellegrini 2002). Furthermore, sexual\nharassment by teachers is a potential issue that was not\nanalyzed in the present study (Timmerman 2003). Teacher\nharassment can not only inflict direct harm to the students,\nbut their misconduct is also likely to promote sexualharassment\nbetween peers. Teachers have a great influence\non the classroom climate and serve as role models for\nchildren. Studies of Taiwanese adolescents showed that\nstudent-teacher relationships and abusive practices by\nteachers contribute to students\xe2\x80\x99 aggressive behavior and\ndelinquency (Chen and Astor 2011; Wei et al. 2010). School\nadministrators, therefore, may need to pay special attention\nto victimization of students by teachers, since it not only\ncauses direct psychological impact but may also stimulate\npeer aggression.\nAlthough this study showed a substantial prevalence of\npeer sexual-harassment victimization among Taiwanese\nadolescents, the number is better regarded as an underestimation.\nOnly two kinds of sexual harassment were\nassessed, while other forms of gender/sexuality-related\nvictimization were not included, which is a limitation of\nthe present study. In particular, the potential vulnerability of\nsexual/gender minority students was not assessed. They\noften suffer physical, verbal, relational and other forms of\nabuse and exclusion at school. Research on U.S. (Huebner\net al. 2004) and Canadian adolescents (Williams et al. 2003)\nhas shown that gender minorities often experience multiple\nforms of peer victimization. The survey battery of this\nstudy contained one item asking whether the respondents\nhad distress with regard to sexuality. Students who checked\n\xe2\x80\x9cyes\xe2\x80\x9d (n=24) were mostly boys, and they had higher scores\non the two sexual harassment victimization items than their\npeers who checked no, which implies the potential impact\nof masculinity dynamics. Given the extremely limited\nnumber of cases, no conclusive assertion can be drawn,\nbut such findings suggest a direction worthy of future\ninvestigation. In addition, the current data is cross-sectional\nin nature, and further longitudinal investigations are needed\nto evaluate the causality of the variables.\nNonetheless, this study, with its large-scale, random\nsample, provides valuable information on the issue of peer\nsexual harassment in Taiwan and examines the risk factors\n74 Sex Roles (2012) 66:66\xe2\x80\x9378\nassociated with victimization. A number of studies on\nCanadian youth suggested that a heterotypic continuity\nexists in an individual\xe2\x80\x99s aggressive behaviors, such as\nbullying, sexual harassment, dating aggression, workplace\nharassment, domestic violence, and elder abuse (Miller et\nal. 2009; Pepler et al. 2006). It is thus crucial to address\nminor forms of aggression and victimization in order to\nprevent more serious violence and maltreatment. This study\nalso revealed the effects of school violence on students\xe2\x80\x99 risk\nof being sexually harassed. Traditionally, schools have\nimplemented harsh punishments or interventions targeted\nsolely at the perpetrators of these incidents. Based on the\nfindings of this study, it is suggested that attention should\nalso be put on the victims, as well as the social context of\nthese incidents. A hostile environment with prevalent\nbullying may increase students\xe2\x80\x99 risk of being sexually\nharassed. It simultaneously establishes the normality of\nviolence and affects the victims\xe2\x80\x99 perception of, and\nresponse to, harassment. For example, one study of 1,531\nHong Kong secondary school students showed that the\nboys\xe2\x80\x99 own protective behaviors against peer sexual harassment\nwere strongly affected by their perception of how their\nfriends would react in the situation (Li et al. 2010). In\naddition, the issue of hegemonic masculinity in school\nshould be addressed. Conflict resolution and social skills\ntraining can be implemented, as well as befriending\nprograms and a diversity awareness curriculum. Besides\npeer support, one Israeli study found assistance from\nteachers may also decrease victimization (Marachi et al.\n2007). One study on U.S. adolescents found teacher\xe2\x80\x93student\ncloseness to be associated with a decline in children\xe2\x80\x99s\nexternalizing behavior, especially for children with the highest\nproblem levels (Silver et al. 2005). Teachers should establish\nthemselves as caring and non-abusive role models, creating a\nfriendly and gender-sensitive classroom climate in an effort\nto reduce peer harassment and maintain a safe learning\nenvironment for all students.\nAppendix\nSexual harassment victimization during last

aS'Sexual harassment among adolescents of different sexual\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nThis article examines (a) variation in rates of sexual harassment acrossmode (e.g., in-person,\nonline) and type of harassment, (b) the impact of sexual harassment (i.e., distressing vs.\nnon-distressing), and (c) how sexual harassment is similarly and differently experienced\nacross sexual orientation and gender identity groups. Data were collected as part of the\nTeen Health and Technology online survey of 5,907 13 to 18 year-old Internet users in the\nUnited States. Past year sexual harassment was reported by 23\xe2\x80\x9372% of youth, depending\nupon sexual orientation, with the highest rates reported by lesbian/queer girls (72%), bisexual\ngirls (66%), and gay/queer boys (66%). When examined by gender identity, transgender\nyouth reported the highest rates of sexual harassment \xe2\x80\x93 81%. Overall, the most common\nmodes for sexual harassment were in-person followed by online. Distress in the form of\ninterference with school, family, and/or friends; creating a hostile environment; or being\nvery/extremely upset was reported by about half of the sexually harassed bisexual girls and\nlesbian/queer girls, 65% of the gender non-conforming/other gender youth, and 63% of the\ntransgender youth. Youth with high social support and self-esteem were less likely to report\nsexual harassment. Findings point to the great importance of sexual harassment prevention\nfor all adolescents, with particular emphasis on the unique needs and experiences of\nyouth of different sexual orientations and gender identities. Socio-emotional programs that\nemphasize self-esteem building could be particularly beneficial for reducing the likelihood\nof victimization and lessen the impact when it occurs.\n\xc2\xa9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This significant adolescent health\nissue is common in adolescence. One national survey suggested 2.8% of youth (ages 10\xe2\x80\x9313) and 9.3% of youth (ages 14\xe2\x80\x9317)\nin the United States were sexually harassed in the past year; 15.8% of 14 to 17 year-olds report ever experiencing sexual\nharassment (Finkelhor, Turner, Shattuck, & Hamby, 2013). Higher rates were reported as part of the American Association\nof University Women (AAUW) survey in 2001: 81% of students experienced some form of sexual harassment during their\n The project described was supported by Award Number R01 HD057191 from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.

A longitudinal study of 5th, 7th, and 9th graders in Wisconsin found past year rates of peer sexual\nharassment victimization increases with age from 38% of 5th grade girls to 78% of 9th grade boys (Petersen & Hyde, 2009).\nThe Definition of Sexual Harassment\nBecause of diverse legal, sociological, feminist, and psychological perspectives, a universal definition of sexual harassment\ndoes not exist (McMaster, Connolly, Pepler, & Craig, 2002), and thus, rates of sexual harassment vary widely across studies.\nAs with any form of victimization, types of sexual harassment range from minor forms, such as sexual jokes and comments,\nto severe forms, including sexual assault. The legal definition requires the harassment to create a hostile environment (U.S.\nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission, n.d.). Sexual harassment is not limited to face-to-face interactions; indeed,\nsuch victimization can also occur through the Internet and text messaging (Barak, 2005; Ybarra, 2003; Ybarra, Espelage, &\nMitchell, 2007; Ybarra, Mitchell, & Korchmaros, 2011).\nIn the current study, we take a broad approach to ensure we are capturing all possible forms of sexual harassment. We\ndefine sexual harassment as unwanted sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and sexual comments or gestures that\noccur in any environment.\nThe Importance of Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity\nLesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) youth seem to be particularly at risk for sexual harassment: 71% of gay,\nlesbian, bisexual, and questioning middle and high school students in the northeastern United States reported being sexually\nharassed during the school year compared to 32% of their heterosexual counterparts (Gruber & Fineran, 2008). A metaanalysis\nof the victimization experiences of lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals (adolescents and adults) across 386 studies\nbetween 1992 and 2009 found 50% of LGB individuals in the United States experienced sexual harassment (Katz-Wise & Hyde,\n2012). Among Canadian adolescents, sexual minority and questioning youth were also more likely than heterosexual youth\nto be victims of peer sexual harassment (Williams, Connolly, Pepler, & Craig, 2003). Similar findings have been documented\nby other researchers (Fineran, 2001; Williams, Connolly, Pepler, & Craig, 2005).\nBiological sex also seems to play a role in risk for sexual harassment. Females experience sexual harassment differently\nfrom males (Chiodo et al., 2009a) and more frequently: 13.6% of females ages 14\xe2\x80\x9317 years reported past year sexual harassment\ncompared to 4.7% of their male counterparts among a national sample of youth in the United States; lifetime rates were\n21.2% for adolescent females and 10.8% for adolescent males (Finkelhor et al., 2013). Females are more likely to be put down,\nobjectified, or treated differently because of their sex (Lindberg, Grabe, & Hyde, 2007), whereas males are more likely to\nexperience vulgar and homophobic comments (McMaster et al., 2002). Females also experience more of the physical forms\nof sexual harassment (e.g., touched, grabbed, or pinched in a sexual way; intentionally brushed up against in a sexual way)\nthan males (American Association of University Women Educational Foundation, 2001; Ontario Secondary School Teacher\nFederation, 1995).\nDespite research that suggests biological sex is influential in understanding sexual harassment, there is a noted paucity\nof research exploring the experiences of youth across gender identities and among youth who identify as transgender in\nparticular. Gender identity, including transgender, is different than sexual orientation: It is the knowledge of oneself as being\nmale or female. Transgender youth feel themselves to be of a gender different from their biological sex, which is separate\nfrom one\xe2\x80\x99s sexual orientation (i.e., gay, lesbian, heterosexual, or bisexual). Although data are lacking for sexual harassment\nspecifically, research on other forms of victimization support the hypothesis that transgender youth may be at heightened\nrisk. For example, compared to male and female gender LGB youth, transgender youth are even more likely to be physically\nharassed and assaulted (Greytak, Kosciw, Diaz, & Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network, 2009; Grossman & D\xe2\x80\x99Augelli,\n2006; Kosciw, Greytak, Bartkiewicz, Boesen, & Palmer, 2012; McGuire, Anderson, Toomey, & Russell, 2010). Ninety percent\nof transgender students heard derogatory remarks, such as \xe2\x80\x9cdyke\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cfaggot\xe2\x80\x9d in school at least sometimes during the past\nyear; 90% heard negative remarks about someone\xe2\x80\x99s gender expression (Greytak et al., 2009). More than half of transgender\nyouth have been physically harassed and more than one-quarter physically assaulted because of their gender expression or\nsexual orientation (Greytak et al., 2009). Illustrating how these data relate to sexual harassment more specifically among\nthis population needs to be a priority for adolescent health research.\nThe Impact of Sexual Harassment\nLittle is known about how sexual harassment may affect one\xe2\x80\x99s daily life, particularly for LGBT youth. Data from college\nstudents suggests that LGBT young people aremore deeply affected by the experience (Hill & Silva, 2005). Theymay feel angry,\nafraid, less confident, or more self-conscious and be dissatisfied with their college experience. Adolescent health research\nabout other types of peer victimization suggest that LGBT youth report greater disruptions in educational trajectories as a\nresult of their experiences (Collier, van Beusekom, Bos, & Sandfort, 2013). We need to better understand how many young\npeople experience disruptions in their daily functioning, including relationships with family and friends, and the ability\nto continue to feel able to navigate the world safely. Identifying factors \xe2\x80\x93 both risk (e.g., depressive symptomatology) and\nprotective (e.g., self-esteem) \xe2\x80\x93 that help explain one\xe2\x80\x99s vulnerability to this interference also is critical.\n282 K.J. Mitchell et al. / Child Abuse & Neglect 38 (2014) 280\xe2\x80\x93295\nUnderstanding Protective Factors for Sexual Harassment\nSupportive and accepting individuals in a LGBT adolescent\xe2\x80\x99s life can play a protective role reducing harmful effects of\nvictimization and other risk factors (Anhalt & Morris, 1998). Evidence has emerged that suggests protective factors, such as\nfamily connectedness and supportive adults, are not only associated with lower levels of risk for mental health problems and\nsuicidal ideation but also mitigate the negative relationships between victimization and risk (Eisenberg & Resnick, 2006).\nNot all LGBT youth have access to social support, however. Less than half (45.7%) of LGBT youth report that they have a\nstudent club in their school that addresses LGBT student issues. And youth who attended a high school with a gay-straight\nalliance (GSA) had less alcohol use, less depression symptoms, and less generalized psychological distress compared with\nyouth without a GSA in their high school (Heck, Flentje, & Cochran, 2011). Sexual minority adolescents have more difficulties\nin getting along with peers, teachers, and parents (Ueno, 2005). Among a community-based high school sample of LGBQ\nadolescents, sexual minority youth reported less social support from both peers and family members than their heterosexual\ncounterparts (Williams et al., 2005). This study also found that more social support was related to less victimization (i.e.,\nbullying, sexual harassment, and physical abuse by peers) and less externalizing and depressive symptoms.\nSelf-esteem is also critical for the well-being of LGBT youth. Research suggests that for LGBT youth, school victimization\nwas related to lower self-esteem (Russell, Ryan, Toomey, Diaz, & Sanchez, 2011). Further, students who experience higher\nlevels of victimization (i.e., harassment, assault in school) based on their sexual orientation or gender expression have lower\nlevels of self-esteem than those who report lower levels of the same types of victimization (Kosciw et al., 2012). Findings\nfrom the current study will add an important piece to the existing literature on the potential protective influences of social\nsupport and self-esteem for buffering the impact of sexual harassment among all youth, and LGBT youth in particular.\nAdditional Factors Missing from the Literature\nTechnology is now an integral part of the lives of adolescents. Use of the Internet by teens between the ages of 12 and 17\nin the United States has increased from 73% in 2000 to 95% in 2012 (Pew Internet & American Life Project, 2013). Moreover,\nin 2012, 74% of teens had mobile access to the Internet and 25% accessed the Internet mostly from their cell phone. Even with\nthis widespread use of the Internet among youth, little is known about how youth experience sexual harassment through\ntechnology. The limited data that does exist suggests a substantial percentage of youth (about 1 in 6) in the United States\nreport unwanted sexual experiences (i.e., someone trying to get me to talk about sex when I did not want to; someone\nasked me to do something sexual when I did not want to) via the Internet in a given year (Ybarra, Mitchell, & Espelage,\n2012; Ybarra et al., 2011). Whether sexual minority youth experience sexual harassment through technology differently\nfrom heterosexual youth has yet to be explored.\nIntimate and sexual relationships are normative, age-typical tasks for adolescents and these relationships have signifi-\ncant implications for health, adjustment, and psychosocial functioning (Bouchey & Furman, 2003; Collins, 2003). A healthy\nromantic relationship is related to a positive self-concept (Connolly & Konarski, 1994) and the development of important\ninterpersonal skills such as sharing, negotiation, disclosure, and intimacy (Feiring, 1996; Furman & Shaffer, 2003). Given\nhow central dating and sexual behavior is in the lives of adolescents, and the inherent sexual nature of the harassment\nexperiences under study, it is important to take into account adolescent\xe2\x80\x99s dating and sexual experiences when exploring\nfactors related to sexual harassment.\nHypotheses\nTo address these identified gaps in the literature, we will examine differences in sexual harassment rates and impact (i.e.,\ndistressing vs. non-distressing) by mode of harassment (e.g., online, in person), type of harassment (e.g., made obscene or\nsexual comments), youth behavior (e.g., dating and sexual activity), and protective factors (e.g., social support, self-esteem).\nWe also examine how these rates are similar and different across sexual orientation and gender identity groups. Based upon\nschool and adult data, we posit that LGBT youth will report higher rates of sexual harassment across modes; and that the\nimpact will be more severe among these youth.\nMethod\nParticipants\nTeen Health and Technology (THT) survey data were collected from August 4, 2010, to January 17, 2011, from 5,907\n13 to 18 year-olds in the United States. The survey protocol was reviewed and approved by the Chesapeake Institutional\nReview Board (IRB), the University of New Hampshire IRB, and the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network (GLSEN)\nIRB. We received a waiver of parental consent to protect youth who would be potentially placed in harm\xe2\x80\x99s way if their sexual\norientation was unintentionally disclosed to their caregivers.\nSample size challenges because of low base rates of LGBT youth (Kann et al., 2011) make it difficult to randomly select\na national, representative sample of children and adolescents 18 years of age and younger which is large enough to draw\nstatistically valid conclusions. For example, a population-based study of adolescents, 13 to 18 years old (Harris Interactive &\nK.J. Mitchell et al. / Child Abuse & Neglect 38 (2014) 280\xe2\x80\x93295 283\nGay, Lesbian, & Straight Education Network [GLSEN], 2005), has shown that about 5% of this population identify as lesbian,\ngay, or bisexual. The THT study was designed particularly to address this limitation. Participants were recruited from two\nsources: (a) the Harris Poll Online (HPOL) opt-in panel (n = 3,989 respondents) and (b) referrals from GLSEN (n = 1,918\nrespondents).\nThe HPOL and GLSEN samples differed in some expected ways, even after taking into account weighting. The HPOL\nsample was significantly more likely to be heterosexual (75% vs. <1%), younger (45% were ages 13\xe2\x80\x9315 compared to 39% of\nthe GLSEN sample), White race (68% vs. 63%), and live in a small town or rural area (40% vs. 33%). GLSEN participants were\nmore likely to be of Hispanic ethnicity (23% vs. 19%) and female gender (61% vs. 52%). We see age differences in ways we\nwould expect because of typical sexual development whereby one becomes increasingly aware of one\xe2\x80\x99s sexual self, including\nsexual orientation, with age. The differences in ethnicity and race were not clinically significant but statistically significant\nbecause of the large sample size. The noted differences in type of community were expected given the stigma associated\nwith being a sexual minority, particularly in smaller communities.\nProcedures\nThe survey was self-administered to all participants online. Qualified respondents were defined as (a) U.S. residents, (b)\nages 13 to 18, (c) in 5th grade or above, and (d) assented or consented to participate in the survey. The median survey length\nwas 23 min for HPOL respondents and 34 min for GLSEN respondents.\nHPOL respondents were invited through password-protected email invitations to participate in a survey about their\nonline experiences. A stratified random sample of U.S. residents was identified among four groups of HPOL members: (a) 13\nto 18 year-olds, (b) adults with a 13 to 17 year-old in their household, (c) adults with a child under 18 in their household,\nand (d) a general population of adults. Invitations to HPOL adults noted that the survey was intended for a 13 to 18 year old\nin the household and asked the adult to forward the survey link to the teen.\nAn oversample of LGBT teenagers was recruited into the study through GLSEN\xe2\x80\x99s referral efforts. GLSEN is the leading\nnational education organization focusing on ensuring safe schools for all youth, regardless of sexual orientation or gender\nidentity (www.glsen.org). GLSEN works to educate teachers, students, and the public about the negative impact of homophobia\nand heterosexism on a healthy school environment for youth. Most GLSEN referral respondents were recruited through:\n(a) emails sent with the survey link to GLSEN\xe2\x80\x99s distribution list and (b) publicizing the survey through targeted advertising\non Facebook.\nThe response rate for the HPOL sample was calculated as the number of individuals who started the survey divided by\nthe number of email invitations sent less any email invitations that were returned as undeliverable. The survey response\nrate, 7.2%, is within range of other recent national Random Digit Dialing (RDD) telephone surveys (Lenhart, Purcell, Smith, &\nZickuhr, 2010; Mitchell, Jones, & Wolak, 2011), even though the response rates of telephone surveys typically appear higher\nthan online response rates because it is impossible for online surveys to determine if the email has reached the intended\nrecipient\xe2\x80\x99s inbox (as opposed to being filtered out by spam filters), and individuals who have not \xe2\x80\x9cpicked up\xe2\x80\x9d their email.\nThe response rate for the GLSEN sample cannot be calculated as the denominator is indeterminable.\nWeighting procedures were used so that the data would behave as if they were nationally representative and to align\nthe two samples so that they could be combined into one dataset. Propensity weighting is a well-established statistical\ntechnique that, when applied to data, minimizes the issue of nonrandomness based on known covariates and establishes\nequivalency for those who are in the sample versus not because of self-selection bias (Rosenbaum & Rubin, 1984; Schonlau\net al., 2004; Terhanian & Bremer, 2000). HPOL data are consistently comparable to data that have been obtained from\nrandom telephone samples of the general populations once propensity weighting and appropriate sample weights are\napplied (Berrens, Bohara, Jenkins-Smith, Silva, & Weimer, 2003; Berrens, Bohara, Jenkins-Smith, Silva, & Weimer, 2004;\nSchonlau et al., 2004; Terhanian, Siegel, Overmeyer, Bremer, & Taylor, 2001). (See Ybarra, Mitchell, Kosciw, Korchamaros, &\nDiener-West, submitted for publication for more details about propensity score weighting in this study.)\nMeasures\nSexual orientation. Sexual orientation was measured with the following question: \xe2\x80\x9cBelow is a list of terms that people\noften use to describe their sexuality or sexual orientation. How would you describe your sexuality or sexual orientation?\nPlease select all that apply.\xe2\x80\x9d Response options included: Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Straight/heterosexual, Questioning, Queer, Other,\nor Not Sure.\nBecause youth were allowed to endorse multiple options, mutually exclusive categories were created at the data cleaning\nstage so that analyses could compare youth across sexual orientation categories. Responses were categorized based upon\nthe following hierarchy: Gay/Lesbian, Bisexual, Queer, Questioning, and Straight/Heterosexual. Thus, as an example, if an\nindividual identified as gay and queer, they were categorized as Gay/Lesbian; if an individual identified as bisexual and\nquestioning, they were categorized as Bisexual.\nGender identity. Gender identity was measured with the following question: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your gender? Your gender is how\nyou feel inside and can be the same or different than the answer you gave [when you were asked about your biological sex].\xe2\x80\x9d\nResponse options were male, female, transgender, or other (specify). Multiple response options were possible.\n284 K.J. Mitchell et al. / Child Abuse & Neglect 38 (2014) 280\xe2\x80\x93295\nFor the purposes of the current paper, we looked at a combination of sexual orientation-gender identities among youth\nwith the same biological sex and gender identities (termed cisgender) and gender identity separately. To examine sexual\norientation-gender identity we classified youth into eight groups: (a) Heterosexual boys, (b) Heterosexual girls, (c) Bisexual\nboys, (d) Bisexual girls, (e) Questioning boys, (f) Questioning girls, (g) Gay/queer boys, and (h) Lesbian/queer girls. The\nanalytic sample for analyses based on sexual orientation-gender identity was 5,139 as it was restricted to cisgender youth.\nThere was insufficient sample size to allow for categorization of transgender youth by sexual orientation. Therefore, in a\nseparate analysis, we focused on gender identity; youth were classified into four groups: (a) Cisgender males, (b) Cisgender\nfemales, (c) Transgender, and (d) Gender non-conforming or other gender. The analytic sample for analyses based on gender\nidentity was 5,498.\nSexual harassment. We measured sexual harassment in two separate ways: mode and type. To measure sexual harassment\nby mode, youth were presented with the following text: \xe2\x80\x9cNext we have a few questions about sexual harassment.\nWe say that sexual harassment includes: unwanted sexual advances, unwanted requests for sexual favors, someone saying\nsomething or doing something sexual when you do not want them to. Sexual harassment can happen anywhere, like at\nschool, at home, or other places you hang out. In the past 12 months, how often have you been sexually harassed...? (a)\nIn-person, (b) By phone call (on a cell phone or landline), (c) By text message, (d) Online, and (e) Some other way.\xe2\x80\x9d Response\noptions were every day or almost every day, once or a few times a week, once or a few times a month, once of a few time in\nthe past 12 months, never in the past 12 months. A positive response to any of the above modes was indicative of any sexual\nharassment in the past year by mode.\nTo measure sexual harassment by type youth were asked: \xe2\x80\x9cIn the past 12 months, how often have you been sexually\nharassed in the following ways? Remember that these things can happen anywhere, including in-person, online, and by text\nmessaging. Nine different types of sexual harassment were provided: (a) Someone spread sexual rumors or wrote sexual\nmessages about me in a public place such as the bathroom walls, in locker rooms, etc.; (b) Someone touched, grabbed, or\npinched me or grabbed my clothing in a sexual way when I did not want them to; (c) Someone intentionally brushed up\nagainst me in a sexual way when I did not want them to; (d) Someone blocked my way or cornered me in a sexual way\nwhen I did not want them to; (e) Someone made sexual or obscene comments that I did not want to hear; (f) Someone\nshowed or sent me sexual or obscene messages or pictures when I did not want to see them; (g) Someone asked me for\nsexual information about myself when I did not want to tell them (really personal questions, like sexual things I have done\nor what my body looks like); (h) Someone asked me to do something sexual when I did not want to; and (i) I was sexually\nharassed in some other way.\xe2\x80\x9d Response options were the same as those provided by sexual harassment by mode. A positive\nresponse to any of the nine items was indicative of any sexual harassment in the past year by type.\nTaken together, a positive response to any mode or type was coded as experiencing sexual harassment in the past 12\nmonths.\nDistress. Youth who reported at least one sexual harassment episode by either mode or type were asked a series of\nfollow-up questions to determine the impact of the experience. We did not query distress for each mode or type to reduce\nrespondent burden. First, youth were asked, \xe2\x80\x9cThink about the places where you were sexually harassed in the past 12 months,\ndo any of these places now feel scary, unfriendly, or uncomfortable?\xe2\x80\x9d Response options were yes/no. Next, youth were asked\nhow much being sexually harassed interfered with (a) Your (school) work or other responsibilities, (b) Your relationships\nwith friends, and (c) Your relationships with family members. Response options were: Not at all, Not very much, Somewhat,\nand A lot. Responses were coded as a lot/somewhat versus other. We then asked youth to \xe2\x80\x9cThink about the time you were\nsexually harassed that you remember the most. How did you feel when it happened?\xe2\x80\x9d Response options were measured on\na 5-point scale ranging from not at all upset to extremely upset; and coded as very/extremely upset versus all other responses.\nDemographic characteristics. Age was coded as 13 to 15 years, 16 to 17 years, and 18 years old because of high collinearity\nwith some of the psychosocial characteristics and sexual activities. Household income was measured: \xe2\x80\x9cHow would you\ndescribe your family\xe2\x80\x99s income?\xe2\x80\x9d Youth had three options: Lower than average, About average, and Higher than average. Those\nwho indicated their income was lower than average were compared to all other youth. Region was measured by asking\nwhere the respondent\xe2\x80\x99s school was located: In an urban or city area, In a suburban area next to a city, or In a small town or\nrural area. Youth reported their race (coded as White vs. other) and ethnicity (coded as Hispanic vs. other).\nAdditional covariates. To measure dating, youth were asked how many romantic relationships they had in the past 12\nmonths with someone they would call a boyfriend or a girlfriend. To measure sexual activity, youth were first asked whether\nthey had ever had consensual oral sex (\xe2\x80\x9cHave you ever had oral sex [we mean stimulating the vagina or penis with the mouth\nor tongue] when you wanted to?\xe2\x80\x9d), penetrative sex (\xe2\x80\x9cHave you ever had sex with another person that involved a finger or\nsex toy going into the vagina or anus when you wanted to?\xe2\x80\x9d), vaginal sex (\xe2\x80\x9cHave you ever, when you wanted to, had sex\nwhere a penis went into a vagina?\xe2\x80\x9d), and anal sex (\xe2\x80\x9cHave you ever, when you wanted to had sex where someone\xe2\x80\x99s penis\nwent into your anus?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cHave you ever, when you wanted to had sex where your penis when into someone\xe2\x80\x99s anus?\xe2\x80\x9d). All\nyouth who had oral, vaginal, or anal sex in the past 12 months were then asked, \xe2\x80\x9cHow many people have you had any type\nof sex with in the past 12 months when you wanted to? By sex we mean oral sex or sex where a penis, finger, or sex toy goes\ninto the vagina or anus.\xe2\x80\x9d Number of romantic relationships and sex partners were each coded as none, one, or two or more.\nIndication of depressive symptomatology was measured with a sum variable of the 10 items from the Center for Epidemiologic\nStudies Depression Scale \xe2\x80\x93 Revised (CESD-R; \xcb\x9b= .93). This scale asks respondents to report how often they have felt,\ne.g., like a bad person. Response options included not at all or less than 1 day in the last week; 1\xe2\x80\x932 days in the last week; 3\xe2\x80\x934\ndays in the last week; 5\xe2\x80\x937 days in the last week; and nearly every day in the last week. Respondents were coded to reflect having\nK.J. Mitchell et al. / Child Abuse & Neglect 38 (2014) 280\xe2\x80\x93295 285\nmajor depression (i.e., five or more symptoms all day, nearly every day for the past two weeks, one of which is anhedonia\nor dysphoria; and functional impairment at home, with friends, or at school (1) versus not having major depression (0).\nTwo aspects of the parent\xe2\x80\x93child relationship were queried: Emotional bond (e.g., how well do you get along?; 3 items:\n\xcb\x9b= .75) and Coercive discipline (e.g., how often does your caregiver spank or slap you; 3 items: \xcb\x9b= .56). These two subscales\nwere modified from the Youth Internet Safety Survey (Ybarra, Mitchell, Wolak, & Finkelhor, 2006). Each aspect was reflected\nby a sum score of youth responses to the subscale items for the corresponding subscale, with a higher score reflecting a\nworse relationship. For both variables, the continuous variables were highly collinear with other psychosocial variables in\nthe model. As such, they were dichotomized to reflect scores one standard deviation above the mean and higher versus all\nother scores.\nSocial support was measured as a summation of four items from the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support\n(\xcb\x9b= .94; Zimet, Dahlem, Zimet, & Farley, 1988). These items asked respondents to think about their friends who they first\nmet in-person, not online, and to report how much they agree (very strongly disagree to very strongly agree) that they can\ntalk about their problems with these friends, can share their happy and sad moments with these friends, can count on these\nfriends when things go wrong, and these friends really try to help them. Responses across items were summed so that larger\nvalues reflect greater support from offline friends and then coded to reflect scores two standard deviations above the mean\nand higher (1) versus all other scores (0). Self-esteem was measured using the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (1965); \xcb\x9b= .93.\nThis scale asks respondents to report how much they agree or disagree that, e.g., I certainly feel useless at times. Response\noptions ranged from strongly disagree to strongly agree. Responses were coded so that larger values reflected greater selfesteem,\nwere summed across items, and then coded to reflect scores one standard deviation above the mean and higher (1)\nversus all other scores (0).\nData Analyses\nUsing Stata/SE 11.2 (StataCorp, 2009), data were imputed usingmultiple imputation. Respondents who gave valid answers\n(i.e., not do not know answers) for less than 80% of the survey or those who did not meet valid data requirements (i.e., survey\nlength was less than 5 min; self-reported age at the beginning and end of the survey differed by more than a year) were\ndropped. The final sample size was 5,542.\nFirst, we examined how many youth reported sexual harassment victimization by sexual orientation-gender identity and\nthen by gender identity. We also estimated how many youth reported sexual harassment victimization by specific modes\n(e.g., in-person, online) and types for youth of different sexual orientations and gender identities. Next, we explored how\noften and in what ways sexual harassment resulted in distress, both by sexual orientation and gender identity. We used chisquare\ntests, corrected for survey weights (i.e., Design-based F statistics), to measure statistical differences between youth\nof different sexual orientation and gender identity groups. Two multinomial logistic regressions were used to estimate the\nodds of non-distressing and distressing sexual harassment (with no sexual harassment as a reference group) given a number\nof risk and protective factors suggested in the literature. All independent variables were entered at the same time into the\nmodels. We first focused on differences across sexual orientation-gender identity groups, and then focused on differences\nacross gender identity groups. Conditional odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals are reported for each. The models were\nadjusted for survey process measures: Self-reported honesty in answering survey questions, and completion of the survey\nalone or with other people in the room irrespective of statistical significance.\nResults\nRates and Impact of Sexual Harassment by Sexual Orientation-Gender Identity\nRates of past year sexual harassment varied significantly when examined by sexual orientation (Table 1). Lesbian/queer\ngirls reported the highest rates of past year sexual harassment (72%) across mode and type, followed by bisexual girls (66%)\nand gay/queer boys (66%). Heterosexual boys reported the lowest rate (23%). Information about individual modes and types\nof sexual harassment is detailed in Table 1. Across all sexual orientation groups, youth most commonly reported being\nsexually harassed in-person and online; they most frequently reported experiencing harassment in the form of obscene or\nsexual comments and being asked for sexual information. Overall rates of sexual harassment were higher when queried by\ntype rather than mode.\nYouth were impacted differently by the sexual harassment experiences. Distress included being very or extremely upset\nbecause of the harassment; interference with school work or other responsibilities, relationships with friends, and relationships\nwith family; and feeling like the harassment resulted in a hostile environment (places felt scary, unfriendly or\nuncomfortable). Over half (54%) of lesbian/queer girls and bisexual girls (52%) reported some type of sexual harassmentrelated\ndistress (Table 1). Heterosexual boys reported the least distress (33%). As shown in Table 2, all sexual orientation\ngroups were more likely to experience any sexual harassment and distressing sexual harassment in comparison to heterosexual\nboys. Gay/queer boys, lesbian/queer girls, and bisexual girls were particularly likely to report elevated rates.\n286 K.J.

Transgender\nyouth reported the highest rates of sexual harassment (81%), followed by gender non-conforming/other gender youth\n(69%). About half (52%) of youth identifying as female reported sexual harassment as did 34% of youth identifying as male.\nThese patterns held for sexual harassment by mode (e.g., online, in person) and by type (e.g., obscene or sexual comments,\nasked to do something sexual).\nMale youth reported significantly less distress than all other groups (37%). The other groups reported distress between 47%\n(female youth) and 65% (gender non-conforming youth). All groups of youth reported elevated odds of distressing and nondistressing\nsexual harassment in comparison to male gendered youth (see Table 2). Compared to male youth, the elevated\nodds of harassment-related distress were highest for youth who identified both as transgender and gender non-conforming\n(see Table 2).\nOther Characteristics Related to Sexual Harassment Victimization\nAs shown in Table 4, risk factors bivariately related to increased odds of both distressing and non-distressing sexual\nharassment included: Having at least one romantic partner in the past 12 months, at least one sex partner in the past\n12 months, high depressive symptomatology, high caregiver coercive behavior, and a poor emotional bond with one\xe2\x80\x99s\ncaregiver. High self-esteem was protective against distressing and non-distressing sexual harassment; high social support\nwas protective against distressing harassment. Lower than average income and Hispanic ethnicity were positively related\nto distressing harassment.

Other\nyouth characteristics related to increased odds of distressing sexual harassment included having one or two or more romantic\npartners, one or two or more sex partners, high depressive symptomatology, and experiencing high coercive discipline from\nparents. Protective factors were also noted: Youth with high social support were less likely to report distressing sexual\nharassment, as were youth with high self-esteem. Findings for youth reports of non-distressing sexual harassment followed\nsimilar patterns, but conditional odds ratios were attenuated.\nLikelihood of Distressing and Non-Distressing Sexual Harassment by Gender Identity\nYouth identifying as female gender were 2.3 times more likely (95% CI [1.8, 2.9]) than male youth to report distressing\nsexual harassment (Table 6). Transgender and gender non-conforming youth had an even higher likelihood of distressing\nsexual harassment in comparison to male youth (COR = 6.5, COR = 5.6, respectively). All other factors were consistent with\nthose identified in the previous model. Factors related to non-distressing sexual harassment were attenuated but consistent\nwith those related to distressing harassment.\n290 K.J.

Consistent with previous literature (Greytak et al.,\n2009; Gruber & Fineran, 2008; Human Rights Campaign, 2012; Kosciw & Diaz, 2006; Williams et al., 2003), LGBT youth in the\ncurrent study reported victimization rates higher than their non-LGBT peers. Both sexual orientation and gender identity\nseem to be key factors in understanding risk for sexual harassment in adolescence. Findings add to the existing literature by\nidentifying differences across specific sexual minority groups and providing much-needed information about under-studied\ntransgender youth.\nThe Unique Experience of the Female Gender\nMost of the research that compares males and females in terms of their rates of sexual harassment are looking at biological\nsex and indeed, biological sex does matter. That girls report more sexual harassment than boys has been previously noted\nin large-scale, national studies in the United States (e.g., Finkelhor et al., 2013). Girls also experience sexual harassment\ndifferently than boys, as they experience more unwanted comments, gestures, and touch (Chiodo, Wolfe, Crooks, Hughes,\n& Jaffe, 2009b). Adolescent girls also consistently report more discomfort and negative consequences as a result of sexual\nharassment than boys (Lee, Croninger, Linn, & Chen, 1996). The immediate and long-term outcomes associated with sexual\nharassment are also often stronger and more negative for girls (Chiodo et al., 2009b).\nFindings from this study add to this existing literature in several ways. First, we specifically explored rates of sexual\nharassment by gender identity (i.e., the knowledge of oneself as being male or female). Transgender youth feel themselves\nto be of a gender different from their biological sex, and cisgender youth feel themselves to be of a gender that is the same as\ntheir biological sex. Second, our findings confirmed that this pattern of increased rates of sexual harassment for the female\nsex extends to all youth of the female gender, regardless of sexual orientation: Female heterosexual youth reported higher\nK.J. Mitchell et al. / Child Abuse & Neglect 38 (2014) 280\xe2\x80\x93295 291\nrates of sexual harassment and more distress than heterosexual males, bisexual girls more than bisexual boys, and lesbian\nyouth more than gay youth. Of particular interest, given our focus on sexual minority youth, is the motivational differences\nbehind same-sex versus opposite-sex sexual harassment (McMaster et al., 2002). For heterosexual youth, most oppositesex\nharassment is partly motivated by sexual interest, whereas same-sex harassment is more likely to be motivated by\naggression.\nOur data is limited in that we do not know the sex or motivation of the individuals behind the sexual harassment. Such\nknowledge is a critical next step in better understanding the differential experience of sexual harassment among LGBT youth\nand could play an important role in both primary and secondary prevention of sexual harassment for all youth.\nImpact of Sexual Harassment\nIn many cases, youth who were sexually harassed did not report a significant impact in their ability to continue to function\nin their daily lives as a result. For a notable number of youth, particularly sexual minority youth, however, the experience\naffected their relationships with their friends and family and their school work. The harassment also made certain places\nfeel scary or uncomfortable. Given the disproportionate victimization experienced overall by LGBT youth, perhaps they are\nmore vulnerable to distress for a number of reasons. First, it could be that the impact of victimization compounds already\nexisting stress due to stigma associated with being a sexual minority. The literature certainly documents elevated levels\nof emotional distress for LGBT youth, including depressive symptomatology, suicidal ideation, and self-harm compared to\ntheir heterosexual peers (Almeida, Johnson, Corliss, Molnar, & Azrael, 2009; Robinson & Espelage, 2011, 2012). Such distress\nis suggested to be a byproduct of the stigmatization associated with being a sexual minority in society (Martin-Storey &\nCrosnoe, 2012). More research is necessary.\nSecond, victimized LGBT youth tend to come out earlier and be more visible (D\xe2\x80\x99Augelli, Pilkington, & Hershberger, 2002)\nand may be more gender-atypical (D\xe2\x80\x99Augelli, Grossman, & Starks, 2006; D\xe2\x80\x99Augelli et al., 2002). In the current study, bisexual\ngirls, lesbian/queer girls, and gay/queer boys reported particularly elevated odds of both distressing and non-distressing\nsexual harassment; the same is true for gender non-conforming and transgender youth. Thus, \xe2\x80\x9cqueerer\xe2\x80\x9d youth appear to\nbe more likely sexually harassed than others. Some adolescents may have a degree of social uneasiness with what they\nperceive to be others\xe2\x80\x99 sexual ambiguity, whether it be gender identity or sexuality or a combination of the two, and this\nin turn becomes the impetus for the harassment. It amplifies the implicit message: You are different and it is because of\nyour sexuality. It may be too that one\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to the victimization is affected by one\xe2\x80\x99s stage of coming out or degree of\nself-acceptance: Those who are less assured or confident may be worried that the harassment will in some way \xe2\x80\x98out\xe2\x80\x99 them.\nPrevious research has suggested that these youth are more concerned about the way they will be received by peers and family\nwhen they disclose the experience (Carragher & Rivers, 2002; Ryan & Rivers, 2003). Studying the timing of sexual harassment\nvictimization in relation to these critical life events for LGBT youth is an important next step in our understanding of the\nimpact of victimization for this population. More generally, LGBT youth may personalize the victimization and attribute its\ncause to their sexual orientation, a core part of their self, whereas heterosexual and cisgender youth may attribute the cause\nto something external and less linked to their self and therefore feel victimization is easier to avoid in the future.\nA third reason LGBT youth may be particularly likely to experience distress because of the sexual harassment may be\nbecause LGBT youth are often subject to more intense victimization experiences (e.g., more targeted, more intrusive, more\nsevere; Dunbar, 2006). Examination of the specific details of the victimization incident itself would help determine this.\nResearch about youth experiences with other types of victimization supports this notion: Incident characteristics such as\nbeing targeted by adults, being asked to send a picture of oneself, and attempts at offline contact were all related to increased\nlikelihood of distress among youth who were harassed online in a national survey (Ybarra et al., 2006).\nFinally, fear could play a role in the elevated levels of distress as a result of sexual harassment for LGBT youth. Sexual\nminority youth report high rates of feeling unsafe at school: 64% of LGBT youth felt unsafe because of their sexual orientation\nand 44% because of their gender expression in the 2011 School Climate Survey (Kosciw et al., 2012). LGB youth are significantly\nmore likely than non-LGB youth to report being threatened with a weapon (DuRant, Krowchuk, & Sinal, 1998; Garafalo, Wolf,\nKessel, Palfrey, & DuRant, 1998), being involved in fights at school (DuRant et al., 1998), and have their property damaged\nwhile at school (Garafalo et al., 1998). Accordingly, LGB youth are significantly more likely than non-LGB youth to report\nmissing school because they feel unsafe (Coalition for Education on Sexual Orientation, 2005; Garafalo et al., 1998). As a\nresult, LGBT youth may react differently and more intensely to any form of victimization which could add to these elevated\nfeelings of being unsafe. Our findings suggest that LGBT youth, and bisexual girls, gay/queer boys, and lesbian/queer girls\nin particular, reported that places \xe2\x80\x9cfeel scary, unfriendly or uncomfortable\xe2\x80\x9d as a response to the sexual harassment they\nexperienced. Even larger numbers of transgender and gender non-conforming youth reported this to be the case. Findings\nsuggest the importance of ensuring safety for all youth, and LGBT youth in particular. Having teachers and other school\npersonnel who are openly supportive of LGBT students is an important first step in helping to alleviate such fear, both in\nterms of support for the LGBT student themselves and as role models for non-LGBT students. Teachers also need to intervene\nand stop instances of sexual harassment. Indeed, research examining school climate for transgender youth found that when\nschools took action to reduce harassment, students reported greater connections with school staff which were, in turn,\nassociated with greater feelings of safety (McGuire et al., 2010).\n292 K.J. Mitchell et al. / Child Abuse & Neglect 38 (2014) 280\xe2\x80\x93295\nOther Factors Related to Distress\nGiven the potential for the victimization to have a lasting impact on youth development, it is critical to understand concurrent\ninfluential factors contributing to an increased likelihood of victimization-related distress. Beyond sexual orientation\nand gender identity, additional factors associated with distressing sexual harassment victimization emerged. Youth with\nhigh depressive symptomatology were more than 2 times as likely to also report a distressing sexual harassment experience.\nIt may be that depressed youth are more likely to become distressed as a result of the sexual harassment; it may also be that\nyouth who are depressed are more likely to be sexually harassed because of some perceived or real vulnerability. Depression\ncould also be the outcome of distressing (and perhaps objectively more traumatic) sexual harassment. All scenarios likely\nhave a reality depending on the youth and the situation, although there is some support for sexual harassment to predict\nlower self-esteem and symptoms of depression for females in 8th grade, three years later (Goldstein, Malanchuk, Davis-Kean,\n& Eccles, 2007).\nSexual activity and romantic involvement were both associated with increased likelihood of concurrently reporting sexual\nharassment generally, and distressing harassment specifically. Perhaps these youth are engaging in activities through which\nthey are exploring their sexuality, and unexpectedly find themselves in sexualized situations that they did not want. More\nresearch is needed about how sexual harassment may fit into the potential continuum of healthy relationships.\nProtective Factors Related to Reduced Likelihood of Distress\nIn line with previous research (Kosciw et al., 2012; Russell et al., 2011; Williams et al., 2005), protective factors also were\nsuggested: For all youth, LGBT and non-LGBT, high self-esteem was significantly associated with lower odds of reporting a\ndistressing sexual harassment experience in the past year. This supports other literature suggesting self-esteem is critical for\nthe well-being of LGBT youth. For example, students who experience higher levels of victimization (i.e., harassment, assault\nin school) based on their sexual orientation or gender expression have lower levels of self-esteem than those who report\nlower levels of the same types of victimization (Kosciw et al., 2012). We also found youth with high levels of social support\nwere less likely to be distressed. LGBT youth may be particularly at a disadvantage because they often have less social support\nand fewer resources to help them cope with the victimization experience (Almeida et al., 2009). Among a community-based\nhigh school sample of LGBQ adolescents, sexual minority youth reported less social support from both peers and family\nmembers than their heterosexual counterparts (Williams et al., 2005). Less than half (45.7%) of LGBT youth report that they\nhave a student club in their school that addresses LGBT student issues. Youth with more internal and external resources\nappear to fare better when sexually harassed. It is also possible that people with high levels of social support or self-esteem\nare protected from sexual harassment in the first place. Regardless of the directionality of the relationships which requires\nfurther study, expanding the support network of LGBT youth, such as through online sources, may help bridge this gap in\nsupport. Indeed, compared to heterosexual youth, LGB youth are more likely to say that their friendships online are better\nthan their in person friendships. This finding suggests that for some youth, the Internet can be a source of social support\n(Ybarra, Palmer, Mitchell, & Reisner, in preparation).\nIs the Internet a \xe2\x80\x9cSafer\xe2\x80\x9d Place for LGBT Teens?\nThe Internet does not appear to provide a level playing ground or a place where LGBT youth can necessarily be buffered\nfrom the risk of sexual harassment that otherwise occurs in person. Indeed, after in person, sexual harassment was most\ncommonly reported as occurring online; this was true for youth of all sexual orientations and gender identities. In most\ncases, rates of sexual harassment via text were about half as common as those occurring in person. Even as access to and\nuse of the Internet and text messaging continue to grow as a preferred communication between youth (Lenhart, 2012),\ntraditional victimization routes (i.e., in person) are by far more common. At the same time, technology is a means of sexual\nharassment for youth and LGBT youth in particular. We found LGBT youth and lesbian/bisexual girls in particular reported\nsexual harassment via the Internet. Text-messaging-based sexual harassment was also most commonly reported by these\ngroups of youth. Effective prevention efforts necessarily need to include online and text messaging-based scenarios but not\nto the exclusion of content that targets in person interactions.\nThe Sexualized Nature of Bullying/Aggression\nResearchers have begun to bridge the once distinct literature of sexual harassment and bullying (Espelage & Holt, 2007;\nMiller et al., 2013; Shute, Owens, & Slee, 2008). Commonalities exist based on the nature or content of the bullying. Indeed,\nresearch has found the bully victimization of girls by high school boys to be overwhelmingly sexual in nature (e.g., Shute\net al., 2008). Bullying and verbal harassment experienced by LGBT students in particular is often sexual in nature; and this\nis especially true for harassment experienced by transgender people and lesbian and bisexual young women (Bochenek &\nBrown, 2001). The majority of LGBT teens have been harassed specifically because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.\nIndeed, 82% were verbally harassed and 38% physically harassed because of their sexual orientation; 64% were verbally\nharassed, and 27% physically harassed because of their gender expression (Kosciw et al., 2012). Overlap in victimization\nexperience also is noted. Youth who are victims of bullying report the highest rates of peer sexual harassment victimization\nK.J. Mitchell et al. / Child Abuse & Neglect 38 (2014) 280\xe2\x80\x93295 293\n(Holt & Espelage, 2005; Ybarra et al., 2012). Further, bullying perpetration and homophobic teasing are significant predictors\nof sexual harassment perpetration over time (Espelage, Basile, & Hamburger, 2012). A limitation of the current data is\nthe focus exclusively on sexual harassment. Additional bullying experiences were not included because the survey did not\nallow for the disentanglement of sexualized and non-sexualized bullying. It is possible that higher rates of victimization and\nassociated impact would be noted if bullying also were included in the analyses.\nLimitations\nAdditional limitations that need to be considered include the fact that this is a cross-sectional study, thus, temporality\ncannot be determined. Whether social support buffered sexual harassment, or a positive response to sexual harassment\nincreased social support, for example, cannot be determined in the current data. Further, the data are national, but required\nweighting to behave as if they were nationally representative. Selection bias in the unweighted data may exist because youth\nin the HPOL sample were required to be affiliated with the HPOL and in the GLSEN sample because youth were recruited\nthrough GLSEN networks. Although we took a cautious approach and are confident in our analytic strategies, findings should\nbe replicated in other national studies.\nThe data were self-reported online. There is a possibility that youth reports were not accurate because of, for example,\nconscious or unconscious misreporting, or adults responding to the survey. Multiple procedures were used to encourage\nhonest and accurate reporting. For example, respondents were encouraged to complete the survey while alone in a safe\nplace and were ensured that their responses were confidential. Participants did not receive incentives for their participation,\nreducing the benefit of completing the survey multiple times. The eligibility criteria, particularly the age range, were not\npublicized so that potential respondents would know what the right answers would be to qualify for the survey. Thus, we\nare confident that the data accurately reflect the characteristics and experiences of the youth who participated in this study.\nFinally, a critical element to the understanding of sexual harassment among sexual minorities may be whether the\nperpetrator is same- or opposite-sex, which cannot be determined within the current data. A better understanding of the\ncharacteristics of the perpetrator would help us better understand the motives behind the harassment, including whether\nsexual orientation was a key factor.\nConclusion\nFindings add to the growing literature in the field of youth violence documenting increased risk for sexual harassment\namong LGBT youth. This is true both in person, as well as in technology-based communications such as the Internet and\ntext messaging. Professionals should focus on the more nuanced differences in sexual harassment experiences among the\ndiverse groups of sexual minority youth. Motivations behind sexual harassment during adolescence are likely evolving and\nneed to be a focus of scrutiny, particularly among the complex developmental experiences of LGBT youth. Findings point to\nthe great importance of sexual harassment prevention for all adolescents, with a particular emphasis on the unique needs\nand experiences of youth of different sexual orientations and gender identities. Socio-emotional programs that emphasize\nself-esteem building could be particular beneficial for reducing the likelihood of sexual harassment victimization as well as\nlessen the impact when it occurs.\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank the entire Study team from Internet Solutions for Kids, the University of New Hampshire, the\nGay Lesbian Heterosexual Education Network (GLSEN), Latrobe University, and Harris Interactive, who contributed to the\nplanning and implementation of the study.

aS'A SEARCH FOR THE ELUSIVE SETTING EVENTS OF SCHOOL VANDALISM: A\nCORRELATIONAL STUDY\n\n\n\n\n ABSTRACT\n This study was conducted in 28 intermediate schools to discover factors in the school environ-\n ment that are related to vandalism. Data were collected on vandalism and the school environ-\n ment. Vandalism cost and frequency were found to be greater in schools that had lower scores\n on a school discipline survey (p< .05). The results are discussed in terms of setting factors,\n punishment, and reinforcement.\n \xe2\x98\x85 \xe2\x98\x85 \xe2\x98\x85\n "Crime and violence threaten the viability of our public schools," said\n United States Attorney General William French Smith (Nicholson, 1981).\n Speaking during June, 1981, Smith called for a crackdown on violence and\n vandalism in the schools, stating that more than 250,000 students and 5,000\n teachers are physically assaulted in a typical month. In addition, the National\n School Resource Network and the California Safety Center (Nicholson, 1981)\n report that more than $600 million is spent annually on school property repair,\n security devices, insurance, and guards.\n Amidst a great public outcry to address the problems of violence and van-\n dalism, school districts have responded with so-called "hard" measures\n (Reaves, 1981). The Los Angeles Unified School District developed a security\n force of more than 325 agents and placed intrusion alarms in many schools.\n Other districts have developed means of identifying violence-prone youngsters\n This study was carried out with the assistance of a grant from the Office of the Los Angeles\n County Superintendent of Schools. The authors are grateful to Cindy Ismael and Cheng-Ou\n Chang for programming the data analysis. Reprints may be obtained from G.

For example, results from a survey\n by the American Association of School Administrators (Brodinsky, 1980)\n indicated that personnel in school districts spend more time and energy in\n implementing punitive measures than in positive or preventive measures.\n Similarly, teachers, on the average, have been observed to use disapproval\n approximately three times more frequently than approval when they respond\n to student behavior (Heller & White, 1975; Thomas, Presland, Grant, &\n Glynn, 1978; White, 1975).\n This reliance on heavy security arrangements and punitive discipline\n strategies may actually aggravate school-related violence and vandalism\n (Greenberg, 1969, 1974). Likewise, Mayer and Butterworth (1979, 1981) and\n Mayer, Butterworth, Nafpaktitis, and Sulzer-Azaroff (1983) have suggested\n that relying on punishment as a school-wide and classroom management pro-\n cedure is a condition in the school environment that can actually promote\n school disruption and vandalism. Findings from the experimental analysis\n of behavior have taught us that extinction and punishment tend to provoke\n aggression and destruction by laboratory animals (Azrin, Hutchinson, &\n Hake, 1963). Research with humans also provides "mounting evidence that\n aversive stimulation generates an instigation to aggression in our species as\n well as in lower orders" (Berkowitz, 1983, p. 1139). Even frustrations and\n failures to attain a desired goal "can produce aggressive inclinations because\n of their aversive nature" (Berkowitz, 1983, p. 1 143). It would seem reasonable\n to hypothesize, then, that some proportion of the aggression and destruc-\n tion that takes place in public schools is a reaction to aversive school\n environments.\n Mayer and his colleagues (1979, 1981, 1983) also suggest additional fac-\n tors that may contribute to the punitive nature of the school discipline en-\n vironment resulting in increased vandalism. These include vague rules, in-\n consistency, lack of appropriate follow-through, and little or no allowance\n made for individual differences. The last problem mentioned is exemplified\n by a lack of individualized consequences so that everyone receives the same\n punishment for the same infraction. Such misuse of behavior management\n procedures can result in an increase, rather than a decrease, of aggressive\n behavior (Mayer & Butterworth, 1979).\n Several investigators (Mayer & Butterworth, 1979; Mayer, Butterworth,\n Nafpaktitis, & Sulzer-Azaroff, 1983) have attempted to eliminate or reduce\n some of the hypothesized conditions or setting events that produce aggres-\n sion. By doing so, they were able to obtain significant reductions in vandalism.\nThis content downloaded from 128.95.104.66 on Thu, 20 Apr 2017 19:12:01 UTC\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\n SCHOOL VANDALISM 261\n However, their interventions were complex staff development packages and\n individual factors possibly contributing to the reduction in vandalism were\n not isolated.\n In an attempt to establish more clearly the direction of future research,\n the present correlational study was carried out to determine specific\n characteristics of the school environment that are related to vandalism. Prior\n research in applied behavior analysis has emphasized the immediate\n antecedents and consequences of behavior. However, Wahler and Fox (1981)\n have pointed out that socially important behaviors, such as disruptive school\n behavior, truancy, and property destruction, may be under the control of\n temporally remote stimuli or setting events rather than immediate antecedents\n and consequences. To help provide descriptive analyses of these setting events,\n Wahler and Fox advocate the use of correlational analyses. This study uses\n correlational analyses in an attempt to identify possible setting events to school\n vandalism.\n Method\n Selection of Schools\n Twenty-eight intermediate schools (grades 6, 7, & 8; 7 & 8; or 7, 8, & 9)\n in Los Angeles County participated in the study. These schools represented\n communities with a wide range of socioeconomic levels as indicated by the\n percentage of students in each school receiving aid to families with depen-\n dent children (0% to 64%). The schools\' student enrollments ranged from\n 402 to 1639.\n In most instances, letters were sent to school principals soliciting their par-\n ticipation. In some cases, such solicitation occurred at a district principals\'\n meeting. Follow-up telephone calls were made with each principal to confirm\n participation. Of 64 Los Angeles County schools contacted, 28 were selected\n due to their willingness to participate and their having readily available van-\n dalism data.\n Selection of Teachers\n In each school, three teachers were picked randomly from a list of staff\n members using a table of random numbers. Only teachers of academic sub-\n jects were selected. Special education teachers were ineligible. If a teacher\n selected by a random number did not teach an academic subject, the next\n random number was taken. All teachers selected agreed to participate in the\n study.\n Data Collection Procedures\n Vandalism. Vandalism data were obtained from each school and furnished\n by the principal or his or her secretary. The date of each incident of van-\n dalism and the cost of repairing and replacing vandalized property were\n recorded in the format shown in Figure 1 . If more than one entry was recorded\n for a particular date, the school custodian was interviewed to determine if\nThis content downloaded from 128.95.104.66 on Thu, 20 Apr 2017 19:12:01 UTC\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\n 262 MAYER, NAFPAKTITIS, BUTTERWORTH, AND HOLLINGSWORTH\n the entries represented more than one incident. All vandalism that resulted\n in any cost to the school was counted as an infraction. These events includ-\n ed graffiti, breaking of glass, equipment theft, fire, and other property\n damage.\n Figure 1. Recording sheet for occurrence and cost of vandalism.\n The cost and frequency of vandalism were calculated in units per 100\n students to account for differences in school size. Vandalism cost, then, was\n calculated by dividing the total cost of repairing or replacing property van-\n dalized during a 9-month school year by the student enrollment. This result\n was then multiplied by 100 to give a figure for each school. Vandalism fre-\n quency per 100 students was obtained by dividing the total number of in-\n cidents reported during a 9-month school year by the student enrollment.\n This result was then multiplied by 100 to give a comparative figure for each\n school.\n School discipline survey . The School Discipline Survey (SDS) (Mayer, But-\n terworth, Spaulding, et al., 1983) was used as a measure of the school\n discipline environment (see Figure 2). Three major areas contributing to a\n punitive school discipline environment were identified based on previous\n research (Mayer & Butterworth, 1979; Mayer, Butterworth, Komoto, &\n Benoit, 1983; Mayer, Butterworth, Nafpaktitis, & Sulzer-Azaroff, 1983). The\n first included clarity of both school and classroom rules and discipline policies.\n It was assumed that appropriate stimulus control, or rule following, cannot\n be developed unless discipline policies and rules are clearly communicated\n (Sulzer-Azaroff & Mayer, 1986). Further, a lack of rule following behavior\n tends to result in more punishment being used in the school environment.\n The second area involved administrative support for staff in student discipline\n (i.e., consistency and follow-through). If administrative support were weak\n or inconsistent, it certainly would not be reinforcing enough to support staff\nThis content downloaded from 128.95.104.66 on Thu, 20 Apr 2017 19:12:01 UTC\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\n SCHOOL VANDALISM 263\n O 5\n mmm wmmmmmm __ .

Such a lack of support or reinforcement is also\n aversive. The third area included allowances made for individual student\n differences in carrying out discipline policies. It was assumed that when in-\n dividual differences are recognized and addressed, the environment would\n become less punitive and more positive (Mayer & Butterworth, 1979; Mayer,\n Butterworth, Nafpaktitis, & Sulzer-Azaroff, 1983).\n The original pool of items for the SDS was generated within the above\n three categories. These items were analyzed and revised according to their\n relevance to each specific area, and also according to their adherence to basic\n criteria such as grammar, difficulty, ambiguity, and overlap.\n Through a series of conferences, the final list was shaped in preparation\n for a logical or content validation process. In this process, a panel of four\n behavioral and measurement specialists reviewed the item pool for content\n validity. All panel members had to agree to each item; items not agreed upon\n were discarded or revised. Their efforts resulted in a 28-item instrument assess-\n ing school staff perceptions of discipline policies and practices.\n Of the items included on the questionnaire some items require a "yes - no"\n response, while most items require responses on a Likert-type scale on which\n the respondent must answer, "Rarely," "Sometimes," "More Often Than Not,"\n or "Consistently." Four items require a response of "Disagree," "Somewhat\n Disagree," "Somewhat Agree," or "Agree."\n The survey was administered to the three randomly selected teachers in\n each school. They were given the survey form individually and were asked\n to return it approximately one week later. They also were told that their\n responses were anonymous and confidential and that each school\'s scores\n would be treated as a unit.\n Scoring of the survey. The maximum possible total score on the survey\n is 136 points, indicating a positively reinforcing environment with clear\n discipline policies, good administrative support, and maximum allowance\n for individual differences. Maximum score on the Clarity section (items 1-2)\n is 32. Maximum score on the Administrative Support section (items 3-16)\n is 56. Maximum score on the Individual Differences section (items 17-28) is 48.\n For items la, b, c and 2a, b, c, four points are given for a "Yes" response\n and zero points are given for a "No" response.

In order to assess\n the test-retest reliability of the survey, a second group of 69 teachers from\n three of the intermediate schools was requested to complete the question-\n naire twice at an interval of two to four weeks. A Pearson correlation\n coefficient was calculated. A high reliability coefficient of .87 was obtained\n for the total survey, .83 for Clarity, .82 for Administrative Support, and\n .62 for Individual Differences.\n In addition to its use in this correlational study, the SDS was administered\n to the staffs of six schools, four junior high schools and two high schools,\n at the beginning of a comprehensive staff development project (Nafpaktitis,\n Mayer, Hollingsworth, & Butterworth, 1982). On the 198 completed surveys,\n additional support for statistical validity was provided by data on internal\n consistency. Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients were calculated\n for the three sub-section scores and for the total score of the SDS. The inter-\n correlations between the three sub-sections were sufficiently low to indicate\n construct validity. The correlation between Clarity and Administrative Sup-\n port was .45; the correlation between Clarity and Individual Differences was\n .23; and the correlation between Administrative Support and Individual\n Differences was .39. These correlations suggest that each sub-section is\n measuring a different construct related to discipline policies and practices.\n Furthermore, Clarity and Administrative Support each correlated with the\n total score at .80 and Individual Differences correlated with the total score\n at .65.\n Results\n Table 1 presents the results of the School Discipline Survey and the van-\n dalism data for each school. The number of incidents of vandalism reported\n for the 9-month period ranged from 2 to 46. The cost of vandalism to a school\n for the 9 months ranged from $175 to $9,130. Table 2 lists the ranges, means,\n and standard deviations for all the variables.

No one of these areas by itself was found to cor-\n relate significantly with vandalism, but the combination of the three areas did.\n Because correlations indicate strength of association only and are not\n evidence of a cause and effect relationship, it might be concluded that these\n findings have little relevance to the problem of school vandalism. However,\n research evidence strongly suggests that when the predictor variables in the\n SDS scale are manipulated as treatment variables, vandalism is indeed\n affected. For example, when the punitive school environment and other\n variables were treated in two different experimental studies (Mayer & But-\n terworth, 1979; Mayer, Butterworth, Nafpaktitis, & Sulzer- Azaroff, 1983),\n vandalism costs decreased an average of 73.5% for 23 elementary and junior\n high schools. These findings complement those of Gold and Mann (1982),\n who also concluded that "poor scholastic experiences are significant causes\n of delinquent and disruptive behavior" (p. 313). They found that when cur-\n riculum was more individualized and the environment was made more rein-\n forcing, students behavior and scholastic performance improved.\n Perhaps, then, a punitive school discipline environment is a major factor\n contributing to school vandalism. The correlational evidence of this study,\n combined with the experimental evidence of other studies (Mayer & Butter-\n worth, 1979; Mayer, Butterworth, Nafpaktitis, & Sulzer-Azaroff, 1983),\n would appear to support such a conclusion. Certainly, evidence is ac-\n cumulating to suggest that the discipline environment, as measured in the\n School Discipline Survey, may be a setting event for school vandalism.\n Perhaps, then, by making the school environment more reinforcing, by reduc-\n ing the frequent misuse of behavioral procedures, and by maintaining ap-\n propriate behavior through an increased use of positive reinforcement, the\n amount of vandalism in our schools can be significantly decreased.\n In our opinion, the importance of the impact of setting events on van-\n dalism has been overlooked by educators. The emphasis instead has been\n placed on security arrangements and punishment. School staff need to be\n educated as to the relevance of setting events. "Because setting events can\n function powerfully, they all must be identified and dealt with effectively if\n we are ever durably to prevent, rather than just temporarily suppress, violence\n and vandalism in our schools" (Sulzer-Azaroff & Mayer, 1986, p. 342).\nThis content downloaded from 128.95.104.66 on Thu, 20 Apr 2017 19:12:01 UTC\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\n SCHOOL VANDALISM 269\n Additional support for the utility of the School Discipline Survey is sug-\n gested by reactions of administrators in the study. They generally reported\n that they found information on the scale to be helpful in evaluating their\n discipline policies and in planning policy changes.\n Finally, it should be recognized that even though the correlations obtained\n between the School Discipline Survey and vandalism were statistically signi-\n ficant, they were not extremely high. Addtional research studies certainly are\n warranted to identify and substantiate the existence of setting events for van-\n dalism in order to help us to better understand and prevent this pervasive\n problem. More precise measurement of vandalism, for example, might im-\n prove our identification and understanding of its setting events. Even though\n it appears impossible to measure acts of vandalism directly, future studies\n might attempt to assess the reliability of vandalism frequency and cost\n statistics by using two independent reporters or observers.\n Inter-rater reliabilities of the School Discipline Survey also should be\n studied. Factor analysis of the items of the survey might lend additional sup-\n port to the theoretically derived categories. Studies of student and parent\n responses to the survey and correlations of the survey with aggressive or\n assaultive behavior on the campus would further strengthen the survey\'s\n validity.\n In the final analysis, however, despite the low correlations, the predictors\n in the survey as setting events constitute a major departure from the tradi-\n tion of measuring school climate with vague, highly subjective categories.\n The concept of setting events with objective statements of environmental\n variables presents great potential for programmatic utility. More interven-\n tions to reduce vandalism also need to be experimentally tested. These in-\n clude studying the effect on vandalism of a clear discipline policy and studies\n comparing individualized and standardized discipline approaches.\n References\n Azrin, N.

aS'A Survey on Causes of School Vandalism\n\n\n\n\n A Survey on Causes of\n School Vandalism\n Joseph L. Venturini\n Montclair State College\n While there exists a plethora of materials in\n the literature on methods to prevent van-\n dalism in schools, sparse coverage is afforded\n the area on causes of vandalism (Violent\n Schools, 1979; Erktukel, 1974; Shnabolk,\n 1974). There does not appear to be a sys-\n tematic study or an extended discussion of\n why students vandalize schools. Most of the\n content related to causes of vandalism is\n found scattered throughout larger studies,\n and treatment is relatively limited and gen-\n eral. The causes usually cited are those of\n crime and corruption that appear to permeate\n the larger society. With youngsters sur-\n rounded by the many social disorders of the\n society, it is not unreasonable to suspect that\n this atmosphere may contribute to the vio-\n lence and vandalism found in schools. Even\n the judicial and political systems have come\n under attack as contributing factors for not\n dealing more harshly with offenders. When\n youngsters observe the lack of punishment or\n minimal punishment meted out by the courts\n to offenders, there is little to discourage them\n from committing similar acts of disruption\n and destruction.\n One other area that surfaces as a contributor\n to social problems is the family structure. Not\n only is the one-parent family a source of diffi-\n culty for youngsters, but intact families often\n fail to assume clear, strong roles in guiding,\n preparing, and encouraging children to be-\n come effective contributing members of so-\n ciety. Too often the school is force to accept\n the responsibilities of preparing youngsters\n socially and morally, when its real expertise\n and strength is in subject matter fields. When\n the socialization process from the family has\n failed, the school cannot, in most instances,\n correct this process with its current cadre of\n personnel. Discipline problems, vandalism,\n and other social dysfunctions in schools are\n usually traceable to difficulties arising out of\n family background. Most current school per-\n sonnel lack adequate training to cope with\n these problems.\n In an attempt to explore the causes of school\n vandalism, the author and a colleague went\n into the schools with a survey instrument,\n \xc2\xa9 1982 The University of North Carolina Press\n 0018-1498/82/660007-03$00.30/0\n 7\n\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\n The High School Journal- Oct/Nov 1982\n asking youngsters questions about vandalism\n problems. The instrument was a one-page\n form, asking students to respond with a "yes"\n or "no" to five sets of questions. The first\n question attempted to identify those students\n who vandalized the school by pointedly ask-\n ing if they vandalized schools. The remaining\n questions assessed home and family re-\n lations, personal feelings, the school setting,\n and the community setting. These topical\n areas were chosen from much of what the\n literature was reporting and what many\n school administrators identified from per-\n sonal interviews as causes of vandalism.\n From the over 300 responses obtained from\n middle school and high school youngsters,\n some distinct differences distinguish the stu-\n dent who vandalized schools from those who\n did not. One of the positive results of the\n study was finding that 55 percent of the stu-\n dent indicated they did not vandalize\n schools. However, it is still distressing if al-\n most one out of every two students admitted\n vandalizing schools. In terms of gender and\n school vandalism, females vandalized at\n much the same rate as males. While there was\n an attempt to assess amounts of vandalism by\n grade levels, the results were not complete.\n In discussing some of the results of the sur-\n vey, the focus will be on those individuals\n who identified themselves as vandals. Only\n those items from this group that illustrate a\n significant difference in percentages or nu-\n merical variations will be treated. While\n there has not been any scientific statistical\n treatment of the data at this time, these lim-\n ited figures should provide insight into why\n some youngsters vandalize schools.\n The category of home and family is cited in\n the literature as a possible cause of vandalism\n (Violent Schools, 1978). If the socialization\n process fails to inculcate within the child a\n respect for property or physical things, an\n attitude that promotes unnecessary des-\n truction may develop. While the majority of\n youngsters surveyed lived with their parents,\n liked their family life, could talk with their\n parents, and agreed that their parents were\n interested in their school work, some differ-\n ences were evident. Almost twice as many\n vandals indicated that they did not like their\n family life. Similarly, more than twice as\n many vandals felt they did not get enough\n freedom from home. These results indicate\n that some youngsters may attack the school to\n release frustrations that originated in the\n home.\n When students were asked questions of a\n personal nature, somewhat similar differ-\n ences appeared. More than twice as many\n vandals did not feel good about themselves,\n and 30 percent of these youngsters used drugs\n as compared with 22 percent for the non-\n vandal. In addition, the vandal worried more\n than the non-vandal, felt a need to get even\n with someone (80 percent compared to 58\n percent), and watched more violent programs\n on television (74 percent compared to 51\n percent). These figures, while not startling,\n do illustrate different behavior patterns for\n each group. The literature supports the no-\n tion that a poor self-concept could lead to\n inappropriate behavior patterns, and much\n has been written on the negative influence of\n some television programming. Drugs and al-\n cohol may be traced to irrational behaviors\n that lead to damage of property, and the need\n for money to buy drugs and alcohol may\n cause youngsters to steal and vandalize.\n Since school can be a frustrating and de-\n humanizing process for some youngsters, the\n concept of revenge seems to fulfill this need.\n Rather than lash out at an individual, young-\n sters vent their feelings on the school build-\n ing or equipment.\n The personal assessment of the individual\n section of the questionnaire appears to pro-\n vide results that support some general ideas\n related to the cause of vandalism. Youngsters\n who have poor self-concepts, who use drugs\n and alcohol, who tend to worry a lot, who feel\n a need to get even with someone, and who\n like programs of violence on television, are\n more involved in acts of school vandalism.\n The next section of the survey that had some\n significance to the causes of vandalism was\n 8\n\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\n School Vandalism\n school-related items. In categories of liking\n school, liking their teachers and principal,\n and liking courses of study, the vandals had\n percentages from 20 to 32 points lower than\n the non-vandal. They also felt that they had\n not been helped by guidance personnel and\n that their teachers were not interested in\n them. Both groups revealed similar feelings\n about their lack of input in contributing to\n school policies, and each group held positive\n attitudes toward their schoolmates.\n It would appear that the school does in-\n fluence the behavior patterns of some of its\n clientele. If school is not a "nice place" to be,\n and teachers and administrators are at odds\n with the student body, unacceptable be-\n havior may develop. These behaviors could\n lead to many dysfunctional acts by students\n toward personnel and the school building\n and equipment.\n The final category of the survey attempted to\n determine how youngsters felt about their\n communities. For the most part, almost all\n students liked their communities; however,\n more than twice as many vandals indicated a\n dislike for their community. In the area of\n after-school activities provided by the com-\n munity, approximately 60 percent in both\n groups felt the school did not provide enough\n activities. The final question assessed how\n students felt about the local police and both\n groups indicated similar results, with ap-\n proximately 50 percent suggesting the police\n were "nice guys." The results from this cate-\n gory provide little evidence that assists in\n understanding why youngsters engage in\n school vandalism. While the vandal disliked\n the community more than the non- vandal, it\n was a relatively small group of students.\n This limited survey provides data that sug-\n gest there are some basic differences in\n youngsters who vandalize schools from those\n who do not. Youngsers with family problems,\n personal problems, and school-related prob-\n lems appear more likely to vandalize schools\n than youngsters without these problems. Can\n the schools learn from these results and take\n appropriate action to reach those students\n who vandalize schools? Certainly programs\n can be developed within a reasonable time-\n frame to provide all students with a better\n school environment. Faculty and student\n groups can work together to revise curricula\n with more appropriate courses and activities.\n Workshops and meetings could be organized\n to sensitize both faculty and students to\n needs, responsibilities, and interpersonal re-\n lationships. These are initial actions that\n would lead to other more fruitful programs\n that may promote a more positive school\n climate.\n The categories of home and family would\n need to be analyzed by specialists - the\n school social worker, psychologist, and other\n related personnel - to develop programs that\n would assist families and schools in the re-\n duction of school vandalism. While this type\n of program may necessitate additional funds\n to provide a professional staff, these funds\n would probably be less than the costs of van-\n dalism. Even more important, however,\n youngsters and their families would be re-\n ceiving a much needed guidance program\n that could contribute positively to the greater\n social order.\n References\n Clements, Stanley L.

aS'COQUITLAM - The school district has experienced a spike in school vandalism;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbstract: RICHMOND - A young man charged in connection with a vicious Halloween-night swarming attack and now also facing separate robbery charges will be back in Richmond provincial court on Tuesday for a bail hearing on his latest charges. Last fall, the Integrated Homicide Investigative Team and members of the Richmond RCMP arrested the men, but investigators are still not saying whether Chan\'s death is connected with the December 1998 murder of notorious drug dealer Bindy Johal. RICHMOND - A Chinese national apprehended for allegedly trying to bring child pornography through Vancouver International Airport will be arraigned Oct. 21 in Richmond provincial court.\r\n\r\n\r\nFull text: with 26 windows broken at Moody Middle School, 19 at Hillcrest Middle and 13 at Maple Creek Middle in the week of Aug. 19 to 25.\r\nMaple Creek and Hillcrest are located in Coquitlam, while Moody Middle is in Port Moody.\r\nCheryl Quinton, communications manager for School District 43, said she\'s not exactly sure why it happened, but the time of year, coupled with the nice weather that week, may have something to do with it.\r\n"It\'s typical that vandalism rates do spike in hot weather and closer to the start of the school year," Quinton said. "Other than that, I\'m not really sure. It just happens in pockets and spurts." The last big jump in vandalism to school district buildings happened in March when there were 23 incidents of new graffiti in one week.\r\nThere had been only eight incidents of new graffiti in the previous week.\r\nVandalism cost the school district $220,000 in the 2002-2003 school year.\r\nDELTA - Two women and a man were arrested Friday after police busted an alleged marijuana grow operation at a home in the 4600 block of 45 Avenue in Ladner.\r\nOfficers seized 365 plants, with an estimated value of $135,000, and also $8,000 worth of equipment.\r\nThey also seized a .22-calibre rifle and five pounds of pre-packaged marijuana.\r\nMAPLE RIDGE - Police are looking for a 25-year-old man, described as a person of interest, in connection with a fight between a man and a woman that preceded a high-speed chase on Thursday night.\r\nJoseph Terrance Tremblay, of Maple Ridge, is the registered owner of the newer-model Ford F150 pick-up seen speeding away from the scene of the altercation, with the woman inside the vehicle.\r\nThe pursuit followed a report to police about a dispute on the street between a man and woman in the 22500-block of Royal Crescent around 11 p.m., said Corporal Rhonda Stoner of the Ridge Meadows RCMP.\r\nAs police arrived, the suspect allegedly forced the woman into the truck and drove away eastbound on the Lougheed Highway, Stoner said.\r\nThe truck was being driven erratically as the pursuit continued north on Kanaka Way at speeds exceeding 140 km/h.\r\nEventually, the truck driver eluded the police, Stoner said.\r\nPolice are now searching for Tremblay and are concerned about the well-being of the woman in the truck.\r\nTremblay is Caucasian, six-foot-three with short brown hair and hazel eyes.\r\nPolice say there\'s an outstanding warrant for his arrest for uttering threats.\r\nThe woman is in her early 20\'s, Caucasian with blonde hair and dark clothing.\r\nThe 2004 Ford F150 pick-up truck is silver with the B.C. license plate 043 7HJ.\r\nAnyone with information on Tremblay\'s whereabouts is asked to call Ridge Meadows RCMP at 604-463-6251.\r\nNORTH VANCOUVER District residents are being invited to help save their local shores on Sept. 11.\r\nThe Save our Shores Group is asking people to meet up at the group s tent, near the Cates Park concession building, at 10 a.m. for the annual Save our Shores Beach Clean Up.\r\nWear old clothes, sturdy footwear and gloves and bring a snack and drinking water. The clean-up will continue until 1 p.m.\r\nNORTH VANCOUVER A former bookkeeper, who is serving a conditional sentence for taking almost $250,000 of taxpayer money from the coffers of the municipal golf course where she worked, was back in court Wednesday.\r\nIn June, Christie Hammond was sentenced to two years minus a day for the fraud, to be served in the community.\r\nHammond was back in court Aug. 25 because of a number of complaints regarding the four hours she is allowed for personal time in the community as part of her house arrest.\r\nCrown prosecutor Teresa Mitchell-Banks argued that the personal time should be fixed to a certain day and time period, so people in the community will know if she is violating the terms of her sentence.\r\nDefence lawyer Tim Ellan argued that if people feel that Hammond is violating her sentence, they can complain and if she is in contravention, it will be dealt with.\r\nJudge Judith Gedye did not fix Hammond s personal time, but said Hammond must serve her 100 hours of community service in the final two-thirds of her sentence, instead of the first third, and the personal time is on top of time she can take for things such as counselling or medical and dental appointments.\r\nNORTH VANCOUVER The PNE isn t the only gig in town this Sunday.\r\nDeep Cove is celebrating its Deep Cove Daze on Aug. 29 at Panorama Park with music, magic, food, dog shows, tea, a dunk tank, midway rides and games.\r\nPresented by Musart, the day starts at 10:30 a.m. with a pancake breakfast put on by the Seymour Lions and continues with bands on the main stage from 1 p.m. until 7:30 p.m., presentations and plays on the side stage until 5 p.m.\r\nand entertainment throughout the day until 9:30 p.m.\r\nLocal merchants and artisans will sell their wares and a food court and midway snacks will keep bellies full.\r\nA shuttle bus will be available from Dollarton Centre and Parkgate Centre.\r\nAdmission is free, but donations will be gratefully accepted.\r\nPORT MOODY -

A 20-year-old local man who allegedly posted personal information about police officers on the internet will go to trial June 1, 2005.\r\nMichael Christopher Dejong appeared in Richmond provincial court to have a trial date set on charges, including criminal harassment and uttering threats, in connection with a website that reportedly had pictures of unmarked police cars and the addresses of officers\' homes.\r\nAccording to police, the website included the name of Richmond RCMP Superintendent Ward Clapham s wife, their phone number and a map of their residential area.\r\nThe website allegedly also contained threats of harm.\r\nThe RCMP said it has dealt with the man before, but won\'t reveal what had been going on in the past.\r\nDejong was also recently charged with separate counterfeit money and drug offences.\r\nHe\'s free on bail.\r\nRICHMOND - A young man charged in connection with a vicious Halloween-night swarming attack and now also facing separate robbery charges will be back in Richmond provincial court on Tuesday for a bail hearing on his latest charges.\r\nChristopher Marshall was arrested last month for several of robberies involving food delivery people.\r\nHe is also one of the four men charged for an Oct. 31, 2003, attack on Kostyantin Rogozin, 45, and his wife Valentina.\r\nThe Rogozins were driving in the 8600 block of Bennett Road when a large group of people allegedly surrounded their car and beat up the husband.\r\nRichmond RCMP later said it was a case of mistaken identity, and the couple were in the wrong place at the wrong time.\r\nAlso charged in that case is Marshall\'s brother, Brett Marshall, and Matthew Dale Kitts.\r\nThe three won\'t be going to trial until next April.\r\nA fourth person charged, Eduardo Ernesto Medrano, 21, was handed a conditional discharge for mischief after pleading guilty.\r\nRICHMOND - A preliminary hearing will begin Nov. 8 in Richmond provincial court for three of four men charged in connection with the May 2003 death of a member of the Lotus Gang.\r\nMichael Andrew Mercredi and Justine Nethanial Po, both 28, and Aharon Lee Campbell, 22, are charged with the first-degree murder of Raymond Man Yuen Chan, 31.\r\nChan\'s beaten and bloodied body was discovered in an alley at 5740 Cedarbridge Way, behind the Richmond court building.\r\nAlso charged with first-degree in the case is Mark James Thrower, 35.\r\nHis preliminary hearing was held separately. He will stand trial in February.\r\nLast fall, the Integrated Homicide Investigative Team and members of the Richmond RCMP arrested the men, but investigators are still not saying whether Chan\'s death is connected with the December 1998 murder of notorious drug dealer Bindy Johal.\r\nJohal had been facing charges of extortion and unlawful confinement for the alleged kidnapping of Chan\'s younger brother, Randy, apparently after a drug deal went bad.\r\nAlso charged in Randy Chan\'s kidnapping was Johal associate Roman Mann, but before going to trial he was also murdered. Mann\'s body was dumped in a Richmond industrial park.\r\nRICHMOND - A Chinese national apprehended for allegedly trying to bring child pornography through Vancouver International Airport will be arraigned Oct. 21 in Richmond provincial court.\r\nJing Chen Wang, 32, was arrested and charged July 24 with possession of child pornography.\r\nThe pornography was reportedly found on his personal computer after customs officials questioned him.\r\nHe was released on $10,000 cash bail.\r\nRICHMOND - A 19-year-old Vancouver man charged with attempted murder in connection with a drive-by shooting outside a local McDonald\'s will be arraigned Tuesday in Richmond provincial court.\r\nAvtar Singh Kaur is charged with an April 28 shooting outside the restaurant at Bridgeport Road and Sweden Way.\r\nAccording to the RCMP, numerous shots were fired by at least one man at a group of young men standing outside.\r\nAnother 19-year-old man may have been the intended target, said police.\r\nThe man believed to be the intended target was reportedly involved in an altercation with a female in Vancouver a few hours earlier.\r\nAn off-duty officer inside McDonalds saw what happened and managed to keep the potential witnesses at the scene before they could leave.\r\nA second young man was arrested in the case but charges against him were later stayed.\r\nRICHMOND - An 18-year-old former Cambie Secondary School student will be sentenced Sept. 23 for a bullying incident at the school.\r\nWilson Wan Yiu Chan, 18, was charged, along with two young offenders, earlier this year with three counts of extortion and assault in connection with incidents involving six students from the school.\r\nChan later agreed to plead guilty to a reduced charge of threatening.\r\nChan and his co-accused allegedly forced the students to give them money, but several other students who witnessed what was happening notified school staff.\r\nThe RCMP was then called in to investigate and the victims agreed to cooperate.\r\nChan will be sentenced in Richmond provincial court.\r\nSURREY - A trial will begin Jan. 26 for a 43-year-old man facing charges in connection with a crash that claimed the life of a motorcyclist.\r\nAntonio Pacheco Daponte is charged with various counts, including impaired driving and dangerous driving causing death, following a May 18 incident on 232nd Street in Langley.\r\nAccording to RCMP, a pick-up traveling west on 24th Avenue failed to stop at a stop sign at the intersection of 232nd Street and struck a motorcycle driven by David Ronald Coburn, 24, who was killed instantly.\r\nDaponte is out on bail after positing a $50,000 surety in Surrey provincial court.\r\nSURREY -

A preliminary hearing will begin Nov. 15 in Surrey provincial court for a local youth pastor charged with sex offences against a teenage boy.\r\nCecil Rast, 43, is charged with sexual assault, sexual exploitation and sexual interference for alleged incidents committed between 1995 and 1999.\r\nAccording to Surrey RCMP, the incidents happened while the pastor with the Youth for Christ Organization counselled the boy, and started when the complainant was 13 and finished when he was 17.\r\nRast, who has no criminal record, is out on bail on the condition he stay away from anyone under 18.\r\nSURREY - One of three men arrested following an alleged shooting incident on July 27 will be back in Surrey provincial court on Wednesday for a bail hearing.\r\nChristian Fulmer was charged with several offences, including aggravated assault and intent to wound using a firearm, after an incident involving two vehicles in the area of 84th Avenue and King George Highway.\r\nAccording to police, an argument broke out between the drivers of two cars in the early morning hours and someone in one of the cars shot several times at the second vehicle.\r\nOne person in the second vehicle was hit and suffered non-life-threatening injuries.\r\nThe suspect vehicle then fled, but police located it in the Cloverdale area and stopped it after a chase into Langley.\r\nA police dog was called in to track the alleged driver and Fulmer was subsequently arrested.\r\nHe was later treated for dog bites.\r\nSURREY - A man arrested last month for numerous car thefts and high-speed incidents will be back in Surrey provincial court Aug. 31 trying to get bail.\r\nRobert Osborne, 29, was apprehended after more than 15 Canada-wide arrest warrants were issued for him.\r\nHe was nabbed trying to make a run for it through a Surrey Superstore after ditching a stolen Ford F150 that smashed several fences.\r\nShortly before he was caught, the Surrey RCMP also sent out a warning that Osborne\'s paranoid behaviour and driving posed a serous risk to public safety.\r\nOsborne told a judge at an earlier court proceeding that he felt compelled to run when the RCMP issued a release that he was one of its most wanted car thieves.\r\nSURREY - A 24-year old man who pleaded guilty to stealing a vehicle didn\'t want to spend any more time in jail where things got a little rough for him.\r\nStuart Gregg was arrested June 16 after officers from the RCMP auto theft unit saw him driving a stolen 1994 Dodge Caravan.\r\nGiven a conditional sentence for other property offences earlier this year, he was carrying tools including a screwdriver used to steel the vehicle.\r\n"It\'s becoming all too routine in Surrey," said Crown lawyer Jim Lees.\r\nGregg\'s lawyer said the man doesn\'t want to spend any more time in jail because he was beaten up while in bed at the pre-trial centre and he\'s now in segregation.\r\nThe lawyer also noted Gregg is dealing with a crystal meth addiction, but has a good attitude in wanting to kick the habit.\r\nCiting his criminal record, the judge, handed him nine-month jail sentence minus time served for his latest crime.\r\nSURREY - A local man charged with possession of child pornography will be back in Surrey provincial court Sept. 7 for a possible guilty plea and disposition.\r\nJohn Ferguson was charged earlier this year after a computer repairman allegedly found images on Ferguson\'s personal computer.\r\nThe Crown noted that due to the circumstances of the case, the prosecution will likely only seek a peace bond for Ferguson which doesn\'t carry a criminal record but restricts his behaviour.\r\nWEST VANCOUVER A New Westminster man could be charged with three counts of uttering counterfeit money after he allegedly used fake $10 bills while shopping at Caulfield Plaza on Aug. 26.\r\nAn employee of one of the stores that the 20-year-old bought items from became suspicious of some $10 bills the suspect used and called 911.\r\nPolice arrived and found the man in the plaza s liquor store and arrested him.

aS'JOURNAL OF APPLIED BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS PREVENTING SCHOOL VANDALISM AND IMPROVING DISCIPLINE: A THREE-YEAR STUDY\n\n\n\n\nVandalism is a major problem facing educators and taxpayers alike. The present investigation\nanalyzed how vandalism costs and student disruption were related to the implementation\nof a training and consultation package designed to increase the reinforcing ambience\nof the school. A positive environment, it was posited, would displace previous events\nthat may have set the occasion for vandalism, with cues to promote productive school\nperformance. Eighteen elementary and junior high schools were involved over a 3-year\nperiod. Using a delayed treatment control design, treatment was delivered following\neither 4 or 13 months of baseline. During treatment, teams of school personnel attended\ntraining workshops in behavioral strategies for reducing vandalism and disruption by\nstudents in school. Each team also met regularly on its campus to plan and implement\nprograms on a schoolwide basis. To demonstrate that reinforcing procedures were\nactually implemented and accompanied by change in student performance, these variables\nwere periodically probed throughout the study. Project staff also provided consultation.\nVandalism costs decreased significantly (p < .05) more in treatment than control schools,\nwith an average reduction of 78.5 % for all project schools. Rates of praise delivered by\nproject teachers and other randomly selected teachers in the school increased significantly\n(p < .05), and rates of off-task behavior by students decreased significantly (p < .05)\nfollowing treatment. The staff development model used in this study appeared to be\nboth feasible and economical.\nDESCRIPTORS: vandalism, setting events, school environment, classroom, staff\nmanagement\nSchool vandalism, a complex problem area of\nextreme social importance, is increasing in magnitude.\nNationwide, over 5,000 assaults on\nThis project was funded by an Elementary and Secondary\nEducation Act Title IV-C Grant and the\nOffice of the Los Angeles County Superintendent of\nSchools. The authors thank Dorothy Burstein, Dave\nCrocker, Randy Howell, Janelle Hussey, Ken Johnson,\nJudy Jones, Paul Kaplan, Ted Komoto, Venetia\nLouie, Pat Radi, Betsy Smith, Helen Susek, and Nancy\nVan Derveer for their assistance in data collection or\nconsultation. Reprints of this manuscript may be obtained\nfrom G. Roy Mayer, Department of Counselor\nEducation, California State University at Los Angeles,\nLos Angeles, California 90032.

It was reported in a recent Los\nAngeles County School Attendance and Welfare\nBulletin (Note 1) that in school districts\nthroughout Los Angeles County the average\nvandalism costs were in excess of $8.5 million\nfor the 1978-1979 school year, a 56% increase\nover the 1977-1978 school year. Additional indirect\nexpenses are incurred by school districts\nfor insurance, security guards, and other presumed\ndeterrents to vandalism. These expenses\nappear to exceed the cost of repairing the effects\nof vandalism. The Los Angeles Unified School\nDistrict\'s Security Section, for example, had a\n355\n1983, 16, 355-369 NUMBER 4 (WINTER 1983)\nG. ROY MAYER et al.\nbudget of about $10 million for personnel salaries\nalone, an increase of nearly $4 million\nsince 1978.\nSuperficial logic would suggest that improved\nmethods of detection and punishment would\nameliorate vandalism. However, the introduction\nof heavy security arrangements may well\naggravate the very problem that this kind of\ndeterrence is intended to eliminate, due to a\nresultant increase in the aversive nature of the\nenvironment (Greenberg, 1974). Other prescriptive\napproaches have also been less than successful\n(Gee, 1974, Ziesel, 1976). For example,\nProject PRIDE (Note 2), which stressed a clean\ncampus and provided special plaques for individuals\nor groups who engaged in "campus\npride" activities, appeared to produce only temporary\neffects, perhaps because they did not\nidentify and treat factors that appear to foster\nvandalism.\nMethods to reduce vandalism are just beginning\nto be experimentally investigated. For example,\nMayer and Butterworth (1979) pilottested\nthe first experimental intervention package\nthat was designed to treat setting factors\nthat appeared to foster vandalism within the\nelementary school environment through consultation\nand inservice activities. They demonstrated\na 57% average decrease in the cost of\nrepairing vandalized property for 10 experimental\nschools, whereas the average costs for 9\ncontrol schools increased 320%. Further, students\nattended more to class work, positive\nteacher-student contacts improved or remained\nsignificantly higher, and students\' inappropriate\nbehavior decreased more in the experimental\nthan in the control schools.\nWahler and Fox (1981) have proposed "that\nbehavior analysts should increase the range of\nenvironmental phenomena that they seek to\nmanipulate and relate to the changes in socially\nimportant behaviors" (p. 328). They go on to\nsuggest that many behavior problems such as\nstealing, fighting, truancy, and property destruction\nmay be approached through operating on\ntemporally remote stimuli, or setting events.\nSeveral complex and temporally distant conditions\nof the school environment have been posited\nby Mayer and Butterworth (1979) to contribute\ntoward promoting vandalism. These\npotential setting events include: (a) a mismatch\nbetween student reading level and the difficulty\nof assigned materials; (b) the prevalence of punishment\nas a schoolwide and classroom management\nprocedures; and, (c) otherwise misusing\nbehavior management procedures.\nWhen assigned reading materials do not\nmatch the student\'s repertoire of skills, boredom\nor frustration may result. Many students, particularly\nthose whose reading ability does not\npermit them to complete their assignments successfully,\nare more apt to experience defeat, reproach,\nridicule, and other probable aversive\nconsequences. This combination of extinction\nand punishment may also serve to imbue scholastic\nactivities and materials with conditioned\naversive properties.\nFindings from the experimental analysis of\nbehavior have taught us that extinction and punishment\ntend to provoke aggression and destruction\nin laboratory animals (Azrin, Hutchinson,\n& Hake, 1963; Azrin & Holz, 1966; Azrin, Note\n3). By analogy it is reasonable to hypothesize\nthat some proportion of the aggression and destruction\nin the form of vandalism that takes\nplace in public schools is a reaction to those very\nsame factors. This seems probable in light of\nfindings that teacher disapproval generally occurs\nat least three times more frequently than\nteacher approval (Thomas, Presland, Grant, &\nGlen, 1978). Further complicating the situation\nis the fact that aggressive behavior is reinforced,\noften inadvertently, by school authorities via\nattention and by peers in the form of approval\nand media attention, thereby increasing aggression\nand promoting its generalization across settings\n(Horton, 1970).\nIn accordance with Wahler and Fox\'s (1981)\nproposal-"that behavior analysts should increase\nthe range of environmental phenomena\nthat they seek to manipulate and relate to the\nchanges in socially important behavior" (p. 328)\nSCHOOL VANDALISM AND DISCIPLINE\n-the present study, which spans a 3-year period,\nattempted to manipulate the potential setting\nevents described above in an effort to reduce\nthe costs of vandalism. Presumably then, the aggressiveness\nand destructiveness engendered by\nextinction and punishment would be supplanted\nby more pro-social reactions. It was this basic\nassumption that this program of research was designed\nto test.\nAlthough the main thrust of this study was\nto assess the influence of the training package\non rates of vandalism, it was important to demonstrate\nthat constructive change in the performance\nof teachers and students was actually\nimplemented. Consequently, periodic probes of\npraise by teachers and disruptive and on- and\noff-task behavior by students were taken. Additionally,\nto examine the practicality of intervening\nwith representatives of the instructional\nstaff rather than a more costly method of involving\neveryone directly in training, the "spillover"\neffect of the program to teachers who had\nneither attended the workshops nor received\nregularly scheduled direct consultation was also\nassessed.\nMETHODS\nSelection of Schools\nTwenty schools, which had not participated\nin the pilot study by Mayer and Butterworth\n(1979), from 12 districts in Los Angeles County\nwere selected from a list of volunteers because\nthese schools maintained systems for gathering\ndata on vandalism costs, and their students\' average\nreading scores on the Comprehensive Test\nof Basic Skills were below the 45th percentile\nnationally. Ten of the schools were assigned\nrandomly to an experimental treatment condition,\nGroup I, and 10 to a delayed treatment\ncondition, Group II. One control school and one\nexperimental school withdrew due to disinterest\nof the staff. Five elementary and four junior\nhigh schools in each group completed the first\nyear of the project. Data were collected in an\nidentical fashion in all schools.\nThe control schools in Group II were provided\nwith the opportunity to receive services\nfrom the project staff during the second and\nthird year. Seven of the nine participated during\nthe second year, and six during the third year.\nThe Group I schools were invited to continue\nparticipation in the project for second and third\nyears, receiving essentially follow-up services.\nDue to administrative and other staff changes,\nonly six of the nine Group I schools continued\nduring the second year, and five during the third\nyear, leaving three elementary and two junior\nhigh schools in Group I, and three elementary\nand three junior high schools in Group II by the\nthird year.\nSelection of Teachers\nTwo teachers from grades 4 through 8 were\nselected for extended participation in each of\nthe 18 schools. Each site principal was asked to\nselect two "model" teachers following the selection\ncriteria described by Mayer and Butterworth\n(1979). These teachers were to have demonstrated\na willingness to try new ideas, had\ngained the respect of their fellow staff members\n(enhancing their effectiveness as models to other\nteachers), and expressed a willingness to commit\nthe time to work with the principal and\npsychologist in developing programs to reduce\nvandalism and disruption.\nEach principal also selected two other teachers\nat random from the same grades to serve as\nbarometer teachers, the only criterion being a\nwillingness to allow observers into the classroom.\nThese teachers were included to measure\nthe "spillover" effect taking place within the\nproject school. To reduce the bias of this measure,\nno deliberate attempt was made to consult\nwith them.\nSelection of Students\nSix students in each of the project barometer\nclassrooms were randomly selected from a preidentified\ngroup of students who had scored\n10% below their class average on the Reading\nComprehension and Vocabulary sections of the\n357\nG. ROY MAYER et al.\nComprehensive Test of Basic Skills and were at\nleast 10% above the classroom average in offtask\nbehavior (nonattending and disruptive behavior).\nThe off-task behavior was measured\nduring three classroom observations using the\nBehavioral Assessment Instrument (Mayer &\nButterworth, 1979). These students were selected\non the assumption that they could most\nbenefit from the treatment program and were\nobserved at scheduled intervals.\nConsultants\nSix graduate students, working toward their\nschool counseling and school psychology credentials\nat California State University, Los Angeles,\nserved as part-time consultants or data collectors\nto the project schools during the first two\nyears of the study. Each graduate student had\nformal university training in applied behavior\nanalysis using the texts written by Sulzer-Azaroff\nand Mayer (1977) and Mayer and McGookin\n(Note 4). Two consultants were assigned to each\ntreatment school. One was primarily responsible\nfor data collection and the other for consulting\nwith school staff. During the third year, the number\nof graduate students was reduced to five.\nTwo of the five were responsible for consulting.\nThe other three were responsible for data collection\nand did not consult with teachers.\nWorkshop Presenters\nA project director (second author) and a chief\nconsultant (first author) presented the workshops.\nThe project director had a doctorate in\neducational psychology, training and experience\nin applied behavior analysis, and experience in\nschool psychology. The chief consultant was professor\nof education and experienced in staff development\nand in training school counselors and\nschool psychologists in behavior analysis.\nData Collection and Measures\nVandalism was the response of primary interest,\nbut because acts of vandalism occur surreptitiously,\nthey are essentially impossible to\nobserve and one must use indirect measures. In\nthis case it was decided that the products of vandalism\nwould be measured by means of the cost\nrequired to repair the damage that had been\ncaused. The other measures were selected for a\ndifferent reason: to demonstrate that the intervention\ndid actually take place; that teachers did\nindeed begin to implement the new skills they\nwere taught during training and consultation\nsessions. Rates of praise by teachers and changes\nin task performance by students were selected\nbecause they were presumed to epitomize\nchanges within the school climate. Further, at\nsome time in the future it might be shown that\nincreases in rates of praise by teachers and increases\nin on-task behavior by students reliably\ncontribute toward reductions in acts of vandalism\n(or aggression or other antisocial acts).\nVandalism costs. Vandalism data were collected\nin the same manner as in the Mayer and\nButterworth (1979) study. The costs of repairing\nand replacing vandalized property were provided\nfor each academic month by the project\nschools, and included the costs to replace or repair\nbroken glass, equipment theft, fire damage,\nand property damage. The data sought and obtained\nwere the same as those reported to the\nstate. To compare expenses among schools, costs\nwere reported per 100 students.\nStudent and teacher behavior. The Behavioral\nAssessment Instrument was used by the project\nconsultants to probe the six selected students\'\noff-task and attending behavior, and each teacher\'s\nrate and kind of positive reinforcement\ndirected toward the students. The Behavioral\nAssessment Instrument uses a time-sampling\nprocedure in which the first student is observed\nfor 10 sec and the student\'s behavior recorded\nduring the following 5 sec. This process is repeated\nfor all students being observed. During\nthe fourth and eighth 10-sec intervals, the\nteacher\'s behavior is observed and the type of\nreinforcement, if any, recorded-just as with the\nstudents. This procedure is continued until 10\nobservations are collected for each student and\n358\nSCHOOL VANDALISM AND DISCIPLINE\n20 observations for the teacher. These observations\nare completed in 20 min. Three categories\nof student behavior were recorded. Disruption\nwas defined as behaviors that disturb either the\nteacher or students by drawing attention to the\nstudent, such as talking without permission, hitting,\nyelling, making noises by voice or with\nobjects, and out of seat behavior that causes\nother students to look at the disruptor. Non\ntask was defined as behaviors that do not disturb\nothers but do not contribute to completion of\nassignments-behaviors such as reading during\nmath, looking out the window, or head on desk.\nAttending was defined as behaviors related to\nassigned activities, such as eyes directed toward\nteachers when they are talking, eyes directed\ntoward work, doing assignments, answering\nquestions, and getting supplies.\nPraise included specific praise and general\npraise. Specific praise was defined as the delivery\nof praise paired with the rationale or\nreason for its delivery, e.g., "Great, you were able\nto remember that 9 times 4 is 36." General\npraise (a generic term used for purposes of simplicity)\nconsisted of positive evaluative statements,\nrephrasing what a student said, approving\ngestures, positive physical contact, and recognition\n(without reference to a specific behavior).\nTypical general praise included saying, "That\'s\ngood," or smiling, winking, and calling on students\nwhen they asked for recognition. Praise\ncould have been delivered to an individual, the\nwhole class, or to a subgroup of students within\nthe class. In all cases, however, teacher responses\nwere scored as praise only if directed to students\nwhen they were attending.\nAfter allowing for adaptation, baseline data\nwere collected each year during the last 2 weeks\nin November and the first week in December.\nThree observations, one per week, were made in\neach of the four classrooms (two project and\ntwo barometer) in each school during that\nperiod. An interim assessment consisting of three\nobservations in all schools was made during\nFebruary, and the final assessment, again consisting\nof three observations, was completed during\nthe last 3 weeks of May 1978, 1979, and\n1980 following the same procedures used for\nbaseline.\nInterobserver agreement. Observer reliability\nassessments initially occurred during observer\ntraining with a videotape of a fifth-grade classroom\nThe observers had to obtain an agreement\ncoefficient of at least .85 with a scoring key before\nobserving a live classroom. More than 20\nreliability assessments for student and teacher\nbehavior were also completed during the adaptation,\nbaseline, interim, and final observation\nperiods. Each school consultant and a trained\nindividual unfamiliar with the project simultaneously\nobserved a classroom and independently\nrecorded student and teacher behavior.\nEach reliability session lasted 20 min. The interobserver\nagreement was calculated by dividing\nthe number of agreements by the number of\ndisagreements for scored intervals (occurrences\nonly) and ranged from .86 to 1.0 with a mean\nof .93.\nProcedure\nThe schedule of implementation of staff development\nactivities is summarized in Table 1.\nThe table shows that the frequency of workshops\nand consultation contacts was gradually reduced\nover the 3-year period.\nThe consultants followed a standard procedure\nin that they assisted teachers in implementing\nprograms that were either introduced in the\ninservice workshops or described by Butterworth\n(Note 5). In addition, consultants followed the\nconsulting format outlined in Table 2 and\nelaborated in Behavioral Consulting (Mayer &\nMcGookin, Note 4).\nFirst project year (1977-1978). After baseline\ndata collection, the project consultants began\nvisiting and consulting with each project classroom\nteacher in the experimental schools on an\naverage of twice a week. They arranged and conducted\napproximately two team meetings per\nmonth at each school. These were attended by\n359\nG.

Each team attempted\nto identify and eliminate the conditions that\nfoster vandalism and that hinder academic and\npersonal-social development. This process involved\nworking with the school staff in developing\nclassroom and schoolwide programs that\nwould teach students alternative behavior to\nvandalism and disruption. For example, lunchroom\nand playground management programs\nand classroom management programs were\nplanned that stressed the use of specific positive\nreinforcement (Bernhart & Forehand, 1975),\nwith students being informed as to which of\ntheir behaviors were being reinforced or recognized.\nThe teams also planned community activities,\nsuch as neighborhood walks, to inform citizens\nof the school\'s concern with stopping\nvandalism and to solicit their cooperation. Involvement\nby youth clubs was sought in some\nschools to help keep the campus clean and to\ndecide how to use money saved from reduced\nvandalism costs. These programs are described\nin detail elsewhere by Butterworth (Note 5).\nTen workshops were presented between the\nmiddle of October and the end of May.

Share results!\nintroductory workshops scheduled prior to the\nonset of treatment did not include programs and\nstrategies for dealing with discipline and vandalism\nproblems. Rather, these workshops introduced\nconsultation skills that participants used\nto assist teachers in implementing the treatment\nstrategies which were not presented until after\nbaseline. Because of the holidays during December\nand planning necessary for program implementation\nand enlisting student involvement,\nteachers and school teams were unable\n360\nSCHOOL VANDALISM AND DISCIPLINE\nto start implementing programs until January.\nFor this reason, vandalism costs prior to January\n1 (see Figure 1) were attributed to pretreatment\neffects.\nFunds were provided to the districts to be ased\nto hire substitutes for the 18 teachers attending\nthe training sessions. Only the school psychologists\nand counselors were requested to attend all\n10 workshops. Activities at four of their meetings\nincluded learning and practicing behavioral\nconsultation skills and analyzing school and\nclassroom environments (Mayer & McGookin,\nNote 4), and sharing alternative strategies and\nmaterials used by teachers to improve classroom\nenvironments (Kaplan, Kohfeldt, & Sturla,\n1974; Sulzer-Azaroff & Mayer, 1977). These\nmeetings were also attended by one or two of\nthe school principals, although principals were\nnot required to attend. Four of the 10 meetings\nwere designed for the entire school team (principal,\npsychologist, or counselor, or both, and\ntwo project teachers) to deal with classroom and\nschoolwide discipline and vandalism problems\nencountered by different schools. Attendance at\nthese meetings was close to 100%. The first\nteam workshop began immediately after the collection\nof baseline data. A presentation of preliminary\nresults was given at the last meeting\nfor the principals, psychologists, and counselors.\nThe content of all 10 workshops is described\nelsewhere (Butterworth, Note 5; Nafpaktitis,\nMayer, Butterworth, & Jones, Note 6) and was\npresented through lecture, audiovisual materials,\nand simulation activities. Tables 2 and 3 list the\ntopics included.\nNone of the other teachers in the school, including\nthe barometer teachers, attended the offcampus\nworkshops. However, any teacher was\nwelcome to receive consultation services on request.\nTypically three to five teachers in a school\nrequested and received such services each year\nwith usually one of these being a barometer\nteacher.\nSecond project year (1978-1979). The treatment\nthat was given to the 1977-1978 experimental\nschools during the first year was pro-\nTable 3\nTopics and activities included in team training workshops.\nBehavioral Concepts\nConditions that engender school vandalism and disruption\nAntivandalism programs\nPositive reinforcement\nMethods of identifying reinforcers\nNegative reinforcement\nExtinction\nReinforcing alternative responses\nModeling\nDifferential reinforcement of low rates\nDifferential reinforcement of other responses\nResponse cost\nTime-out\nOvercorrection\nPunishment and its side effects\nPractical Applications\nUsing certificates and awards\nImproving staff morale\nTeaching students to get positive recognition\nTeaching students to reinforce teachers\nReadability assessment procedures\nAdapting material to student reading level\nPositive reinforcement bombardment\nSecret Pal Game\nI Spy Game\nGood Behavior Game\nSlot Machine Game\nOther group contingency games and programs\nToken systems\nDaily report cards\nSchool discipline plans\nvided for the control, or Group II schools, during\nthe second year of the project. Group I schools\nwere provided three off-campus workshops\nwhich only the psychologist and principal were\nrequested to attend. These workshops were intended\nto provide a follow-up to the work begun\nthe previous year and to invite the participants\nto share programs and projects going on at their\nsites.\nConsulting with school site personnel began\nduring October 1978 in the Group I schools, because\ntreatment had already started the previous\nyear. Through on-campus team meetings, assessment\nof present school needs was made, and\nthe previous year\'s schoolwide programs (i.e.,\ncafeteria or playground improvement, reducG.\nROY MAYER et al.\ntion in tardiness, community improvement) were\nreevaluated. Consultants visited each project\nclassroom on the average of once a week to assist\nthe teacher in implementing programs or to\ncollect observational data.\nWhile consulting in the experimental schools,\nsome of the project staff collaborated with the\nteam that had been involved in the county workshops\nin conducting several workshops directly\nin the schools. These were attended by an interested\nstaff and covered material similar to that\nof the original workshops. An average of two\nsuch workshops was held in almost every school.\nThird project year (1979-1980). Consulting\nbegan in early October 1979, and continued\nthrough May 1980 in the remaining 11 schools\nat a reduced rate. Each consultant was required\nto spend one-half day every other week at each\nschool as services continued to be phased out.\nTeam meetings were organized and scheduled\nevery 2 to 4 weeks. At these meetings, possible\nadditions to and changes in existing schoolwide\nbehavior improvement programs were discussed\nand planned. Consultants endeavored to work\nclosely with the school psychologist, when available,\nand with the principal, while modeling\nconsulting behavior and providing feedback and\nreinforcement to all who were involved in behavior\nchange programs. Efforts were continued,\nas in prior years, to include as many site personnel\nas were willing to participate, including\nstudent groups.\nA series of five workshops was presented, and\ninvolved interested principals and psychologists.\nFour of these workshops offered instruction in\nimproving consultation skills (see Table 2 and\nMayer & McGookin, Note 4) to enable the\nprincipals and psychologists to enhance their\nability to continue the project at its termination.\nThe material was presented through lecture, simulation\nactivities by project staff, and role playing\nby participants. The fifth workshop was set\naside as a sharing period, and project participants\nwere invited to discuss programs and\nprojects going on at their sites.\nFeedback to teachers. During the first year\nof the project, behavioral data on teachers\' types\nand amount of praise and students\' behavior\nwere graphed and shared with the project teachers\nin the experimental schools. During years\ntwo and three, this feedback was given to all\nproject teachers. A minimum of three informal\nmeetings between the consultant and each individual\nproject teacher (except in control schools\nthe first year) were held each year to discuss the\nbehavioral data. Feedback was accompanied by\nsocial praise to maximize its usefulness (Cossairt,\nHall, & Hopkins, 1973). During the third\nyear only, barometer teachers were informed\nby the consultant that these data ware available\nfrom the consultant if they were interested in\nreceiving them.\nExperimental Design\nThe intervention program consisted of a\n"package" including inservice training of selected\nstaff members, on-site consultation with\nselected teachers, consultation with other teachers\nwho requested service, and establishing a\nteam at each school to develop schoolwide programs.\nThe experimental design was applied to\nthe total intervention "package" without an\nanalysis of the relative contributions by individual\ncomponents to outcomes. A delayed\ntreatment control (multiple baseline) design was\nused with schools randomly assigned to control\nand experimental conditions. The pre-post gain\nscore variables were also compared between the\ncontrol and experimental groups. In the case of\nvandalism cost, the number of schools that increased\nor decreased was compared. Thus, a\nnumber of different analyses were permitted due\nto the large sample sizes.\nRESULTS\nVandalism\nFirst year. For each school the average\nmonthly vandalism cost per 100 students during\nJanuary through May 1978 (the time span that\nthe full complement of personnel were involved\nin program implementation) was subtracted\n362\nSCHOOL VANDALISM AND DISCIPLINE\nfrom the average monthly vandalism cost per\n100 students during September through December\n1977 (the "baseline" period for schools receiving\ntreatment for the first year). Each school\nwas identified as having increased or decreased\nin cost of vandalism. According to this analysis\nduring the first year of the experiment, vandalism\ndecreased in six of nine schools receiving\ntreatment but in only one of nine schools not receiving\ntreatment. Application of the Fisher Exact\nProbability Test (Seigel, 1956), selected for\nits suitability with discrete ordinal data of small\nsample size, determined that significantly more\ntreated than untreated schools experienced a decrease\nin the cost of repairing or replacing vandalized\nproperty (p < .05).\nSecond year. For the schools that began receiving\ntreatment in January 1979 (Group II),\nthe average monthly vandalism cost per 100\nstudents during January through May 1979 was\nsubtracted from the average monthly vandalism\ncost per 100 students during September through\nDecember 1978. On this basis, each of these\nschools was identified as having increased or decreased\nin costs of vandalism during the second\nyear of the experiment. It was previously determined\nthat one of nine of these schools improved\nwithout treatment during their first year\nas controls in the study. This compared with\nfive of seven of the same schools that improved\nafter treatment during the second year. Application\nof the Fisher Exact Probability Test indicated\nthat significantly more schools experienced\na decrease in the cost of vandalism after treatment\n(i.e., the second year) than before treatment\n(i.e., the first year) (p < .05).\nAll three years. Figure 1 shows the dollar\ncost per 100 students of repairing and replacing\nvandalized property (without adjusting for inflation)\nfor all schools that participated in the\nstudy for at least 2 years. The graphs covering\nall three years of the study indicate that 10 out\nof 13 schools (schools A, B, C, E, G, H, I, J, L,\n& M) receiving treatment experienced decreases\nin the cost of vandalism or maintained their very\nlow levels during intensive staff training. These\nincluded all the schools with vandalism greater\nthan $200/100 students in any month of baseline.\nTwo schools (schools D and K) showed\nincreases, and one school (school F) showed\nlittle change during intensive staff training.\nDuring the entire follow-up period, six of the 10\nschools remaining in the study maintained vandalism\ncost reductions (schools A, B, G, H, Iexcept\none month, & J), one increased (school\nF), and three showed little change (C, E, & M)\nfrom baseline. However, with inflation, costs\nwould be expected to increase over the 3-year\nperiod, not remain about the same. Thus, the\ntreatment package appears to have been effective\nin nine of the 10 schools.\nGenerally there is less vandalism from September\nthrough December than from January\nthrough May. This finding has been consistently\nborne out by data collected by the office of the\nLos Angeles County Superintendent of Schools.\nFor example, the average for all Los Angeles\nCounty Schools was $766,917/mo in vandalism\ncosts during September through December 1980,\nand $1,004,667/mo during January through\nMay 1981. Thus, when interpreting the graphed\ndata, it is best to compare treatment months back\nto the same nontreatment months.\nComparing the baseline period September\nthrough December with the same months during\ntreatment years shows the effect of treatment\nin reducing vandalism in Group I schools. A\nsimilar comparison can be made between the\nJanuary through May period for Group II\nschools. Thus, maximal reduction in vandalism\ncosts occurred following the onset of treatment\nin both experimental groups.\nTable 4 depicts a further analysis of the cost\ndata. The initial average mean cost during the\n1977 baseline period of September through December\nfor Group I schools was compared to\nthe same time periods during treatment for 1978\nand 1979. A similar comparison was done for\nGroup II schools. However, these schools had a\nmuch longer baseline and received treatment\nonly from January through May in 1979. Thus,\nthe 1978 January through May baseline for\n363\n364 G.

An average reduction in vandalism\ncost for all schools of 78.5 % was obtained\nwithout adjusting for inflation.\nTeacher Behavior\nDue to the large number of teachers involved\nin the study, behavior observations of a teacher\'s\ndelivery of praise were averaged. The mean\nof baseline observations was subtracted from the\nmean of posttreatment delivery of praise for\neach teacher for each year of the study.\nA 2 X 2 factorial analysis of variance (i.e.,\nelementary and junior high grade level by treatment\nand control groups) was used to analyze\nchanges in teacher praise between baseline and\ntreatment observations. The following is a brief\nsummary of the results that were found when\nteachers from Group I schools receiving treatment\nwere compared to teachers in Group II\ncontrol schools during 1977-1978.\n1977-1978. Project teachers in schools receiving\ntreatment significantly increased rates of\npraise by the interim assessment while improvement\nby barometer teachers in the same schools\nwas not significant until the posttreatment assessment\n(p < .05). Junior high school project\nand barometer teachers showed a significantly\ngreater mean increase in their delivery of praise\nthan that shown by elementary project teachers\n(p < .05). (The junior high school teachers\nstarted at a lower level than the elementary\nteachers.) Elementary barometer teachers in control\nschools not receiving treatment decreased\ntheir rate of delivering praise during the school\nyear significantly more than elementary teachers\nin schools receiving treatment (p < .05).\nThe following results were found when teachers\nfrom Groups I and II schools were compared\nto their control year (1977-1978):\n1978-1979. Teachers from project and barometer\nclassrooms showed a significantly greater\nincrease in their delivery of praise (p < .01).\nProject and barometer teachers attained significant\nincreases in delivery of praise by the interim\nassessment (p < .05) and rates continued\nto increase by the posttreatment assessment\n(p < .01).\n1979-1980. There was no significant effect of\nfollow-up treatment on the amount of praise delivered\nby teachers.\nStudent Behavior\nStudents were dropped from the analysis if\nthey were not present at least once during the\nbaseline and once during posttreatment data\ncollection periods. Disruptive behavior and nontask\nbehavior were combined and designated as\noff-task behavior-the reciprocal of attending\nbehavior. Baseline observations of off-task behavior\nwere averaged for each student. The\nmean of baseline observations was subtracted\nfrom the mean posttreatment off-task behavior\nfor each student for each year of the study. (No\nsignificant interim changes were noted.) The\nG. ROY MAYER et al.\nstudent was selected as the unit of analysis because\nanalysis of variance results are identical\n"irrespective of whether group means or individual\nobservations are employed. The use of\nindividual observations also allows the exploration\nof other interesting questions pertaining\nto interaction and generalizability" (Hopkins,\n1982, p. 5).\nA 2 X 2 factorial analysis of variance (school\nlevel by treatment) was used to evaluate changes\nin student off-task behavior between baseline and\nposttreatment observations. (A multiple baseline\ncomparison, though preferable, was deemed impractical\ndue to the limited number of observations\nand resources.)\nThe following results were found when students\nfrom schools receiving treatment were\ncompared to students in control schools during\n1977-1978: Students from project classrooms\nin schools receiving treatment showed a significantly\ngreater (p < .05) mean decrease in offtask\nbehavior during all 3 years of the study.\nThere was a significantly greater mean decrease\nin student off-task behavior for the elementary\nthan the junior high grades during 1977-1978\n(p < .05). Students from barometer classrooms\nin schools receiving treatment showed a significantly\ngreater (p < .05) mean decrease in\noff-task behavior during all 3 years of the\nstudy.\nDISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS\nStatistically significant reductions in vandalism\nwere obtained for two consecutive years. A\nmultiple baseline design also compared the\nvandalism costs of both treatment groups\nthroughout the 3-year duration of the study.\nBecause vandalism costs tend to be higher during\ncertain months than others, it is best to\ncompare treatment months back to nontreatment\nmonths in interpreting the graphed data. Recognizing\nthis, it can be seen that maximum vandalism\ncost reductions occurred only following\nimplementation of treatment in both groups.\nFurther, decreases from baseline, though somewhat\nsmaller, were obtained during the third\nyear, as shown in Table 4. These smaller decreases\nwere probably due to the double digit\ninflation that was occurring at the time.\nOff-task behavior (e.g., hitting, yelling, throwing\nobjects, not doing assigned work) of target\nstudents in both experimental project and barometer\nclassrooms decreased from baseline significantly\nmore than did the behavior of similar\nstudents in control project classrooms, throughout\neach of the 3 years of the study. Similarly,\nthe average rate of positive teacher-student contacts\nimproved significantly more in both the\nexperimental project and barometer classrooms\nthan in similar controls during the first 2 years\nof the study.\nThese findings are substantiated by a 1979\nsurvey of the teachers and principals who participated\nin the project. All team members were\ngiven a questionnaire and a structured interview\nwas conducted with team members. Fewer discipline\nproblems, greater cooperation, and more\npositive feelings among students and staff were\nreported to be a result of the project programs.\nThe survey was developed and completed by outside\nevaluators for the project and reported elsewhere\n(Jones, Mayer, & Butterworth, Note 7).\nThe present study indicates that the total\nschool climate might be affected by initially\nworking with the strong, influential members of\na school staff, while making some additional consultation\ncontacts with other staff members on\nrequest. Barometer teachers, a sample of other\nteachers in the school who did not attend offcampus\nworkshops, changed positively in the\nway they interacted with their students, giving\nstrong support to a schoolwide generalization of\nthese results. Unfortunately, records were not\nkept of how many barometer or other teachers\nrequested consultation. However, several reported\nevents indicated that numerous teachers\nwere influenced by the project teachers and other\nteam members. Project teachers shared materials\nwith other teachers and involved them in departmental\nor grade-level programs to provide students\npositive reinforcement for pro-social be-\n366\nSCHOOL VANDALISM AND DISCIPLINE\nhaviors. Some principals suggested to groups of\nstaff members and individuals that they try activities\nintroduced by the project staff. Principals\nalso praised project teachers at faculty meetings\nfor their participation in the project. During\nthe second year, consultants and school team\nmembers gave inservice training to all interested\nstaff members. Thus, the staff development\nmodel used in this study appears to be both\nfeasible and economical. It is difficult and often\neconomically impossible to provide workshops\nand frequent ongoing consultation services to\nall members of a staff.\nThe intervention was also cost-effective in another\nrespect. When average vandalism costs\nduring treatment were compared with baseline,\nreductions of 66-92% (mean = 78.5 %) were\nobtained without adjusting for inflation. These\nreductions occurred while schools throughout\nLos Angeles County were experiencing increases\nof 56% during 1978-1979 and 359% during\n1979-1980 (compared to the baseline year 1977-\n1978). When the data from Table 4 for the\n1978-1879 school year were averaged with the\npilot study data from 1976-1977 (Mayer & Butterworth,\n1979), a mean vandalism cost reduction\nof 73.5 % for 23 elementary and junior\nhigh schools was obtained. Thus, vandalism costs\nwithin project schools were reduced by at least\ntwo-thirds. A junior high school containing\n1,500 students with an average monthly vandalism\ncost of $121.35/100 students could potentially\nsave from $10,861 to $24,197 over a 9-\nmonth period. (The $10,861 figure is based\non the two-thirds decrease only, whereas the\n$24,197 figure is the estimated savings if the\nvandalism cost had increased 56% rather than\ndecreased 91.7 %.)\nSome bias could have entered into reports of\nvandalism by school principals. Principals might\nappear to be doing a better job if reported rates\nof vandalism were kept to a minimum. In actuality,\nit is quite unlikely that such biasing\noccurred. On the contrary, it is far more probable\nthat data on vandalism costs from the "treated"\nschools were biased in the other direction, because\nthe project staff visited those school sites\nweekly and reported any occurrences of damage\nthat they noted. These were added to those of the\nprincipals. Naturally, because staff were not\nvisiting the "control" schools at the same rate,\nsupplementary reports could not have been\nadded to the total figures. Thus, reported differences\nwould reflect an underestimate rather than\nan overestimate.\nStudent and teacher behaviors were assessed\nboth in target and in barometer classrooms to\nprovide assurance that changes were implemented\nand to probe for possible spread of effects\nwithin the schools. Financial and other\npractical considerations (e.g., training, supervision,\nfamiliarity with contingencies in the classroom)\nlimited the number of observations made\nand required that some of the observers also\nparticipate in the consultation during the first 2\nyears of the study. Thus, it is quite possible that\ntheir presence served to cue the teachers to practice\ntheir skills. However, only two of the six\nobservers consulted extensively with teachers.\nThese two did not collect data in the classroom.\nThe other four only consulted sporadically. The\nthree people who observed during the third\nyear had no history as consultants to any of the\nteachers. Further, the experimental data showing\nimproved student behavior also indicates that\nthe teachers\' performance probably did change.\nThus, any reactivity during that period of time\nwas probably no greater than that which is\nintegral to any applied situation in which the\nbehavior of the participants is under direct observation.\nNo one study, of course, provides a definitive\nanswer. The area of vandalism involves more\ncomplex and temporally distant behavior than\nthe immediate antecedents and consequences to\nbehavior emphasized in current applied behavior\nanalysis research (Wahler & Fox, 1981).\nFurther, any investigation that usese a treatment\npackage, or as broad an intervention program as\nwas used in this study, will have a number of\nproblems. Thus, this study should be viewed\nas a beginning ". . . an inspection of global\n367\n368 G. ROY MAYER et al.\ncategories . .. a reasonable first step in methodology"\n(Wahler & Fox, 1981, p. 332) pointing\nto a possible direction of future reserach.\nFor future research, many modifications could\nbe made in systematically replicating the present\nstudy. For example, even though it is almost impossible\nto measure directly the acts of vandalism,\nfuture investigation might attempt to assess\nthe reliability of vandalism cost and frequency\ndata by using two independent observers or reporters.\nAlso, some investigators may wish to\nexclude verified accidental property damage\nfrom their data. In the present study, it was not\npossible to separate out those data because the\nfigures were obtained from totals reported to the\nstate. More frequent classroom observations\ncould also supply more valid means of measuring\nteacher and pupil behavior, and permit independent\nobservers to verify the extent to which\nconsultants followed any standard procedure.\nBecause the treatment consisted of a "package"\nof procedures, it was impossible to determine\nto what degree classroom changes, planned\ncommunity activities, involvement of youth\nclubs, or other aspects of the project were responsible\nfor the obtained changes. Thus, further\nresearch should also attempt to tease out these\ndifferential contributors to the effectiveness of\nthe program. In particular, we would like to see\ninvestigations on the refinement and relative\ncontribution of various setting events.\nThe present study attempted to assess the\nenvironment, to determine whether it was becoming\nless punitive and more positive, by\nmeasuring rates of praise delivered by teachers.\nBehavior of other staff members (i.e., administrators)\nand interactions among peers could also\nbe measured. Degree of match between students\'\nreading levels and the difficulty of assigned materials\ncould be assessed and compared or correlated\nto frequency of vandalism and differential\ncosts. Similar investigations could be made with\nother potential setting events.\nThe present study and a previous one by\nMayer and Butterworth (1979) focused on just\na few factors that might provoke school disruption\nand vandalism. Because of the limited\nnumber of variables examined and the global\nmeasure of vandalism that was used, the magnitude\nof the results is impressive. The data solidly\nsupport the conclusion that educators can act\nsuccessfully to reduce vandalism and inappropriate\nstudent behavior. However, much more\nwork needs to be done to isolate effective treatment\nprograms. We may find that certain treatment\nprograms are best suited to preventing specific\ncategories of vandalism such as theft or\nproperty damage. Currently, we are attempting\nto see if aspects of this approach can be shown\nreliably to bring about similarly marked changes\nat the secondary school level. It is hoped that the\nconditions that contribute to vandalism within\nthe school can ultimately be identified and managed,\npermitting us then to direct our efforts to\nsome of the factors that influence vandalism\nfrom the outside.\nREFERENCE NOTES\n1.

aS'School vandalism: individual and social context.\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nSix hundred Israeli students responded to a questionnaire dealing with five motives for participating in vandalism: anger/frustration, boredom, erosion, aesthetics, and catharsis (Cohen, 1984). As we did not find a coherent pattern, we created a variable comprising all five motives: general motivation. Four factors accounted for motivation to participate in destructive behavior: perceived level of vandalism at school, attitude toward school, attitude toward teacher, and school anxiety. Punishment, father\'s level of education, sense of hope, and class level did not have an effect on motivation to participate in vandalism. It was concluded that the social context is a crucial element in school vandalism.\nVarious disciplines such as psychology and sociology have examined vandalism from different perspectives, and it is difficult to reach consensus on a definition. Nevertheless, some of the definitions have common elements, such as: "an intentional act aimed at damaging or destroying an object that is another\'s property" (Moser, 1992); "a voluntary degradation of the environment with no profit motive whatsoever, the results of which are considered damage by the actor(s) as well as the victim in relation to the norms that govern the situation" (Goldstein, 1996, p. 19); and "the willful or malicious destruction, injury, disfigurement, or defacement of property without the consent of the owner" (Casserly, Bass, & Garrett, 1982, p. 4). Most of the definitions highlight intentionality, destructiveness, and property ownership. This form of destructive behavior is thus motivated not by profit but by other factors. Cohen (1984) suggests that acts of vandalism are motivated by anger, boredom, catharsis, erosion of already damaged objects, or aesthetic factors.\nResearch on vandalism is divided into two categories. Some studies look at vandalism from the point of view of the individual who commits it: personal traits, difficulties in adjusting to society at large and to school in particular, and emotional problems. This perspective is derived mainly from epidemiological studies. Other studies look at vandalism in a broader social context. Research on vandalism as a social phenomenon began in the 1930s with ecological studies by the Chicago School. Vandalism was explained as a malaise of modern society that is characterized by alienation and meaninglessness. Zimbardo (1969) used the term deindividuation to describe a situation in which individuals lose their uniqueness. According to Zimbardo, the malaise of modern society is related to a high level of social mobility, rapid growth, and instability. Erikson looked at modern society from the point of view of adolescents who experience social mores and values inconsistently and therefore become involved in nonnormative behavior.\nAccording to Casserly, Bass, and Garrett (1982), the social explanations of vandalism until the 1970s were too amorphous and unfocused; consequently, their explanatory power was limited. A new line of explanations began to look at specific institutions, one of them being school. Pioneering research on school violence and school vandalism--the Safe School Study--was conducted in the mid-1970s (U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare, 1978). The study, carried out in approximately 25,000 schools throughout the United States, examined objective parameters as well as subjective ones (i.e., students\' perceptions). The objective parameters found to have an effect on school vandalism were school size, age of the student population, teacher turnover, and parental support for the school\'s discipline policy. The salient subjective parameters were the students\' views of how their teachers function (e.g., how fair they are, whether they use grades to exert power over students) and whether school rules are unambiguous (U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare, 1978).\nFollowing this major study, research was conducted that focused on the connection between vandalism and school effectiveness and climate. It was found that when school climate was not positive and did not enhance students\' social welfare, the rate of vandalism was high, and when the school did not effectively promote learning, vandalism tended to increase (Zeisel, 1977). It was also found that vandalism increased in schools where students did not have a sense of belonging.\nSome researchers have emphasized teacher-student interaction as a causal variable (Heller & White, 1975). Others have noted that tolerance, respect for others, and motivation to achieve are important in mitigating vandalism (Dust, 1984; Geller, 1992). In an Israeli study, Horowitz and Amir (1981) found that students who were involved in vandalism were socially marginal at school; they felt alienated from school and were low achievers though not necessarily low in terms of competence.\nMETHOD\nThe present study on vandalism was carried out in 1999 in four high schools in a medium-sized Israeli town. The students in these schools were representative of the social composition of Israel. The research question was as follows: What factors influence destructive behavior by students toward school property? Specifically, is motivation to participate in vandalism related to personal background, perception of school as an institution, attitude toward teacher, school anxiety, sense of hope, perception of school climate, and how discipline is applied?\nSix hundred eighth and ninth graders responded to the questionnaire, which had six sections. The first section dealt with attitudes toward school and toward the homeroom teacher. Both subscales were adapted from Epstein and McPartland\'s (1976) instrument: Quality of Life at School. The statements on the first subscale--attitude toward school--to which the students were asked to respond were: I do not like to go to school; I am happy at school; I would be happier if I attended a different school; there is nothing to change in my school; I would leave my school if I could; there are a lot of interesting events in my school. The reliability (alpha) of this subscale was .60. The statements on the second subscale--attitude toward homeroom teacher --were: our homeroom teacher takes care of our problems; our homeroom teacher consults with us on matters concerning our class; outside class the teacher is like us; the teacher\'s lessons on current affairs are very interesting. The reliability (alpha) of this subscale was .64.\nThe second section of the questionnaire consisted of a scale, developed previously (see Horowitz & Amir, 1981), about school anxiety. The items in the scale were: Do you get excited when the teacher tests your knowledge on subjects he/she taught? When you read something to your class, do you get confused about material that you know? When the teacher calls on you, are you embarrassed? When you sit at home thinking about tomorrow\'s class, are you afraid that you will not do well in it? Are you afraid of school tests? When you take a test, do you think you will fail? Does your hand shake when you take a test? The reliability (alpha) of this scale was .71.\nThe third section was the Index of Hope (Stat & Stassen, 1985). The question asked was: What do you think will happen to you next year? The students had to respond to the following statements: I will do well in school; I will have more friends; I will manage to do what I like; I will be cheerful; I will have free time; my family will understand me; I will have the freedom to do what I like. The reliability (alpha) of this scale was .77.\nThe fourth section dealt with perception of level of vandalism at school. The items on the scale, developed by Horowitz, were: in my school, students like to stick chewing gum under their seats; students throw the shavings onto the floor after sharpening their pencils; students throw used paper on the floor; most of the students carve their names on their desks and draw on the classroom walls; if there is a hole in the door, students will widen it. The reliability (alpha) of this scale was .72.\nThe fifth section dealt with active participation in vandalism in the last three months and the motives for participating in acts of vandalism. Each item represented a different motive based on Cohen\'s (1984) typology: sometimes out of anger I destroy school property (frustration motive); at times I have destroyed school property because I was bored (boredom motive); when I see damaged property, I destroy it further (erosion motive); sometimes I destroy property because I want to express my emotions (catharsis motive); when I draw on the wall, I feel creative (aesthetic or creativity motive).\nThe sixth section of the questionnaire dealt with the effectiveness of punishment. The students were asked to state how effective different types of punishment are: financial penalties, such as paying for the damaged property; educational penalties, such as working with handicapped students; notifying parents; collective punishment of the class; and publicizing the names of destructive students.\nRESULTS\nWe first wanted to determine whether different motives to participate in acts of vandalism (i.e., frustration, boredom, erosion, aesthetics, and catharsis) are influenced by different factors, and multiple regression was used to analyze the data. Each motive was considered separately as the dependent variable, and the independent variables were: father\'s level of education; class level; attitude toward school; attitude toward homeroom teacher; school anxiety; hope index; perceived level of vandalism at school; and punishment policy, which included financial penalties, educational penalties, notifying parents, collective punishment of the class, and publicizing the names of destructive students. Five regression analyses were employed, in accordance with the five motives (see Tables 1 to 5). In four of the five regression analyses, the independent variable that contributed most to the dependent variable was the perceived level of vandalism at school. In three of the five regression analyses, attitude toward school helped explain motivation to participate in vandalism. In two regression analyses, school anxiety and attitude toward homeroom teacher made a significant contribution to motivation to participate in vandalism. The following variables did not make a significant contribution: father\'s level of education, class level, hope index, and punishment.\nOn the whole, we did not find a coherent pattern of explanatory factors for the different motives. In addition, R\xc2\xb2 was quite small in each case. Consequently, we created a variable comprising all five motives: general motivation to participate in an act of destruction. The reliability (alpha) of "general motivation" was .80.\nA regression analysis was performed with general motivation as the dependent variable and the same independent variables as in the previous analyses (R\xc2\xb2 = 19.3). Four factors made a significant contribution to motivation to participate in acts of vandalism: perceived level of vandalism at school (beta = .341), attitude toward school (beta = .166), attitude toward homeroom teacher (beta = .127), and school anxiety (beta = .127). The following variables did not make a significant contribution: father\'s level of education, punishment, hope index, and class level (see Table 6).\nDISCUSSION\nThese findings are compatible with Goldstein\'s (1996) argument that setting (or context) has strong explanatory power: "Schools are a prime ecological context for vandalism, not only due to the presence of a large number of youths at a highly vandalism-prone age, the personal component, but also because of several real and symbolic qualities of the school itself, the environmental component" (pp. 28-29). This study is also in accord with the Safe School Study (U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare, 1978) and research by Horowitz and Amir (1981), which showed that vandalism and violence are not limited to poverty-stricken areas and children from low socioeconomic circumstances, but also occur in middle-class areas with more affluent students. For example, social class and age (i.e., father\'s level of education and student\'s class level), two personal (individual) factors investigated in the present study, did not have significant effects on motivation to participate in acts of vandalism. In contrast, level of vandalism at school had a strong impact on motivation to participate in vandalism.\nWe can look at the results from the perspective of learning theory. If the perceived norm is that of destructive behavior, then the individual will more likely behave according to that dominant norm and engage in vandalism. Frustration may also play a role. We found that attitudes toward school and teachers, and anxiety as a result of experiences at school, were associated with motivation to participate in acts of vandalism.\nIt was also found that punishment had no effect on motivation to participate in vandalism. Punishment--a show of strength--is the instinctive reaction to vandalism, but studies have indicated that various punishments are ineffective because they are "person-oriented" rather than "context-oriented" (Heller & White, 1975; Stoner et al., 1991; Goldstein, 1996). Some researchers have even argued that punishment provokes vandalism.\nIn conclusion, the social context is a key element in adolescent vandalism. When the school climate is supportive and encourages teamwork, and students find that schooling is related to their lives and can advance their goals, and the school defines norms and rules such that students feel the system is fair, vandalism is less likely to occur (Casserly, Bass, & Garrett, 1982).\nReprint requests should be sent to Tamar Horowitz, Department of Education, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, P.O.B. 653, Beer Sheva, 84105, Israel.

aS'Student Vandalism and Public Schools: The Scope of the Illinois Educators\' Directive to Discipline\n\nDONALD SHAWLER*\nI. INTRODUCTION\nFour days prior to the outset of summer vacation, a break in\noccurred at the Thomas middle school. Unnamed student suspects,\nupset at being excluded from the yearly field trip, pried two plexiglass\nwindows off their frames to gain access inside the school. The\nstudents, ages eleven and thirteen, vandalized the entire building.\nUpon entering the classroom, the vandals overturned desks,\nscattered textbooks, urinated on the floor, and ignited a roll of paper\ntowels; an adjoining library was similarly wrecked. Continuing their\nsiege, the culprits discharged dry-cell fire extinguishers in the hallway,\nsmashed pint-sized milk cartons against the kitchen wall, and emptied\ntwo large boxes of vegetables on the floor. Damage to the institution\ntotaled $300.\nMembers of the school board, still uncertain of their rights and\nresponsibilities after consulting counsel, opposed any disciplinary\nmeasures against the students.1\nII. OVERVIEW\nThe situation is common. Across the country, officials answerable\nfor secondary education are continually frustrated by pupils\' malicious\ndestruction and theft of school property.2 According to an annual\nGallup Poll, lack of student discipline is consistently ranked the\n* B.S. cum laude 1983, University of Illinois; J.D. magna cum laude 1986,\nSouthern Illinois University.

Estimates have ranged from $200 to $600 million annually.4\nThe lower end, however, has been criticized as "grossly understated,"\nas it fails to account for the price of increasing insurance rates and\nsecurity.\' Broken down, a $500 million bill represents approximately\n$10 per student a year, or $55,000 per school district. 6 This loss could\nfinance for an entire year a school breakfast program designed to\nfeed 133 children.7\nAmong vandals favorite escapades are breaking windows and\nsetting fires. Every month, students commit 2400 acts of arson in\npublic institutions.8 A large district could buy a new school with the\nmoney it spends each year replacing windows. 9 Some youth simply\nwill not be outdone. Reports abound of their blowing apart toilets\nwith cherry bombs,\'0 or leaving bunsen burners ignited in a laboratory\nand turning on the gas jets hoping that the room might eventually\nexplode." Schools reportedly consume the vandalism dollar as follows:\n1) fire damage-39.6 cents, 2) glass breakage-25.4 cents, 3) property\ndestruction-19.6 cents, and 4) equipment theft-15.4 cents.\' 2\n3.

Consequently, school boards\nand administrators, especially at the secondary level, must exercise\nbroad authority to punish wrongdoers and a fortiori preserve that\nsystem which is the linchpin of American society.\nThis article will focus on the ability of instructional policymakers\nand implementers to act decisively against student vandals, free from\nthe fear that courts will second-guess their sound discretion. Since\nofficials generally prefer suspension or expulsion for egregious conduct\nsuch as vandalism, leaving corporeal punishment to correct\nclassroom misbehavior, the legal ramifications of the former options\nwill be emphasized. 7 Following a brief summary of school discipline\'s\ndevelopment, the focus turns to a discussion of the federal constitutional\nstandards by which all public educators are bound. Illinois\nlawmakers\' treatment of the relevant issues will then be considered.\n13. ILLINOIS OFFICE OF EDUC., DEPT.

Expulsion, on the other hand, is a\nfunction of the school board and concerns a much longer period. Lawmakers have\nnot yet defined what exact time frames constitute either of the two measures.

IN Loco PARENTIS\nPrior to free public education"8 and compulsory attendance laws, 9\ninstructors possessed virtually unlimited authority to discipline their\npupils provided the punishment at least tenuously related to the wellbeing\nof the class.20 Such control arose from the concept of in loco\nparentis-the idea that the master acted as a parent in chastising the\nstudent. 2\' As Blackstone first stated in his Commentaries:\n[The parent] may also delegate part of his parental authority\n.. . to the tutor or schoolmaster of his child; who is then in\nloco parentis, and has such a portion of the power of the\nparent committed to his charge, viz, that of restraint and\ncorrection, as may be necessary to answer the purposes for\nwhich he is employed. 22\nIn the United States, this precept was initially construed to mean\nthat unless a teacher inflicted permanent physical injury upon the\nchild motivated by malice, courts would presume his judgment correct.\n23 But eventually, judges realized the unfairness of this approach,\n18. See ILL. CONST. art. X, \xc2\xa7 1 (education in public schools through the\nsecondary level shall be free).\n19. See ILL. REV. STAT. ch. 122, para. 26-1 (1987) (education is mandatory\nbetween the ages of 7 and 16).\n20. Mawdsley, In Loco Parentis: A Balancing of Interests, 61 ILL. B.J. 638\n(1973); H. HUDGINS & R.

STAT.\nch. 122, paras. 24-24, 34-84a (1987) (paragraph 24-24 applies to cities with a population of less than 500,000 and paragraph 34-84a applies to cities with a\npopulation greater than 500,000): "Teachers and other certificated educational em- ployees shall maintain discipline in the schools .... In all matters relating to the\ndiscipline in and conduct of the schools and the school children, they stand in the\nrelation of parents and guardians to the pupils.. . ." See Kobylanski v. Chicago Bd.\nof Educ., 63 111. 2d 165, 170, 347 N.E.2d 705, 707-08 (1976).\n22. SPRAGUE, ABRIDGMENT OF BLACKSTONE\'S COMMENTARIES 83 (1893).\n23. See, e.g., State v. Pendergrass, 19 N.C.

Burt, 0 a student\'s suit against school directors for\ndamages arising from a purportedly improper suspension, the Illinois\nSupreme Court stated the general rule: "It is not enough to aver the\naction of such officers was erroneous, but it must be averred and\nexcess, some barbarity. In our schools in England many boys have been\nmaimed, yet I never heard of an action against a schoolmaster on that\naccount.\nBoyd v. State, 88 Ala. 169, 173, 7 So. 268, 270 (1890) (quoting 2 BOSWELL, BOSWELL\'s\nLIFE OF JOHNSON 89-96 (1772)).\n24. See, e.g., Lander v. Seaver, 32 Vt. 114, 123-24 (1859).\n25.

VOORHESS, THE LAW OF THE PUBLIC\nSCHOOL SYSTEM OF THE UNITED STATES 166-95 (1916).\nBecause of the state courts\' construction of the in loco parentis doctrine, even\ntoday in Illinois a student must prove that a teacher acted in a wilful and wanton\nmanner before civil liability will be imposed for an unjustified paddling. Holt v.\nCross, 121 Ill. App. 3d 695, 696, 460 N.E.2d 8, 9 (5th Dist. 1983); Baikie v. Luther\nHigh School S., 51 111. App. 3d 405, 408-09, 366 N.E.2d 542, 545 (1st Dist. 1977);\nGordon v.

CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITATIONS\nOver the past twenty years, courts have clarified substantially the\nconstitutional minima with which public schools must comport in\ndetermining whether to exclude a student? 4 Since the Supreme Court\nof the United States\' 1969 declaration in Tinker v. Des Moines School\nDistrict that students do not shed their constitutional rights at the\nschoolhouse gate,35 federal forums have addressed a bevy of complaints\nalleging unlawful exclusion from the classroom.3 6 That pupils\n31.

I11. 1976) (in loco\nparentis authority of school officials cannot transcend students\' constitutional rights).\n34. As state officials, the overseers of public education are unquestionably\nsubject to constitutional restraints. See e.g., Tarter v. Raybuck, 742 F.2d 977, 981\n(6th Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1051 (1985).\n35. 393 U.S. 503, 506, 511 (1969). In Tinker, three students who wore black\narmbands to school in protest of the Vietnam conflict were suspended for violating\na written policy against such activity. Characterizing the armbands as a form of\nsymbolic speech protected by the first amendment, the Court held the prohibition\ncould not be sustained where the record failed to show that the students\' conduct\nmight substantially disrupt school activities. Tinker v. Des Moines School Dist., 393\nU.S. 503, 509 (1969).\nA discussion of how first amendment considerations might affect educators\'\njudgment in disciplinary proceedings is outside the present subject matter\'s domain.\nSee generally Annotation, First Amendment Rights of Free Speech and Press As\nApplied to Public Schools-Supreme Court Cases, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1466 (1987). An\nargument that acts of vandalism constitute symbolic speech is indefensible. Actions\nwhich interfere with the maintenance of proper discipline in the operation of the\nschool have never been accorded constitutional protection. See Bethel School Dist.\nv. Fraser, 478 U.S. 675, 685 (1986); Tinker, 393 U.S. at 509, 513. Compare Hazelwood\nSchool Dist. v. Kuhlmeier, 108 S. Ct. 562, 569 (1988) (question of whether first\namendment compels authorities to tolerate particular student speech as decided in\nTinker differs from question of whether Constitution requires them to condone\ncontent of school-sponsored publication).\n36.

PROCEDURAL DUE PROCESS\nA few state courts, as early as the late 1800\'s, recognized as a\nmatter of common law a school official\'s duty to provide a suspended\nchild with a hearing.37 In 1887, a Pennsylvania county court ruled a\npublic institution could not justify expelling a student without giving\nhim a fair chance to rebut the accusations against him by confronting\nwitnesses." But this was not the general rule in Illinois39 or elsewhere. 4\n0\nIllinois decisions apparently required nothing more than the authorities\'\nconsideration of "some evidence" in connection with the incident.\n41 Not until the Fifth Circuit\'s 1961 ruling in Dixon v. Alabama\nState Board of Education did a federal court recognize the student\'s\nright to a hearing as constitutionally mandated. 42\nofficial:\nEvery person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom\nor usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or\ncauses to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person\nwithin the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges,\nor immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the\nparty injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding\nfor redress.\n42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983 (1982).\n37.

Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U.S. 651, 672-78 (1977), held that while\ncorporeal punishment in public schools implicates constitutionally protected liberty\ninterests, common law remedies are fully adequate to afford due process in view of\n1988:871\nNORTHERN ILLINOIS UNIVERSITY LA W REVIEW\nDixon arose when black students of the Alabama State College\nwere expelled without a hearing for engaging in civil rights demonstrations\nand protests. The students claimed they were arbitrarily\ndeprived of their right to public education without due process of\nlaw, and the appellate court agreed. Due process required notice and\nsome opportunity to be heard before the students of a state institution\ncould be disciplined for misconduct. 43\nThe Supreme Court subsequently left no doubt as to the necessity\nof procedural safeguards for a public school student facing suspension\nor expulsion when it decided Goss v. Lopez." Reasoning that state\nfree public education and mandatory attendance laws created a legitimate\nclaim of entitlement to secondary instruction, and hence a\nprotectable property interest under the fourteenth amendment, Justice\nWhite for the majority believed the prerogative of educators to\nmaintain order in the schools, while broad, was not unlimited: "At\nthe very minimum . . . students facing suspension and the consequent\ninterference with a protected property interest must be given some\nkind of notice and afforded some kind of hearing. \' 45\nIn considering a suspension of ten days, the Court held that nine\nstudents charged with various misdeeds within the Ohio public school\nsystem, one of which was the destruction of property, 46 were at least\nentitled to oral notice of the complaint against them and, if they\ndenied it, an explanation of the evidence and a chance to present their\nrespective stories. While the process due could immediately follow the\nmisconduct, the students could be removed prior to rudimentary\nhearing only if they exhibited a continuing imminent danger to the\nacademic process. To prevent the diversion of educational resources,\nthe Court stopped short of affording the accused the full scale\nprotections of a criminal trial. It noted, however, that a longer\ncompeting educational concerns.

The due process clause likewise\ndoes not require an opportunity to appeal.5 9\nAs will be discussed, courts, absent a prejudicial procedural\ndefect, will almost always sustain a decision to suspend or expel an\nunruly student if some evidence exists to support the school officials\'\nconclusion. 6\n0 Even if the student admits guilt, however, due process\nmay still contemplate a hearing on the question of what discipline is\nwarranted for the misconduct. In Betts v. Board of Education of\nChicago,6\n\' a high school sophomore confessed to sounding false fire\nalarms, and was forced to transfer. Although acknowledging her\nadmission negated the need for any factual determination, the Seventh\nCircuit Court of Appeals nevertheless established that where a penalty\n"tantamount to expulsion" is involved, officials must give the pupil\nan opportunity to present a mitigative argument. 62\nDetermining the "process due" in every instance is not a simple\ntask. The test of whether a student has received procedural due\nprocess is one of "fundamental fairness in the light of the total\ncircumstances."63 The Supreme Court per Justice Brandeis established\nlong ago that "a hearing granted does not cease to be fair, merely\nbecause rules of evidence and of procedure applicable in judicial proceedings have not been strictly followed ... or because some\nevidence has been improperly rejected or received."64 A transgression\nof procedural due process occurs only where the defects in the hearing\nresult in substantial prejudice to the aggrieved party. 65\n763, 770 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1027 (1972).

The severity of the proposed\nsanction determines the validity of the process used. 66 School boards\nand administrators would be wise to provide the suspect prompt\nwritten notice and ample time to prepare in every instance where\nexpulsion is a possibility. Although they have no power to subpoena\nwitnesses, officials should also allow free confrontation of those\nwilling to testify. Some courts have recognized that a student facing\nexpulsion should be allowed to confront those having knowledge of\nthe relevant facts. 67 Others have found a right of the accused to\ncounsel. 6\n1\nGoss v. Lopez teaches that the desire for certain procedures must\nbe balanced against the potential impediment to the educational\natmosphere: "To impose in each such case even truncated trial-type\nprocedures might well overwhelm administrative facilities in many\nplaces and, by diverting resources, cost more than it would save in\neducational effectiveness.

Admittedly, there\nmust be some reasonable and constitutional ground for expulsion or\nthe courts would have a duty to require reinstatement.\'"\' Whether\nschool officials\' decision to suspend or expel a student will be considered\narbitrary has come to depend principally upon two questions: 1) Did the accused have adequate notice that the misconduct might\njustify disciplinary sanctions? 2) Is the penalty so disproportionate to\nthe offense as to bear no rational relationship to a legitimate end?\n1. Fair Warning\nThe rule that individuals must be given some warning of improper behavior before they may be penalized for so acting is fundamental\nto due process. 72 The reason is two-fold. First, a person of ordinary intelligence must be able to understand what conduct is forbidden so\nthat he or she can freely decide whether to engage in certain activity."\nSecond, laws which provide indefinite standards may foster arbitrary enforcement by public officials. 74 A statute or regulation which forbids\nan act "in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must\nnecessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application, violates\nthe first essential of due process of law." \' 75 Courts will declare penal laws subject to many interpretations void for vagueness. 76 This precept\nwas the basis for a student\'s challenge to paragraph 10-22.6(a) of the\nIllinois School Code-the provision empowering a school board "[tjo\nexpel pupils guilty of gross disobedience or misconduct. \'\n"77\nIn Whitfield v.

Only if the law was unfairly\napplied would the court intervene.\nRelying on the Seventh Circuit\'s earlier decision in Soglin v.\nKauffman, 3 Circuit Judge Cummings dissented, arguing paragraph\n10-22.6(a) failed to supply the clear and narrow standards required\nby due process.8 4 In Soglin, the court held that University of Wisconsin\nofficials\' allegations of "misconduct" against students who openly\nprotested the on-campus presence of recruiters from Dow Chemical\ncould not pass constitutional muster. Because the university made no\nreference to any preexisting rule which supplied a fair guide for the\naccused, their actions could not serve as the basis for their expulsion.\nThe disciplinary standard of "misconduct," without more, fell for\nvagueness. 5 Judge Cummings could not distinguish Soglin-something\nthe majority had not attempted to do.\nThe Seventh Circuit subsequently adopted Judge Cummings\' view\nand rejected Whitfield in Linwood v. Board of Education of Peoria16\nwhen, in order to sustain the statute\'s validity, the court construed it\nas a grant of power to school officials enabling them to formulate\nspecific standards of conduct. The board expelled Linwood after\nfinding him responsible for striking other students at school. The high\nschool\'s student code expressly defined physical assault as behavior\nworthy of suspension or expulsion. The court held that paragraph 10-\n22.6 was not void as a vague proscription of student activity but was\nto be "implemented by appropriate rules adopted by the local school\n80. See ILL. REV.

A pupil committing an offense egregious\nby any standard has no standing to claim a lack of fair warning."\nIn view of Linwood, school authorities are well advised to enact\na body of clear and specific guidelines to govern student behavior.\nGiven the authorities\' need to impose sanctions for a wide range of\nunanticipated conduct disruptive of the educational process, school\ndisciplinary rules certainly do not require the detail of criminal laws. 9\nBut a code of student conduct, complete with a list of possible\nsanctions for its contravention, not only will prevent due process\ncontests on the basis of inadequate warning, but also will assist\nfunctionaries in reaching a prompt decision on the merits of each\ncase.\nAs Linwood indicated, officials\' hands are not tied for want of\na written rule if the offense violates accepted standards of behavior\nand is truly gross. Courts do not wish to inhibit educators in facing\na problem of discipline simply because there is no preexisting rule on\nthe books. 9\xc2\xb0 A judge would be hard pressed to accept vandals\'\nassertions that they had insufficient notice of their crime\'s consequences.\nBut school officials must remember to specifically inform\nstudents when conduct arguably warranting disciplinary measures will\nactually justify such penalties. 9\n\'\n2.

It is not the role of federal\ncourts to set aside decisions of school administrators which\nthe court may view as lacking a basis in wisdom or compassion.\nPublic high school students do have substantive and procedural\nrights while at school. But \xc2\xa7 1983 does not extend the right to\nrelitigate in federal court evidentiary questions arising in school\ndisciplinary proceedings or the proper construction of school\nregulations. The system of public education that has evolved\nin the Nation relies necessarily upon the discretion and judgment\nof school administrators and school board members, and\n\xc2\xa7 1983 was not intended to be a vehicle for federal court\ncorrections of errors in the exercise of that discretion which\ndo not rise to the level of violations of specific constitutional\nguarantees .9\nAssuming therefore that educators will not act arbitrarily and impose\npunishment where literally no evidence exists to support guilt, 95 or\ninterpret their rules in a way with which no reasonable person could\nagree, 96 courts will strike down a sanction only if it is not rationally\nrelated to the objective of providing an orderly and effective learning\natmosphere. 9\nPerhaps the leading case finding no rational relationship between\na student\'s offense and the selected punishment is Cook v.

Absent extenuating circumstances, courts permit\neducational authorities to exercise wide discretion in passing judgment.\'\n\xc2\xb0\n0 One judge aptly stated: "For the Court to inject itself into\nthe manner in which school administrators wish to discipline school\nchildren would constitute a significant intrusion by the Court into an\narea of primary educational responsibility.\'"0\nOfficials may even discipline a pupil for improper behavior\noccurring off school premises if a sufficient nexus exists between the\nmisdeed and the pedagogical process.1 02 For instance, in Caldwell v.\nCannady\'0 the district court sustained the expulsion of students for\npossessing marijuana off school grounds and after school hours.\nAlthough characterizing the scope of educators\' authority to discipline\nas a "troublesome issue," the court reasoned that because student\ndrug use might adversely affect the educational environment, a rule\nwhich forbid such activity was a reasonable exercise of the school\nboard\'s discretion. 104\nIn determining whether authorities lawfully disciplined a student\nfor misconduct, courts place primary emphasis upon the punishment\'s\nreasonableness in light of the general welfare and best interests of the\nschool.

ILLINOIS LAW\nUnder the state constitution, the General Assembly has plenary\nauthority, albeit implicit, to establish a system of student conduct in\nIllinois. 10 7 The legislature, in turn, has deemed it appropriate to\ndelegate that prerogative to those presumably better able to determine\nthe specific needs of public education. The provisions of the Illinois\nSchool Code\'0 concerning discipline are broadly worded, granting\nschool boards the power to promulgate specific rules and regulations\nfor their districts. As a result, educators are necessarily given much\ndiscretion in enacting reasonable guidelines by which to maintain\norder in the schools.\nThe Code contains two provisions relating to the suspension and\nexpulsion of public school pupils. As previously discussed, paragraph\n10-22.6 permits authorities to exclude students guilty of "gross disobedience\nor misconduct."\'\xc2\xb09 While only the board can expel an unruly\n106. At this point, it is proper to note that school officials sued individually for\ndamages due to a student\'s purported constitutional deprivation may assert the\naffirmative defense of qualified immunity. This shield, designed to provide public\nofficers freedom to perform their duties without the fear of harassing litigation and\nmonetary liability, applies if the functionaries in disciplining a student did not violate\n"clearly established" constitutional rights:\n[Wlhether an official protected by qualified immunity may be held\npersonally liable for an allegedly unlawful action generally turns on the\n"objective legal reasonableness" of the action, assessed in light of the legal\nrules that were "clearly established" at the time it was taken....\nThe contours of the [pupil\'s] right must be sufficiently clear that a\nreasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that\nright.\nAnderson v.

Because\nmost acts of vandalism occur after school or on the weekends, 3\' few\nreported cases address the problem. Those decisions discussing the\noffense, however, leave no doubt that excluding the culprits from the\nclassroom promotes the school district\'s legitimate interest in preserving\nthe system.3 2\nAn example is the Mississippi Supreme Court\'s recent opinion in\nClinton Municipal Separate School District v.

Panhandle Community Unit School District140 recently ruled\nthat such a sanction, while lacking compassion, does not alone raise\nproblems of constitutional proportions.\nIn Lamb, the principal suspended the plaintiff, a senior in high\nschool, for the final three days of the school year after the student\nadmitted drinking whiskey on a class outing. Consequently, Lamb\nmissed final exams and was unable to graduate due to failing grades.\nAffirming the dismissal of the complaint, the court of appeals agreed\nwith the district court that "a different disposition . . . might have\nbeen worked out because of the timing. \' \' 14\n\' Nonetheless, the court\nrealized the question was not whether it agreed with the principal\'s\ndecision, but only whether he had abused his discretion in so acting.\nThe court felt he had not.\nA more difficult question concerns the legality of a suspension\nor expulsion to begin at the onset of the fall semester. The Office of\nthe Illinois Attorney General believes a school board may not expel a\nstudent for more than the remaining academic year.1 42 Its position,\nhowever, relies solely on dicta from an 1889 decision of the Illinois\nAppellate Court. In Board of Education v. Helston,\'43 a fourteen year\nold boy was indefinitely suspended from school in November for\nrefusing to give authorities the name of another pupil who apparently\nwrote obscenities on the schoolhouse. The trial judge ordered the\nchild reinstated and adjudged costs against the board. On appeal, the\nThird District reversed only the award of costs. Because the school\nyear in which the plaintiff was suspended had ended, the court\npresumed he was no longer "debarred of school privileges." 1" Therefore,\nthe question of his reinstatement was moot.\nPerhaps where a student has already served a lengthy expulsion,\nas did Helston, extending the punishment into the fall term would be\ndeemed arbitrary. The severity of the sanction must be commensurate\n140. 826 F.2d 526 (7th Cir. 1987).\n141. Lamb v. Panhandle Community Unit School Dist., 826 F.2d 526, 530 (7th\nCir. 1987).\n142. 1974 Op.

This suspension would not be construed to continue beyond the\nschool year then current, and as that year has now expired the relator\npresumably is not now debarred of school privileges.

But the Attorney General\'s opinion\ndoes not account for the situation where the misconduct occurs\nimmediately prior to or during summer vacation. No court has decided\nthe due process ramifications of that issue, and the few commentators\nwho have mentioned the problem disagree. 145\nVandalism threatens to impede the educational process at all\ntimes. School authorities have a responsibility not only to deter\npotential offenders, but also to preserve the facilities which are so\ngermane to a quality education. 146 While courts must ensure that\nofficials afford student vandals procedural and substantive guarantees,\nthey cannot reasonably force educators to withhold punishment until\nthe school is destroyed. Must authorities wait until vandals burn down\nthe schoolhouse during summer vacation to safely conclude that the\neducational process has been disrupted and that the perpetrators may\nbe excluded from the classroom? Surely not.\nVII. CONCLUSION\nThe education of our nation\'s youth is not the responsibility of\njudges, but of parents, teachers and school officials. When properly\ninformed of student\'s rights, Illinois educators may fulfill their duty\nto maintain good order in the schools confident that their actions\ncomply with the Constitution and will not be disturbed by the courts.\nThe prompt correction of student vandals is necessary to discourage\nfurther misrule. There is no place for hesitancy in confronting a\nproblem which costs taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars each\nyear. The words of a nineteenth century Illinois Appellate Court ring\ntrue today: "It need not be argued that the defacement of a public\nschool building . . . is an intolerable offense and that the most radical\nmeasures should be resorted to, if necessary, to prevent a repetition\nof it."\'147\n145.

aS'The genesis of vandalism: From childhood to adolescence\n\n\n\n\nIrina V. Vorobyeva, Olga V. Kruzhkova*\n, Marina S. Krivoshchekova\nUral State Pedagogical University, Ekaterinburg, Russia\n*Corresponding author. E-mail: galiat1@yandex.ru\nThis study was developed because vandal behavior is an increasing threat in the world.\nCountries, commercial companies, and individuals experience great damage to property\nas a result of individual vandal acts. In addition, vandalism threatens not only \xe2\x80\x9ctangible\nassets\xe2\x80\x9d but also the cultural and historical heritage of modern humanity. Despite\nthe threatening spread of vandalism, the study of its psychological foundations, including\nits origins, in the context of individual life courses is in many ways terra incognita.\nThe objective of the present study was to investigate the genesis of vandal behavior and\nthe sociopsychological and individual personality factors in the formation of readiness\nto destroy public property and the property of others. A comprehensive study of\nchildren, adolescents, and young adults (N=1522), as well as of their social environment,\nrevealed mechanisms of the readiness to commit vandal acts that were present\nsince childhood. The study was conducted by examining four age groups: preschoolers\n(4\xe2\x80\x936 years), primary school pupils (7\xe2\x80\x939 years), adolescents (12\xe2\x80\x9315 years), and young\nadults (17\xe2\x80\x9322 years); the instruments used were specific-age batteries, observation, expert\ntechniques, and questionnaires. We found that the characteristics of parent-child\nrelationship are is the basis for forming the boundaries of the permissible activity of the\nchild; disturbance in the parent-child relationship can lead to the development of forms\nof vandalism in children. We describe the specificity and intensity of the vandal activity\nof adolescents and young adults in the context of their environment, and we look\nat the individual characteristics that promote deviant behavior. Thus, vandal activity is\nnot only a specific characteristic of adolescents and young adults, and it is not always\nvery destructive. Basic vandal activity originates in the early stages of ontogenesis as a\nresult of a deformation in social interaction that becomes fixed and converted into the\ndestructive actions of people trying through this form of activity to understand themselves\nin social space.\nKeywords: vandalism, genesis of vandal behavior, preschool age, primary school age,\nadolescence, youth, personality and environmental factors in the development of vandal\nbehavior\n140 I. V. Vorobyeva, O. V. Kruzhkova, M. S. Krivoshchekova\nIntroduction\nHuman beings are the only creatures on the planet who consciously and deliberately\nalter the space around them. As a result of human activity the made environment\nis created. But the desire for change does not end with creating this environment;\npeople continue to change it: they do not accept the fact that it is already given as\na result of others\xe2\x80\x99 actions. By itself, the transformation of the environment can be\nboth socially approved and socially disapproved \xe2\x80\x94 that is, of a vandal character.\nWhat is the reason for this particular type of activity, its deep motivation, its basic\nrequirements?\nOn the one hand, this activity can be regarded as the result of an attempt to\ntransform, create, innovate, or change, or to provide social or spiritual benefits to\noneself or other people. On the other hand, the reason for this type of activity may\nlie deeper: a person may not transform the environment in a positive way but may\nbreak it down. We call graffiti on walls offensive, obscene, or simply informative or\neven decorative, but carving on fences, rocks, the bark of trees, benches is nothing\nmore than the unauthorized destruction or modification of the property of others\nor public property (Vorobyeva & Kruzhkova, 2012). This is not just a problem\nwith the self-expression or defects of upbringing of some individuals. Who of us\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t write on the desk at school? But why did we do it? Because of boredom, as\na protest, or as the result of a special inner need that we did not express in other\nways? It is possible to answer these questions by means of complex psychological\nresearch that considers vandalism not only when it occurs but also as a result of its\ngenesis previously.\nHowever, there are only a few studies of this question. A small number of publications\nconcerning vandal behavior have focused on aspects of legal regulation and\ncriteria for qualifying destructive actions as vandalism (for example, Harina, 2005;\nPashutina, 2009; Shuruhnov, 2002) as well as on statistics and methods of combating\nthe spread of vandalism in some countries or areas of life (for example, Ceccato\n& Haining, 2005; Pirozhkov, 1994; Shvets & Yakovlev, 2011; Thompson et al., 2012).\nThe number of studies of the psychological bases of vandalism, its personal and environmental\ndeterminants, its forms and manifestations, its motives is quite small\n(for example, Allen & Greenberger, 1978; Coffield, 1991; Cohen, 1973; Goldstein,\n1996; Skorokhodova, 1999); such studies are centered mainly on the evaluation\nof possible preventive actions (for example, Kalmikova, 2013; Patrusheva, 2010;\nSkorokhodova, 1999; Vatova, 2007). One feature of the modern study of vandalism\nin psychopedagogical practice is the relatively limited focus of interest of researchers\non the adolescence and early adulthood of vandals (Gurova, 2014; Samokhina,\n2007; Tserkovnikova, 2011; Vatova; 2000) without taking into account its genesis\nin childhood. At the same time, the consideration of the specifics of vandalism in\ndifferent age periods will not only create a more accurate picture of the forms and\nembodiments of such activity but also help to identify predictors of the formation\nof a vandal model of behavior. This is a necessary basis for the effective prevention\nof destructive behavior because the already-established and implemented strategy\nof dealing with vandalism by directives and judgmental methods brings only a\nshort-term effect, as vandals will always find a way to express their desire for the\ndestruction of private or public property.\nThe genesis of vandalism: From childhood to adolescene 141\nElements of the destructive activity of a person appear in early childhood. But\nat this age destruction is a method of gaining knowledge of the laws and the characteristics\nof the material world, the subjective environment. Despite the result,\nwhich can be very close to vandalism, the child never considers this behavior as\ndestructive and antisocial because, for young children, the limits of acceptable activity\nare yet to be determined and socially prescribed.\nLater, during the preschool years, vandal actions can be a way of studying the\nmaterial aspects of the environment, of understanding the mechanisms of the behavior\nof other people and their reactions to the destructive behavior, and of determining\nmanipulative possibilities to control the behavior of others. A preschooler\nbuilds a prosocial behavior model by reflecting on the reactions of other people,\nboth adults and peers, to destructive behavior. However, excessive destructive activity\nof a vandal character is seen here more as the result of a lack of education than\nas a personal choice of the child.\nWhen a child goes to school, vandal actions are often random, when children,\nbecause of their lack of experience, cannot predict the outcome of their actions,\nwhich can be protective mechanisms for the release of tension and stress arising\nfrom educational or communication failure or excessive psychological pressure\nfrom the social environment.\nTeenagers, whom many authors consider the main perpetrators of vandalism\n(Elliott, Huizinga, & Menard, 1989; LeBlanc & Freshette, 1988; Pirozhkov, 1994;\nVatova, 2007; Vorobyeva & Kruzhkova, 2014), are quite often prone to destructive\nactions against a stranger or public property. Almost all teenagers engage in these\nsmall vandal acts in their communicative environment, without ascribing to them\nvandal values. Because the motivational bases of vandal activity are varied and numerous,\nthe choice of this model can be determined by a combination of personal\nand environmental factors. However, the role of each of these predictors to date is\nquite undefined and empirically not proven.\nAdolescence is characterized by already realized vandal models of behavior\nthat are either integrated into an overall deviant personality or embedded in the\nvalue-ideological component of personality that is formed by conditions of the interactions\nin subcultural space.\nMethod\nThe total sample of the study was 1,522 respondents (42% -boys, 58%-girls)in different\nage groups. These included preschoolers (65), primary school pupils (253),\nteens (448 middle school students), and young adults (466 students in institutions\nof secondary and higher education), also teachers and parents as experts in the\nassessment of children\xe2\x80\x99s behavior (5 expert educators, 10 expert class teachers,\n65 parents of preschool children, 210 parents of children in primary school). All\nstudents in the study were not active vandals, but of the adolescents and young\nadults the majority noted that they had experience causing damage (major or\nminor) to public property or the property of others. The basic indicators reflect\nthose of the normative sample in relation to the characteristics of the population.\nBecause the participants were children from complete and incomplete (brought\nup only by the mother) families, significant differences in the manifestation of \n142 I. V. Vorobyeva, O. V. Kruzhkova, M. S. Krivoshchekova\nwillingness to vandal behavior between these categories of participants in the\nstudy were not revealed.\nThe research methods were a battery of diagnostic instruments, questionnaires,\ntrace tests, and observation methods specific to each age group, as described in the\nfollowing sections.\nPreschoolers\n1. Our protocol for observing the child\xe2\x80\x99s play. This protocol is aimed at determining\nthe characteristics of the child\xe2\x80\x99s interaction with the world of things in the\nprocess of communication with peers. It assesses the manifestation of certain\ntypes of motivational readiness of the child to perform destructive actions in\nrelation to two types of objects: their things (toys) and other people\xe2\x80\x99s things or\nsocial things (toys). Valuations are based on a 5-point Likert scale, in which the\nmaximum score corresponds to a high level of preparedness for engaging in\ndestructive actions with the objects of the material world.\n2. The Parental Attitude Research Instrument (PARI) of E. S. Schaefer and R. Q.\nBell (adapted in Russia by T. V. Neshcheret). This diagnostic examines parental\nattitudes toward various aspects of family life (including toward their interaction\nwith the child). The questionnaire consists of 115 claims, in response to\nwhich the respondent has an option to choose scale points from 4 \xe2\x80\x9cfull agreement\xe2\x80\x9d\nto 1 \xe2\x80\x9ccomplete disagreement.\xe2\x80\x9d The results are described by 23 aspects of\nparents\xe2\x80\x99 attitudes to the child and family life, including 8 aspects of their attitude\ntoward family roles (parochialism of women within the family \xe2\x80\x94 the mother is\nconcerned solely with the family; the mother has a sense of self-sacrifice; presence\nof family conflicts; superauthority of the parents; mother\xe2\x80\x99s dissatisfaction\nwith the role of housewife; \xe2\x80\x9cindifference\xe2\x80\x9d of the father and his noninclusion\nin the affairs of the family; dominance of the mother; dependence and lack of\nindependence of the mother) and 15 aspects of the parent-child relationship\n(verbal manifestations, verbalization; partnerships; development of the activity\nof the child; egalitarian relationship between parents and child; irritability, irascibility;\nseverity, excessive rigor; avoiding contact with the child; excessive care,\nestablishing a relationship of dependence; overcoming resistance, suppression\nof the child\xe2\x80\x99s will; creation of a sense of security; fear of offending the child;\nsuppression of aggression; suppression of sexuality; excessive intervention in\nthe child\xe2\x80\x99s world; desire to accelerate the development of the child). These 15\naspects are distributed according to the three major trends in the parent-child\nrelationship: optimal emotional contact, excessive emotional distance, and excessive\nfocus on the child.\n3. The Parental Attitude Questionnaire of A. Ya. Varga and V. V. Stolin. This diagnostic\nconsists of 49 statements about parental attitudes. Respondents express\ntheir agreement or disagreement with them. The description of the results is in\naccordance with the following scale: adoption/rejection of the child (an emotionally\npositive attitude toward the child indicates adoption; an emotionally\nnegative attitude toward the child indicates rejection); cooperation (adults desire\nto cooperate with the child, they manifest genuine interest and involvement\nin the child\xe2\x80\x99s affairs); symbiosis (unity with the child, contact between the child \nThe genesis of vandalism: From childhood to adolescene 143\nand the adult); control (degree of democracy or authoritarianism in the adults\xe2\x80\x99\nrelationship with the child); attitude toward failure of the child (the adults\xe2\x80\x99 ability\nto assess the child\xe2\x80\x99s strengths and weaknesses, successes and failures).\n4. The \xe2\x80\x9cSuccess\xe2\x80\x9d Program of I. A. Burlakova, E. E. Klopotova, and E. K. Yaglovskaya.\nThis educational program is based on observation of the child and diagnostic\ntests. The technique diagnoses 9 integrative qualities of the child: curiosity;\nactivity; emotional responsiveness; mastery of the means of communication\nand ways of interacting with adults and peers; ability to control behavior and\nto plan actions based on the primary value concepts; ability to observe basic\ncommon norms and rules of conduct; ability to solve intellectual and personal\nproblemsat an appropriate age; mastery of the universal prerequisites for educational\nactivity; mastery of the necessary skills and abilities.\nPrimary school age\n1. A questionnaire that we devised to allow parents to identify the features of the\nchild\xe2\x80\x99s interaction with things in the child\xe2\x80\x99s communication space. This instrument\nconsists of 22 questions, the answers to which are placed on a Likert scale.\nAll questions are divided into three blocks: they characterize the tendency of\nthe child to destroy object, the child\xe2\x80\x99s preference for things belonging to others,\nand the child\xe2\x80\x99s desire for novelty in relation to personal things.\n2. The Parental Attitude Research Instrument, as described above.\n3. Methods for evaluating the parental relationship.\nAdolescents\n1. The questionnaire Personal Psychological Sovereignty of S. K. Nartova-Bochaver.\nThis personality questionnaire consists of 80 statements formed into 6\nscales: sovereignty of the physical body, sovereignty of the territory of things,\ntheories and beliefs, habits, social relations, and human values. Respondents\nare asked to respond on a dichotomous scale (yes/no).\n2. The profile Biography of Subjectivity of O. I. Motkov. This diagnostic consists\nof five blocks that can be used to identify the level of subjectivity of people of\ndifferent ages on a Likert scale according to the following criteria: independence;\nactivity; initiative; creativity; ability to manage emotions, desires, and\nactions; desire for self-development and self-organization; awareness of one\xe2\x80\x99s\nown personality; rationality; harmony of personality; pursuit of middle or high\nachievement.\n3. The questionnaire Motives for Vandal Behavior of I. V. Vorobyeva, O. V. Kruzhkova,\nand S. A. Ostrikova. This instrument diagnoses 10 kinds of motives for\nvandal behavior: aggressive, tactical, caused by curiosity, mercenary, existential,\naesthetic, as protest, caused by conformity, caused by inconvenience, environmental,\ncaused by boredom. The questionnaire consists of 80 statements, each\nof which is evaluated by the respondents on a 4-point scale indicating their\nopinion of the admissibility or inadmissibility of such behavior. The questionnaire\nindicates a decrease or increase in the level of preparedness to commit\nvandal actions and highlights the main motive for destructive behavior.\n144 I. V. Vorobyeva, O. V.

In order to solve research problems\nwe used the following additional techniques:\n\xe2\x80\x93 descriptive statistics to reflect general trends in the parameters of the respondents\n\xe2\x80\x93 two-step cluster analysis to isolate from the total sample homogeneous\ngroups with significant differences between them\n\xe2\x80\x93 comparative analysis (the Mann-Whitney U test) to detect statistically significant\ndifferences between treatment subgroups in the main sample\n\xe2\x80\x93 linear regression analysis to determine the personal and environmental\npredictors of readiness to engage in vandal behavior\n\xe2\x80\x93 structural equation modeling to identify the overall structure of the relationship\nbetween and the interdependence of (1) environmental factors\nand individual personal characteristics of respondents and (2) indicators of\nreadiness to engage in vandal behavior.\nResults\nThe compilation and interpretation of data through the use of complex mathematical\nand statistical procedures and methods of qualitative analysis of the results\nmade it possible to describe the particular manifestations of human activity in the\ncontext of the commission of any vandal actions in relation to private or public\npropertyin each of the studied age periods.\nPreschoolers\nObservation of play and communicative activities allowed us to estimate the incidence\nand manifestations of actions of a vandal character of each observed child.\nThe main indicators were the beginning of play with the child\xe2\x80\x99s own and others\xe2\x80\x99\ntoys; these observations demonstrated the children\xe2\x80\x99s relationship to their own\nproperty as well as to others\xe2\x80\x99 property and to public property. To highlight the be-\nThe genesis of vandalism: From childhood to adolescene 145\nhavior of different groups of children we carried out a two-step cluster analysis,\nwhich at a high confidence level divided the sample into two homogeneous subgroups.\nThe first group comprised the 77% of the children who had adequately\nformed strategies of interaction with their own objects and the objects of others.\nThe second group consisted of the 23% of the children who showed abnormal behavior\nin relation to their own, others\xe2\x80\x99, and common toys. Comparative analysis\nhelped confirm the differences in the behavioral characteristics of the children in\nthe selected groups. Thus, the following performance measures of the activity of\nchildren in the second group were statistically lower than those of children with adequate\nbehaviors: reasonableness (U=248.0; p=.036), harmoniousness of personality\n(U=258.5; p=.055). In addition, for children in the second group the formation\nof integrative qualities was lower on the following parameters: mastery of the\nmeans of communication and ways of interacting with adults and peers (U=277.5;\np=.028), the presence of primary representations of themselves and of their families\n(U=252.5; p=.007). Thus, the children who demonstrated vandal elements in\ntheir actions had difficulty communicating with peers and adults; were impulsive\nand often reacted inadequately in communicative situations (they were aggressive\nor, conversely, too timid); had a poor understanding of themselves and the motives\nfor their actions; and may have had low levels of education for their age.\nThrough the use of regression analysis we obtained 4 models that describe the\ndetermination of the child\xe2\x80\x99s manifestations of vandal activity and the specificity\nof the boundaries of its distribution. Thus, the overall index of a child\xe2\x80\x99s vandal activity\nwas dependent on the application or nonapplication by parents of the type\nof upbringing called \xe2\x80\x9cacceptance\xe2\x80\x9d (model parameters: F=4.8; p=.032; R2=17.1%;\n\xce\xb2=0.267). That is, when a parent likes a child just as the child is, the parent respects\nthe child\xe2\x80\x99s individuality, tends to spend much time with the child, approves of the\nchild\xe2\x80\x99s interests and plans, and contributes to the initiative and creativity of the\nchild to the extent that the child sees fit. Furthermore, this index was also detected\nin specific features of parental attitudes toward the child and the actual parentchild\nrelationship (model parameters: F=4.8; p=.000; R2=40.6%), in particular,\nthe mother\xe2\x80\x99s development of a limited interest in the family (\xce\xb2=0.404; p=.002),\nher dissatisfaction with the role of housewife (\xce\xb2=0.331; p=.013), dominance of\nthe mother (\xce\xb2=0.258; p=.051), egalitarian relationship between parents and child\n(\xce\xb2=0.392; p=.013), inhibition of the suppression of the child\xe2\x80\x99s will (\xce\xb2=\xe2\x80\x930.368;\np=.023), reduction in severity and excessive rigor (\xce\xb2=\xe2\x80\x930.358; p=.007), decrease\nin the \xe2\x80\x9cindifference\xe2\x80\x9d of the father and his noninclusion in the affairs of the family\n(\xce\xb2=\xe2\x80\x930.293; p=.036), restriction of excessive intervention in the child\xe2\x80\x99s world\n(\xce\xb2=\xe2\x80\x930.289; p=.054).\nInterestingly, the child\xe2\x80\x99s destructive activity toward the child\xe2\x80\x99s own things\n(model parameters: F=4.8; p=.000; R2=37.1%) and toward the objects of others\n(model parameters: F=4.9; p=.000; R2=39.9%) were determined by a single\nlist of predictors: suppression of the child\xe2\x80\x99s aggression (\xce\xb2=0.439, p=.011; and\n\xce\xb2=0.377, p=.048, respectively), avoiding contact with the child (\xce\xb2=0.293, p=.025;\nand \xce\xb2=0.323, p=.014, respectively), dependence and lack of independence of\nthe mother (\xce\xb2=0.504, p=.000; and \xce\xb2=0.491, p=.000, respectively), absence of\nthe mother\xe2\x80\x99s sense of self-sacrifice (\xce\xb2=\xe2\x80\x930.324, p=.000; and \xce\xb2=\xe2\x80\x930.610, p=.000,\nrespectively), avoiding excessive strictness and severity (\xce\xb2=\xe2\x80\x930.244, p=.047; and \n146 I.

The borders of their activity in this regard\nwere characterized by mobility; new objects were easily adopted, but there was\nno clear identification of their own things and those of others; this situation can\nprovoke unauthorized use of objects and lead to the appearance of vandal activity.\nIn this case, the integral measure of the tendency of the pupils to commit vanInfantilization\nAuthoritarian\nhypersocialization\nVandalism with\nblurred boundaries\nof personality\nPreference for\nothers\xe2\x80\x99 things\nNewness\nRejection\nSymbiosis\nOptimal emotional\ncontact\nFocus on\nthe child\nDistancing from\nthe child\nF1\n\xd0\xb5\n\xd0\xb51\n\xd0\xb52\n\xd0\xb53\n0.1 0.1 0.1\n0.2\n0.6\n0.3\n0.47\nFigure 1.

This finding confirms the analysis and the representation of children\xe2\x80\x99s vandal\nbehavior in the primary school environment: observation of students in the educational\nenvironment and expert assessment from teachers showed that about 27% of\nrespondents committed acts of a destructive or transformative nature at least once.\nOf these, about 10% showed vandal behavior systematically.\nStudies of the role of the family in the formation of the child\xe2\x80\x99s interactions with\nobjects in the surrounding space, including vandal actions, were carried out by\nstructural modeling. As a result of the application of mathematical and statistical\nmethods, a model was obtained that contains parameters that characterize the system\nof parent-child relations and indicators that reveal the child\xe2\x80\x99s relationship to\nthe world of things (Figure 1).\nThus, the most connected of all diagnosed features of the interaction of the\nchild of primary school age with objects in the surrounding area were a preference\nfor others\xe2\x80\x99 things, a tendency to systematically update the child\xe2\x80\x99s own objects and to\ndepreciate \xe2\x80\x9cold\xe2\x80\x9d objects, and a tendency to destroy or otherwise vandalize objects.\nAdolescents\nA two-step cluster analysis (p<.010) was used to clarify the extent of vandal behavior\nin this age group; the analysis detected the presence in our sample of three\nsubgroups. The first cluster (64% of the respondents) included teenagers whose\nmedian propensity for vandalism was at the normative (low) level with a single upper\nlimit of normal for individual respondents on various scales exceeding regulatory\nlimits by 1\xe2\x80\x932 points. In the second cluster were the 23% of respondents whose\nmedian propensity for vandalism was within the normative range but with a single\nupper limit of normal for individual respondents exceeding regulatory limits by\n5\xe2\x80\x9310 points. The third cluster included the 13% of respondents whose median propensity\nfor vandalism clearly exceeded the statutory limit; the propensity of many\nof these respondents exceeded the upper limit of normal by 15 points or more.\nThese subgroups were subsequently compared with each other with respect to the\nstrength of their characteristics of vandal activity (on the Mann-Whitney test).\nThe statistics showed that the teenagers in the first and second groups with\nstandard indicators of propensity for vandalism did not differ significantly from\neach other. However, there were substantial differences in the adolescents in the\nsecond and third groups on the following variables: a harmonious personality\n(U=34.5; p=.025); resistance in difficult situations (U=33.0; p=.022), sense of\nidentity (U=39.5; p=.051). In the group with a high propensity for vandalism the\nrate of vandal activity was significantly higher than that for the normative sample.\nThis finding can be explained by the fact that for teenagers the mechanism\nfor development is self-assessment and awareness of the outward result of specific\nactions. Thus, damaging others\xe2\x80\x99 property or public property can contribute to an\nincreased understanding of themselves and their capabilities; it provides training\nfor appropriate behavior in difficult situations and a generally positive assessment\nof themselves through overcoming social norms and prohibitions.\n148 I. V. Vorobyeva, O. V. Kruzhkova, M. S. Krivoshchekova\nAs a result of our analysis and synthesis of existing approaches, we can suggest\nthat the sovereignty of psychological space and the orientation of teenagers\non certain personality characteristics can act as preconditions for the formation of\nreadiness to commit acts of vandal behavior. For the mathematical and statistical\ntreatment of data we used multivariate regression analysis; the general parameters\nof the resulting model were: F=12.4; p=.000; R2=10.3%. As a dependent variable\nwe chose the overall motivational readiness of teenagers to commit vandal actions;\nsuch actions cause changes in the sovereignty of the physical body (\xce\xb2=0.202;\np=.005) and the sovereignty of the world of things (\xce\xb2=\xe2\x80\x930.108; p=.012).\nThus, it can be assumed that the expression of teenagers\xe2\x80\x99 motivational readiness\nto commit vandal acts is initiated because of the aborted sovereignty of psychological\nspace and thus is a violation of ideas about the acceptable limits of this activity.\nTeenagers who have some problems understanding their own bodies and physiological\nneeds and are overall dissatisfied with themselves are likely to choose a\nbehavior that involves causing harm to other people\xe2\x80\x99s property. Perhaps a compensatory\nmechanism is triggered that arises from internal discontent with themselves\nand their existence in the subject-object environment. In addition, deprivation of\nsovereignty of the world of things also provokes vandal activity. Problems with the\ndefinition of the boundaries of others\xe2\x80\x99 property lead to unauthorized use. This feature\nmay form in teenagers because of a lack of personal belongings in the sensitive\nperiod for the ontogenesis of this behavior. And if the first cause for readiness to\nengage in vandal behavior and even for some awareness in choosing such behavior\nis a teenager\xe2\x80\x99s compensatory reactions and defensive positions, the second cause is\nclosely related to a violation in the ontogeny of adequate ideas about the world and\na person\xe2\x80\x99s place in it.\nYoung adults\nThe young-adult sample was also subjected to a two-step procedure of cluster analysis\non the diagnostic data questionnaire Motives for Vandal Behavior (p<.050).\nAs a result, three clusters were identified. The first cluster included the 56% of respondents\nwhose median propensity for vandalism was at the normative (low) level\nwith a single upper limit of normal for individual respondents on various scales\nexceeding regulatory limits by 1\xe2\x80\x932 points. In the second cluster were the 35% of\nrespondents whose median propensity for vandalism was at the upper end of the\nnormative range with many individual respondents exceeding the regulatory limits\nby over 9\xe2\x80\x9310 points. In the third cluster were the 9% of respondents whose median\npropensity for vandalism clearly exceeded the statutory limit; the propensity\nof many of these respondents exceeded the upper limit of normal by 15 points or\nmore.\nTo identify features of the representation parameters of the subjectivity of the\nrespondents with regard to their propensity for vandalism, we conducted a comparative\nanalysis of selected clusters using the Kruskal-Wallis test with a refining\npairwise comparison to the Mann-Whitney test. Nonparametric criteria were used\nin connection with the disequilibrium number of comparison groups, and therefore\nthere are substantial differences in dispersions. In general, the respondents\nin the third cluster, with a high propensity for vandal acts, had most of the char-\nThe genesis of vandalism: From childhood to adolescene 149\nacteristics of vandal activity at significantly lower levels than did respondents in\nthe other groups. Thus, a smaller number were aware of their own personalities\n(H=6.1; p=.048), had nontypical internal accounting requirements and external\nconditions in the construction of behavior (H=10.2; p=.006), experienced dissonance\nin the relationship of themselves and the world around (H=6.6; p=.037),\nand lacked focus on the achievement of high results (H=5.8; p=.057). In addition,\npairwise comparisons of those in the third cluster and those in the second cluster,\nwhose propensity to commit vandal acts was expressed to a middle degree, revealed\na significant difference in the parameter diversity and interest in life (U=2040.5;\np=.032), which was less characteristic for the third group.\nTo clarify the nature of the relationship characteristics of vandal activity and\nmotivational readiness to engage in vandal behavior in the group with a high propensity\nfor vandalism, we conducted a correlation analysis (Spearman\xe2\x80\x99s rank coefficient).\nWe found that mercenary motives for vandalism, which involve the commission\nof such acts for personal gain, were linked to the desire for outstanding\nachievements in various fields (r=0.457; p=.025). It can be assumed that a business\nmodel is adopted by some people as a valid option because of their high need for\napproval, ambitious goals, or tendency to perfectionism. In this case, the person\nis ready to use any means to achieve the desired outcome. Protester vandalism,\ncaused by the desire to register one\xe2\x80\x99s disagreement with something, was negatively\ncorrelated with initiative (r=\xe2\x80\x930.569; p=.004), ability to manage emotions, desires,\nand actions (r=\xe2\x80\x930.471; p=.020), positive emotional tone (r=\xe2\x80\x930.526; p=.008), and\nwillpower (r=\xe2\x80\x930.412; p=.046). Or perhaps the choice of an antisocial activity model\nthat was detrimental to the property of others or to public property resulted from\nhaving a nihilistic outlook as well as from failing to regulate and control one\xe2\x80\x99s own\nbehavior. Vandalism caused by boredom, the desire to occupy oneself with something,\nhad a direct correlation relationship with initiative (r=\xe2\x80\x930.440; p=.032). A\nhigh need to realize oneself can give rise to a misunderstanding of a situation, and\nthe result is destructive vandal actions committed for temporary distraction and\nentertainment.\nThe analysis of the young adults\xe2\x80\x99 motivational readiness to commit vandal acts\nrevealed ten possible motives. One of the most prevalent was the motive of curiosity;\nThis motive was present in about about 21% of the respondents; they had\na pronounced tendency to choose vandalism as a way of studying the world and\nthemselves. In our analysis of curiosity as a motive in our group of respondents\nwe formed a regression model that explains it through various properties of the\nrespondents\xe2\x80\x99 subjectivity (model parameters: F=8.0; p=.001; R2=80%). These data\ndescribe the \xe2\x80\x9ccuriosity vandals\xe2\x80\x9d as being emotionally positive, active, and sociable\n(\xce\xb2=0.705; p=.013), capable of self-control (\xce\xb2=0.984; p=.002), but not fully accepting\nof themselves as a whole person (\xce\xb2=\xe2\x80\x930.667; p=.010) and not agreeing with\nthe terms and circumstances of their life (\xce\xb2=\xe2\x80\x930.525; p=.005). In addition, they\nare not capable of volitional effort in everyday life (\xce\xb2=\xe2\x80\x931.000; p=.001), they lack\ninitiative (\xce\xb2=\xe2\x80\x930.842; p=.004), and the most complete realization of their personal\npotential occurs in stressful emergency situations (\xce\xb2=0.894; p=.002). This characteristic\nleads them to take risks in potentially contentious interactions with the\nenvironment. They choose vandal actions as a convenient way to get information\nabout themselves from the outside world.\n150 I. V. Vorobyeva, O. V. Kruzhkova, M. S. Krivoshchekova\nThe results showed a complex subject-personal determination of vandal behavior\nin the young adults and suggest that they not only can destroy and harm the\nsubject-material environment by such actions but can use such behavior as a tool,\na means of implementing cognitive activity aimed at themselves, in order to better\nunderstand their own \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x9d, including in the system of social relationships.\nThe determination mechanisms of vandal behavior in the young adults were\nidentified by using structural models. A statistical procedure included two contrast\ngroups of these respondents: those with a strong propensity to commit vandal\nactions and those who lack such a propensityThe resulting models allow us to\ndescribe the direction activity (to the outside world or to oneself) in the context\nof readiness to harm someone else\xe2\x80\x99s property or public property and taking responsibility\nfor this activity. Thus, in the group of respondents with normative behavior,\nactivity had both vector directions: to the outside world and to the subject, and\nthe respondents expressed willingness to take responsibility for their actions and\nresults. Accepting responsibility in this way leads to activation of work on selfdevelopment\nand self-improvement (Figure 2). Vandal actions then become unnecessary\nbecause the transformation is internal and subject-oriented.\nThe group of young adults with a strong willingness to commit vandal behavior\ndid not have an internal implementation of vector activity, preferring an externally\noriented (environmental) expression of themselves. At the same time they are ready\nto take responsibility for their actions, and the vandal activity was demonstrative\nand of an oppositional character. The results of such actions are not analyzed, are\nnot internalized, and do not lead to internal changes (Figure 3).\nThus, young adulthood was found to be a period of increased tendencies to\ncommit vandal actions.

A more detailed study (Vorobyeva & Krivoshchekova,\n2014) of the psychological readiness of young men to damage someone else\xe2\x80\x99s\nproperty or public property has shown that the key phenomenon that triggers the\nmechanism of choosing vandal behavior is a disordered orientation toward activity.\nHaving the ability to work on this problem and change oneself can minimize the\nrisk of vandalism in young adulthood.\nDiscussion\nAccording to the study. the preschool children who in their actions demonstrated\nelements of vandal behavior had difficulty communicating with peers and adults,\nwere impulsive, often reacted inappropriately in communicative situations (were\naggressive or, conversely, were too shy), poorly understood themselves and the motives\nfor their actions, and may have had a low level of education for their age.\nSome importance is attached to building a culture of interaction with the objective\nworld through the parent-child relationship.

V. Vorobyeva, O. V. Kruzhkova, M. S. Krivoshchekova\nThe preconditions for the vandal behavior of preschoolers are excessive distancing\nfrom them, suppressing their will and practical activity, and not making\nreasonable demands of them or constructive contact with them. These preconditions\ncan be the result of lack of interest, indifference toward the child, or parents\xe2\x80\x99\nlack of self-confidence in their role as educators.\nAdequate behavioral expectations are formed in families with a high level of acceptance,\noptimal emotional contact, and optimal dependence on the family; these\nfamilies also provide adequate but nonexcessive care for their child. The choice of\npassive strategies can lead parents to refuse to have contact with the child, to have\na fear of offending the child, and to exhibit a strong sense of self-sacrifice. When\na child commits acts of elements of vandalism, that behavior contributes to a high\nlevel of parental evasion of contact with the child, a significant suppression of the\nchild\xe2\x80\x99s will and attempts to overcome the child\xe2\x80\x99s resistance, and the presence of maternal\nfeelings of dependency and lack of independence. At the same time securing\npro-social models promotes rigor, the desire to accelerate the development of the\nchild, and an egalitarian relationship between the parents and the child.\nPupils\xe2\x80\x99 orientation toward things that do not belong to them cannot be considered\nexclusively as a negative aspect of their personality. For example, young\nchildren may choose others\xe2\x80\x99 toys (in the presence of their own), but in this case\ncuriosity and the novelty effect satisfy them if parents use pro-social behavior strategies,\nsuch as making requests, cooperating, sharing. However, there are opposite\noptions\xe2\x80\x94deception, taking possession of another\xe2\x80\x99s things, causing damage\xe2\x80\x94that\nare more closely associated with the kinds of negative behavioral patterns that a can\ndemonstrate in relation to objects in the environment. Our analysis showed that\nthe causes of these patterns are specific features of the parent-child relationship,\nsuch as a lack of emotional contact between the parent and the child, the distancing\nof the parent from the child, and parental rejection of the child. Accordingly,\nwe can assume that on the one hand the actions of the child may be dictated by the\nobjective need, significant for his age group, for things the parents do not buy for\na variety of reasons. On the other hand, numerous studies show that when these\ntypes of parental behavior occur, the child has for the most part already been provided\nwith everything necessary but feels the need not for material objects but for\nthe attention and participation of the parents. In this connection, the preference for\nothers\xe2\x80\x99 things and taking them without the permission of the owner can be a kind\nof compensatory response to a rift in the family and, in some cases, can be a way to\nattract attention . It is as if the child at an early age replaces a system of social relationsespecially\nthe one that was supposed to be a priori emotionally comfortable\nand safe, more predictable, and already well established action systemwith material\nobjects in the previous age periods.\nThe child\xe2\x80\x99s desire to systematically update the objective world on the one hand\nmanifests itself in regular requests for new things and on the other hand accompanies\nthe inadequate treatment of already-owned objects. Thus, the child loses,\nbreaks, gives away, or just does not use the thing requested and at the same time articulates\nnew requests. Such a strategy expresses the symbiotic position of the parent\nand the child, which manifests itself in the parent\xe2\x80\x99s effort to meet all the needs\nof the child in order to protect the child from troubles and difficulties. The more\nparents are focused on creating comfort for the child to meet the world through a \nThe genesis of vandalism: From childhood to adolescene 153\nwide variety of needs for a diversity of things, the less meaningful these things are\nfor the child. As a result, the child may have no realistic idea of the value of the\nobjects and the possibilities for their acquisition.\nPreschoolers\xe2\x80\x99 tendency to destruction and damage of items often appear as unconscious\nvandal acts. In this case, the children are well aware of the process by\nwhich these acts occur and most likely can predict the result but do not realize\nthat such behavior is proscribed because the objects are not their personal property.\nOften, such objects are identified by pupils as \xe2\x80\x9cunnecessary,\xe2\x80\x9d and they do not\naccord them any importance for society, a group, or an individual. Such a view\noccurs when the parents maintain a maximum distance from their children. Probably\nthe lack of systematic interaction between parents and children, which not\nonly forms values and beliefs about the world but also generates awareness of the\nchild\xe2\x80\x99s place in it, leads children to misunderstand the borders of their actions. As\na result, forms of interaction with the outside world, including the world of things,\nare formed spontaneously in a child under the influence of situational factors that\ncan lead to feelings of mistrust and inferiority. The vandal actions of these children\nare performed systematically and unreflectingly. The children are not aware of the\nsocial unacceptability of their actions, and the motivational basis of this behavior\ndepends on the experience of interacting with the world that they received in the\ncourse of their development.\nThus, vandal behavior is most characteristic of adolescence and young adulthood\nbut has a long genesisand forms from the early stages of ontogeny. Younger\nchildren who damage someone else\xe2\x80\x99s property or public property are not always\naware of the negative social meaning of their actions, but in this period the stable\ninstallation of the intentional infliction of harm to material objects can take place.\nPersonality development is due largely to the social factor, the system of parentchild\nrelationships remains a key element of it in the period of primary school age.\nIt is precisely in these conditions that children\xe2\x80\x99s pictures of the world are determined\nby the value-semantic aspect of material objects and socially acceptable ways of interacting\nwith them as well as by the formation of mechanisms for reflecting the\nsocial characteristics of children through their own things and attitudes toward\nthem. Destructive parent-child relationships negatively affect the development of\nchildren and form their misconceptions about themselves and their place in the\nsystem of social relations and in their relations with the objects of the material\nworld. Thus, excessive distance from or even rejection of the child initiates certain\nbehavioral patterns of destructive actions of a compensatory-demonstrative nature\nin relation to other people\xe2\x80\x99s things. Conversely, an excessively symbiotic relationship\nwith a child devalues the physical environment, both the child\xe2\x80\x99s own things\nand objects belonging to the society or other people.\nConclusion\nBased on the results of the study the mechanism for the formation of vandal activity\ncan be suggested it has the following roots in the genesis of age development..\nBecause of the child\xe2\x80\x99s special relationship with significant adults, the nature\nof the child\xe2\x80\x99s interaction with the subject environment is determined largely by the\nparent-child relationship (Lisina, 1997; Rozhdestvenskay, 2002). When a child of \n154 I. V. Vorobyeva, O. V. Kruzhkova, M. S. Krivoshchekova\npreschool age commits vandal actions toward others\xe2\x80\x99 property or public property,\nthe child is guided mainly by an emotional outburst or negative feelings (jealousy,\ndesire to avenge), and the regulation of the conduct does not involve the deep reflexes.\nExcessive control, lack of requirements, and subject-object variants of parents\xe2\x80\x99\nand caregivers\xe2\x80\x99 relationships with preschoolerslead to deformation of ideas\nabout acceptable limits of the implementation of activity, which in turn contributes\nto children\xe2\x80\x99s choosing vandal behavior as a strategy for meeting urgent needs. In the\nearly school years vandal activity is latent. Changing the social situation of development\nleads to children\xe2\x80\x99s experiencing the effect of novelty. They are dominated by\nsocial motives for educational activity and an acute sense of responsibility for behavior;\nthey are important in the eyes of their reference groups of adults and peers\n(Davydov, 1990). This situation creates conditions for control and self-control and\nmakes it almost impossible for the emergence of actual forms of vandalism. However,\nin this period the internal readiness of the child to consciously choose vandal\nbehavior in the future as a way to solve personal problems forms. Because of the\nconservation role of parents in shaping the boundaries of the permissible activity\nof the child, the presence of disharmonious parenting styles in a family creates the\npreconditions for the emergence of psychological readiness to consciously choose\nvandal actions.\nVandal actions are most evident among teens (Vatova, 2000); at this periodin\nthe normal development of the personality there are two options for the initiation\nof such a deviation. In the first case, vandalism is a result of experimentation with\nthe social, objective environment or the person\xe2\x80\x99s own capabilities and is characterized\nby situational poverty; such behavior gradually loses its relevance for the\nmaturing personality. In the second case, vandalism is a manifestation of conformity:\nvandal acts are a way to maintain social acceptance and identification of a\nteenager in a reference group. Here vandalism is not an aim itself; for a teenager it\nacts as an element or type of joint activity that creates a sense of belonging to the\ncommunity. Teenagers who have not formed at earlier stages of development the\nnecessary social and reflexive skills because of external conditions compensate for\ntheir powerlessness and incompetence in the social sphere by making a destructive\nimpact on the objective environment for the purpose of self-knowledge his experiences,\nopportunities and the other\xe2\x80\x99s relationships with him and his activities.. Thus,\nvandal activity allows teenagers to indirectly perform the basic tasks of their age\nin order to form a self-image, but it simultaneously reinforces a deviant pattern of\nbehavior.\nIn the next age period\xe2\x80\x94young adulthood\xe2\x80\x94this model is fixed and compounded;\nyoung adults continue to know themselves and their capabilities through the\ntransformation of the environment, including the unauthorized destruction of its\nfacilities. The energy that goes into normative development in the formation of\nself-knowledge and is based on the trajectory of future life here is replaced by externally-oriented\nactivity, including activity of a destructive nature. In addition, those\nyoung adults who previously chose vandalism because of group pressure reinforce\nthis behavior through their inclusion in youth subcultures, many of which directly\nor indirectly commit vandal actions for ideological reasons.\nThe genesis of vandalism: From childhood to adolescene 155\nAcknowledgments\nThis study was conducted with funding from a grant from the President of the\nRussian Federation for state support of young Russian scientists and PhDs: MK-\n4245.2013.6.\nReferences\nAllen, V., & Greenberger, D.

aS'Three Ideological Orientations in School Vandalism Research\n\n\n\n\n ABSTRACT. School vandalism is one of the major problems threatening\n the educational system of various western countries. We review the\n literature on this topic and point out some of the difficulties that hamper\n a thorough understanding of this social phenomenon. We emphasize those\n strategies that have been found to be successful in reducing the incidence\n of this offence. We interpret the available information in terms of three\n ideological orientations: conservative, liberal, and radical, each of which\n can be shown to result in effective policies. The choice as to which strategy\n to employ on a national basis thus depends less on its proven efficacy\n than on the values and attitudes of those concerned with the problem.\n Hence, we argue that future investigations into school vandalism must\n adopt an "action research" approach, that is, research that continually\n assesses the effect that certain manipulations have on a specific school\n system. Representatives of all interested parties (teachers, parents, and\n students) must decide with the principal which particular strategy changes\n the existing conditions most favorably for all concerned.\n Over the last 20 years educators, policymakers, and the public at large have\n shown increasing concern about the waste due to school vandalism. The Safe\n School Study Report, published by the U.S. National Institute of Education (NIE,\n 1977) noted that the estimates of school vandalism in the United States run from\n about $50 million to $600 million, with most estimates in the $100-200 million\n range (p. 3). The NIE itself estimated that the yearly cost of replacing and repairing\n items damaged by vandalism was about $200 million.\n Because of the costs involved and the implied detrimental effect on the educa-\n tional process, the problem of school vandalism has led to many attempts to\n discover why it occurs and how it can be solved. Numerous explanations have been\n offered and many solutions expounded. As is often the case in social science,\n disagreement is rife.\n It is common for school principals and teachers to lament the loss of discipline,\n the violent attitude of contemporary youth, and their apparent inability to respect\n property. More and more, alarm systems and security officers are employed to\n catch the juvenile delinquent, and calls are made for a restructuring of the court\n system or the proper implementation of (parent) restitution programs. Yet other\n The literature search presented in this report was made possible by a grant obtained from\n the New Zealand Department of Education and the Winnifred Gimblett Scholarship awarded\n to the first author.\n 263\nThis content downloaded from 128.95.104.66 on Thu, 20 Apr 2017 19:10:37 UTC\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\n ZWIER AND VAUGHAN\n school administrators believe that the fault lies in the school system itself. They\n urge changes in the physical surroundings (i.e., building design and grounds) and\n in the school\'s social climate. Change in climate might follow from changes in\n curricula, size of school, degree of student participation in decisionmaking proce-\n dures, assessment methods, special programs, and so on.\n The inability of social scientists to pinpoint the causes or cures of school\n vandalism has added to the general confusion. Correlations exist between a high\n incidence of vandalism and variables such as the age of the principal (the older, the\n more vandalism!), teacher apathy, academic failure, a derelict appearance of the\n school, and community disinterest in school affairs. Hundreds of studies report\n what school vandalism is "actually" due to, and even more document many and\n various successful programs that can be put into effect; but there is virtually no\n consensus about the causes of vandalism, and even less agreement about effective\n methods in dealing with the problem.\n The present analysis\' attempts to bring some order to this field by drawing out\n the theoretical and methodological problems that have plagued research and by\n offering an ideological framework within which investigations have proceeded.\n School vandalism is a complex phenomenon, the causes of which change with\n the ideology that researchers impose on it. Thus, although it is obvious that a brick\n actually does go through a window pane and smashes the glass, the identification\n of the reason(s) for the act, and what should be done to prevent it from recurring,\n presuppose social values and an ideological orientation in the investigator. Our\n argument hinges on three main reasons.\n First, a study of the causes of school vandalism can be approached on various\n levels of analysis. Let us take the analogy of a bridge collapsing during a heavy\n traffic flow. Was it due to an overstress of its materials (lack of foresight by the\n consultant engineers); to a traffic flow exceeding its rating (negligence by the bridge\n controllers on duty); or to a weakening of foundations through successive earth\n tremors (an act of God)? Such explanations may compete, may overlap, and may\n be offered as attack or defense in a legal inquiry. In a similar way, the question\n "Why does school vandalism occur?" can be answered by pointing the finger at the\n deviant individual, a particularly rigid and authoritarian school administration, or\n to apathy in the school and the community alike.\n It is our view that there is no criterion for judging that one level of explanation\n is more "correct" than another. They may be independently correct, or they may\n be parts of a chain of causal processes, as in Figure 1.\n Even where such a chain may seem plausible, there may be yet another chain\n emphasizing different causal agencies, such as poor background of pupil -> aca-\n demic failure - pupil-teacher conflict - vandalistic act.\n Second, social scientists are not immune from holding preconceived notions.\n They can hold an opinion about solving a problem and then seek support for both\n \'Most of the material that the report draws on was obtained through a computerized\n retrieval system provided by the Auckland University Science Library. Their intercontinental\n satellite communication system taps the memory banks of a California-based computer. For\n reasons of access, the study focuses almost exclusively on studies from the United States and\n Commonwealth countries.\n 264\nThis content downloaded from 128.95.104.66 on Thu, 20 Apr 2017 19:10:37 UTC\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\n ORIENTATIONS IN SCHOOL VANDALISM RESEARCH\n opinion and solution. The result is that scientific evidence can be obtained for\n virtually any relationship which common sense may suggest. If no such evidence\n exists, the resourceful researcher can predict that someday someone will discover a\n situation in which the correlation holds. Scientific practice does not need to consist\n of hypothesis testing in the "real" world, but may merely delineate the conditions\n under which a particular hypothesis may be true (McGuire, 1980). This issue is\n important in evaluating school vandalism research and will be raised again. Suffice\n it to note here that there is no criterion for judging which test (and which correlation)\n should be regarded as most important.\n Third, even a repeatedly confirmed correlation between a variable and a vandal-\n istic act does not imply a causal connection. Although more vandalism occurs in\n larger schools, not every small school experiences less vandalism. Again, largeness\n of school may be nested in another factor, such as largeness of town or teacher\n turnover. Although evidence may show a correlation, the basis on which causal\n chains are inferred is intuitive. In the theoretical murk surrounding school vandal-\n ism, there is no criterion for judging if a particular causal inference is justified.\n We will propose that, because there is no compelling evidence for one major\n cause or several minor causes of school vandalism, the choice of which variable to\n study or strategy to employ is ideological. The choice depends on, and to an extent\n characterizes, the values of the individual. Because ideological orientations are best\n known through political expression, we have adopted that terminology in distin-\n guishing three: conservative, liberal, and radical.\n However, before the ideological dimension of school vandalism research can be\n explored and its implications understood, we must note that studies in the field\n suffer from problems that make it difficult to provide a systematic, heuristic, and\n comprehensive review. Two such problems are (a) a definition of school vandalism,\n and (b) measures used to indicate incidence and trends. We propose a three-by-\n three matrix, incorporating the ideological dimension, to classify the numerous\n strategies that have been employed to solve school vandalism. The description of\n this taxonomy and a review of several cruder classifications suggested by other\n authors, namely Koch (1975), Marvin, Connolly, McCann, Temkin, and Henning\n (1976) and Rubel (1978), precede an application of the matrix to some strategies\n that have been used.\n 265\nThis content downloaded from 128.95.104.66 on Thu, 20 Apr 2017 19:10:37 UTC\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\n ZWIER AND VAUGHAN\n Finally, some implications of our proposals are examined. Here we suggest that,\n because the study of school vandalism suffers from conceptual confusion and from\n serious methodological flaws, a radical change in research strategy is in order. We\n argue that future investigations of school vandalism must adopt an "action research"\n approach, that is, research that continually assesses the effect of certain manipula-\n tions on a specific school system.\n What Is School Vandalism?\n There may be as many definitions of school vandalism as there are teachers,\n principals, and social science researchers concerned with the problem. All such\n definitions are arbitrary.\n Panko (1979), attempting to obtain a consensus by sorting 2,516 statements,\n arrived at the following definition: School vandalism is "unauthorized intentional\n damage and theft of school and district property, excluding theft for material gain\n of the actor and associated damages, if any" (p. 592). Thus for an act to be\n vandalistic, it needs to be intentional or, as Thaw (1980) noted, "hostility directed."\n As such, broken furniture and smashed windows do not ipso facto constitute acts\n of vandalism, and certainly not if they are due to thoughtlessness and/or careless-\n ness. One can never be sure that a broken window is due to malicious intent, unless\n the vandal is caught in flagrante delictu.\n Moreover, some intentional acts such as scratching one\'s desk, are so common\n that they might be regarded as part of normal wear and tear. At an English school,\n it was found that 85% of the boys admitted to having scratched their desks, 65%\n admitted to having written on walls in the street and more than 25% confessed\n they had broken furniture or a window at school (Gladstone, 1978).\n The practice of adding up the costs of replacing broken windows, furniture, and\n fittings, and labeling this "expenditure due to vandalism," assumes that the damage\n was intentional and the action criminal. To regard the same as "wear and tear," on\n the other hand, can lead to reserving the label for damage to expensive items such\n as sound equipment or to damage that might follow from breaking and entering\n school buildings.\n It is important to keep this observation in mind, because a modification in one\'s\n definition of vandalism will affect the response strategies developed. If a certain\n behavior were regarded as "fairly normal," it would be sensible to concentrate on\n changes in the environment (e.g., by replacing glass by Lexan, a hard-to-break glass\n substitute), rather than to attempt a change in pupil behaviour (e.g., by using\n behavior modification techniques).\n Incidence and Measurement: How Do We Go About It?\n The fact that acts of school vandalism can be reported in various ways has\n constituted a major source of incongruity among the results of many studies, and\n signals the need for a standard record maintenance system (McCrosky, 1979). Most\n used indices are repair costs, number of incidents (i.e., break-in and entry, appear-\n ance of graffiti, damage or theft), number of convictions during a certain period,\n and self-reports. More recently, the psychological impact of vandalistic acts also\n has been used to evaluate their seriousness.\n 266\nThis content downloaded from 128.95.104.66 on Thu, 20 Apr 2017 19:10:37 UTC\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\n ORIENTATIONS IN SCHOOL VANDALISM RESEARCH\n Each index of school vandalism has faults that are compounded when used\n indiscriminately. For instance, records showing number of incidents or monetary\n loss due to vandalism are subject to the ambiguity with which school vandalism\n has been defined: What one school principal records as normal wear and tear,\n another reports as an act of school vandalism. Also, it has become practice for\n some school officials to want to "hush up" the problem for fear of giving the school\n a bad name. It would also be consistent that because more vandalism is expected\n in lower socioeconomic areas, school officials would be more vigilant in detecting\n incidents. Finally, variables outside the system may further modify the indices:\n Young and Soldatis (1970) suggest that a decrease in the breaking of school windows\n may be offset by an increase in the unit repair cost, so that an overall increased\n expenditure may be reported (e.g., Steele, 1978).\n The idea that there should be more concern with the social impact of school\n vandalism than with repair costs deviates from the tendency to view the issue in\n purely monetary terms. Instead, it encourages people to take note of the social cost\n involved.2 Vestermark and Blauvelt (1978) have proposed a two-by-two matrix to\n show that some incidents can be high in monetary costs but low in social costs,\n and vice versa, and other incidents can be both high or both low in social and\n monetary costs.\n Self-reports are rarely used. When they are (e.g., Gladstone, 1978), they can be\n very revealing, especially with respect to motives and the relative incidence of\n certain practices. Yet they suffer the drawback common to all self-report measures\n when taken at face value: The extent of bias is not known.\n Even an apparently objective method of assessing the incidence of vandalism,\n such as the number of convictions per year, is subject to influence. The NIE (1977)\n suggests that in one case changes in the law were resnonsible for an increase in the\n number of offenses. Although it seemed that the nurt er of vandalism offenses had\n increased, closer inspection revealed a decrease in the proportion of vandalism\n offenses compared to the total number of criminal offenses (see also Stace, 1978).\n Added to the confusion of difference among methods, there is a wide variation\n in scientific quality of research projects. Some studies include control schools or\n schools matched on various criteria (e.g., Daniels, 1976; Mayer & Butterworth,\n 1981). Sometimes specific sampling procedures are followed, for example, stratified\n (Daniels, 1976) or random (Schrock, 1979). Structured interviews (e.g., Hevern,\n 1977; Smith, 1966) are conspicuous by their absence.\n When questionnaires are used, they tend to be developed for the specific study\n in question, making comparison among such studies difficult. This is despite the\n existence of two well-elaborated instruments: the Organization Climate Description\n Questionnaire (e.g., Kaiser, 1972) and the Purdue Teacher Opinionnaire (e.g.,\n Ellison, 1975).\n On the theoretical side, there are few truly insightful analyses such as Cohen\'s\n (1968, 1971). Literature reviews (e.g., Davis, 1972; Sturm, 1979) do little more\n 2 This method has only recently been introduced and, perhaps partly because of the\n difficulties involved in the actual measure of social impact, has so far had little response from\n the educational community.\n 267\nThis content downloaded from 128.95.104.66 on Thu, 20 Apr 2017 19:10:37 UTC\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\n ZWIER AND VAUGHAN\n than describe previous research and summarize correlational data. Although many\n researchers note many variables, most give personal, piecemeal accounts of how a\n particular school has dealt with, or failed to deal with, vandalism.\n To be fair, all kinds of factors, some inherent in the system and others imposed\n on it, can make a research project extremely difficult. A detailed enumeration and\n analysis of these problems would require a study in itself. Instead, we argue that\n most difficulties can be overcome by reconceptualizing the scientific process used\n to study school vandalism.\n Finally, the abundance of alternative reporting methods and types of research\n has led to widespread disagreement over whether the incidence of school vandalism\n is increasing or decreasing. Many (e.g., Sabatino, Heald, Rothman, & Miller 1978;\n "Violence in the Schools," 1975) hold that school vandalism is increasing through-\n out the United States. Several recent extensive surveys have found, however, that\n although there probably was an increase in American school vandalism through\n the sixties and early seventies, there has since been a leveling off (Hevern, 1977;\n NIE, 1977; Rubel, 1978; Steele, 1978; Watson & Darling-Hammond, 1978; Wilson,\n 1976). The apparent increase in vandalism for a given community over time may,\n of course, dissipate in light of variations in reporting, measurement, and even the\n expectations of the investigator. The decision to use one measure rather than\n another seems to depend as much on its availability and ease of access as it does\n on personal inclinations and biases.\n The Ideological Dimension\n Most acts of school vandalism are against a system, the school. Blame therefore\n could be attributed to the individual or the system. To blame the individual is to\n emphasize the importance of preserving the system as is. The school system,\n according to this view, is functioning well. The same view regards the act as\n meaningless and likely to be executed by an aberrant, sick individual. Thus, the\n system is preserved, but the person\'s behavior should be changed.\n In the alternative view, the vandalistic act is regarded as meaningful and symp-\n tomatic of an important shortcoming in the school system. The act, although not\n justifiable, is a predictable response to a sickness inherent in the system. Thus, the\n solution is to change the system, thereby reducing or eliminating circumstances\n conducive to vandalism.\n Of course, most everyday instances of school vandalism are not blamed on either\n one or the other; the reasons for its occurrence are more often attributed to both.\n Only for clarity do we separate these opposing viewpoints (and introduce an\n intermediate viewpoint) in our proposal. Our matrix incorporates the three political\n orientations: conservative, liberal, and radical (see Table I).\n The conservative stance entails, by definition, the preservation and maintenance\n of existing institutions. This and the following definitions are taken from the\n Random House Dictionary (Stein & Urdang, 1973). School vandalism is regarded,\n like any other crime, as a threat to the system. Studies that adopt this political\n perspective identify the person as the cause of school vandalism: School vandalism\n is the intentional destruction of school property by a person or persons.\n A liberal framework moves away from traditional values and conventional ideas\n about the need to preserve and maintain established institutions at all costs and\n 268\nThis content downloaded from 128.95.104.66 on Thu, 20 Apr 2017 19:10:37 UTC\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\n TABLE I\n The Relationship Between Ideological Orientation, Assumption Concerning the Cause of School Vandalism, and Type of Solution Offered\n Ideological orientation and assumption of\n cause\n Conservative\n Vandals are deviant.

Possible causes may be the\n irrelevance of the curriculum, aggressive leadership by the principal, extreme\n competition induced by the grading system, and the teaching style of the staff.\n Finally, the radical stance is based on the assumption that the existing social\n system, of which the school is part, is in some way debilitating and therefore must\n change. The radical attitude is not Marxist in the sense that it advocates drastic\n political, economic, or social reforms (although it does exist-e.g., see Liazos,\n 1978). Rather, it emphasizes that the cause of school vandalism lies neither in the\n individual nor in the school system, but in the immorality, violence, and general\n apathy evident in our society.\n Each of these ideological orientations is apparent in the literature. The conserv-\n atives will show that school vandalism is due to deviant individuals, who must be\n deterred; the liberals will produce evidence blaming the school; the radicals will\n contend that the disinterest of the whole community is at fault.\n The second dimension of the matrix (see Table I) denotes the level of analysis\n on which the solution to the problem is sought. Many researchers and school\n administrators focus on a specific solution to the problem, namely, deterring or\n apprehending the school vandal, or, better still, designing and protecting the school\n in such a way that no damage can be done. Others, however, have less specific\n solutions, such as programs set up to beautify the school or to instill pride, teaching\n conflict resolution techniques for teachers, special programs for students, encour-\n aging positive student attitudes, or involving students in decisionmaking processes.\n Finally, there are those who believe that changes brought about in the relationship\n between community and school will have an effect on the incidence of vandalism.\n This strategy is very diffuse: Any changes in the incidence of vandalism could be\n due to many variables. Examples are the involvement of the community in school\n affairs or in antivandalism patrols, the use of the school for after-hour activities\n such as sport or health and social services, and "community education."\n It is no accident that this level-of-analysis dimension corresponds conceptually\n to the ideological dimension to which it is juxtaposed in our matrix. We must\n remember that the identification of the cause of a social problem is tantamount to\n the discovery of its solution. In fact, at first we presumed that each ideological\n orientation would search for its particular solution, that is, the conservatives,\n content with dealing with symptoms only, would focus on specific solutions, while\n the radicals, intent on going to the "causes," would suggest diffuse solutions (Zwier\n & Vaughan, 1980). This is not the case.\n Our three-by-three matrix shows that each ideological orientation (conservative,\n liberal, radical) can be combined with the level of analysis (specific, diffuse) on\n which the solution is sought, resulting in nine categories. These categories provide\n the schema in terms of which we discuss our overview of the research.\n Previous Classificatory Research\n Social science researchers have made several attempts to tidy up the myriad of\n studies. One group of investigators, Marvin et al. (1976), suggested that programs\n set up to deal with student violence could be classified as: (a) organizational\n modification, which focuses on educational changes; (b) curricular/instructional\n 270\nThis content downloaded from 128.95.104.66 on Thu, 20 Apr 2017 19:10:37 UTC\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\n ORIENTATIONS IN SCHOOL VANDALISM RESEARCH\n programs, which deal with students in need; (c) security systems; and (d) counseling\n services.\n Similar, but more inclusive, models and approaches were developed by Lemert\n (1967) and Cohen (1973a, 1973b), and extended by Koch (1975) to include the\n following strategies:\n (1) writing-off: the problem is insolvable, bearable, or too costly to solve;\n (2) functional alternatives: controlled destructiveness or other energy outlets;\n (3) technological: technical (e.g., bugging) or architectural (e.g., building design);\n (4) social structural: applies to rules, roles, communication, and grouping in the\n school;\n (5) educative: communication media and formal teaching;\n (6) legal-punitive: strict enforcement, punishment, and restitution;\n (7) therapeutic: treatment;\n (8) cooperative or primary participative: making the controllees controllers, or\n involving localized communities in youth control;\n (9) societal change: eliminating or minimizing crimogenic conditions in the\n larger society.\n The problem with classifying programs in this manner is that it is insufficiently\n heuristic. Although it is useful as a mopping-up operation by categorizing programs,\n it lacks a model specifying the unifying principle(s). Examples of such principles in\n science are the common lineage of species; similarity between artifacts; personality\n types or, as in our case, the type of assumptions embedded in each of these\n programs. Although the classifications outlined take note of assumptions, they do\n not, and cannot, specify the types of cause or solution (or strategies, programs,\n methods) that are being used; the dimensionality of the unifying principle is not\n explicit. By placing the ideological dimension by which causes are identified\n orthogonal to the degree of specificity of the solution, we derive a system that\n accommodates every instance and subsumes any system of categories previously\n offered.\n It is evident that the first program described by Marvin et al. (1976) is liberal,\n and the other three are conservative. The conservative programs regard the vandal\n as maladjusted, as a person who has not developed adequate skills to cope with the\n school environment, and from whom we have to protect the school, staff, and other\n students.\n Koch\'s (1975) strategies (1), (3), (6), and (7) are conservative in character, because\n school vandalism is regarded as a threat to the system. Although strategy (2) implies\n that the "need" for destruction can be in some way redirected, strategies (4) and\n (5) suggest that it may be transformed into acceptable behavior within the school\n environment. Both imply a liberal orientation leading to a modification of the\n school system. Finally, strategies (8) and (9) endorse a radical position because the\n potential school vandal and the community are required to be involved in organ-\n izing and running the school system so that the system itself is changed.\n Rubel (1978) provides an exception in specifying a unifying principle. He\n suggested a dichotomy between programs that assume that students can make\n rational decisions and those that do not. One implies that students should be\n included in, and the other suggests they should be excluded from, the decisionmak-\n ing process by which antivandalism strategies are implemented. In our approach,\n 271\nThis content downloaded from 128.95.104.66 on Thu, 20 Apr 2017 19:10:37 UTC\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\n ZWIER AND VAUGHAN\n a program that excluded students from decisionmaking would be deemed authori-\n tarian and would derive from a conservative orientation. Our idea of a radical\n orientation is one that implies a collective responsibility of teachers, students, and\n parents, and certainly that students be involved at the beginning of the process.\n While Rubel\'s framework is not without merit, it is our view that an analysis\n highlighting the ideological assumptions concerning the phenomenon is more\n fundamental.\n Our orientation-solution matrix provides a new perspective for discussing several\n selected studies. Space precludes including program details of all of the studies\n referred to. Several, however, are chosen to illustrate in some depth the implications\n of our propositions.\n An Overview of Causes and Strategies\n The Conservative Orientation\n Pupils who commit acts of vandalism must be deviant. They must be deterred\n or, better still, caught and punished. Several preventative strategies may be adopted\n to deal with the problem. First, the physical environment must be protected.\n Second, with the students\' cooperation, school vandalism may be prevented and\n offenders detected more often. Third, the community must become involved in\n antivandalism patrols and programs. From the literature it appears that most\n schools that endorse the conservative orientation have adopted the first strategy.\n The physical environment. Nearly half of the literature on school vandalism\n concerns itself with the design and protection of school buildings. Many detailed\n accounts have been written on how best to "vandal proof\' the school (Irwin, 1978;\n Sabatino, 1980; Zeisel, 1976) and the classroom (Hathaway & Edwards, 1972;\n James, 1974). The illumination of school buildings is a favorite preventative strategy\n among school administrators (e.g., Falk & Coletti, 1982). Eight ways to prevent or\n contain fires are listed in Juillerat (1972), and more general information is given in\n "Arson, How To Defend Against the Most Destructive School Crime" (1976).\n A whole series of electronic gadgets are available to deter or capture vandals.\n Besides the more conventional siren or revolving red light, there are various "space\n detection alarms," such as microwave and ultrasonic sensors and infrared alarms\n (e.g., Faily & Roundtree, 1979). There are mechanical detectors, for example,\n magnetic contact switches, door buttons, taut wires, pressure pads, light beams or,\n among the more expensive, closed circuit television (e.g., Kravontka, 1974). The\n decision to employ these methods and instruments may reduce to a cost-effective-\n ness balance (Irgang & Gelber, 1981; Schnabolk, 1974), and may depend on the\n kind of damage being done to the school (Huntington, 1981; "School security\n systems," 1974).\n As with other strategies, the effects of alarm systems are difficult to assess because\n they are often used in conjunction with other methods (e.g., volunteer patrols).\n Their effectiveness increases of course when used for a dual purpose (e.g., as a fire\n detection service).\n Although most research appears to indicate that sophisticated alarm systems are\n fairly effective (Canadian Education Association, 1977; Jacobs, 1980; Sabatino et\n al., 1978; Sabatino, 1980; "Vandalism, a Special Report," 1973), some is less\n 272\nThis content downloaded from 128.95.104.66 on Thu, 20 Apr 2017 19:10:37 UTC\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\n ORIENTATIONS IN SCHOOL VANDALISM RESEARCH\n encouraging (e.g., Greenberg, 1974; NIE, 1977; Schnabolk, 1979). In a survey of\n 4,000 U.S. principals, many considered some of the more complicated electronic\n alarm systems undependable (NIE, 1977).\n One massive project focused on crime prevention through environmental design\n (CPTED). It took 4 years and $4 million to complete and was undertaken on the\n premise that "the proper design and effective use of the physical environment can\n be combined to reduce the propensity of the physical environment to support\n criminal behavior" (Westinghouse Electric, 1976, p. xiii).3\n The operating hypotheses, which we would describe as stipulations, were (a) to\n keep unwanted persons out (with locks and gates, signs and hedges); (b) to keep\n intruders under observation (either by means of mechanical techniques and/or by\n authorized personnel); (c) to reinforce certain activities or add new ones, making\n use of the already existing facilities (e.g., by encouraging interaction between\n students and staff, by promoting school pride, etc.); (d) to change criminal moti-\n vation by providing psychological deterrents and by promoting public awareness\n and involvement.\n Although the short time span and small sample size (four schools) makes it\n difficult to assess whether the exercise was a success statistically, the actual effect\n on the incidence of school vandalism was weak: Only one of the four schools\n showed a decrease in the number of incidents of school vandalism over a 3-year\n period. The other three schools followed the country trend of a threefold increase\n in vandalism from the first to the second year and a plateau from the second to the\n third. The authors state, "No reliable conclusions can be drawn regarding the\n institutionalization of the CPTED concept" (Westinghouse Electric, 1978, sec. 7,\n p. 65). However, they do suggest that "in future projects, a greater effort should be\n made to have key local resource persons-including students, faculty and princi-\n pals-play key decisionmaking roles" (sec. 8, p. 3).\n Notwithstanding the above, others have reported that schools employing resident\n caretakers have a lower incidence of vandalism (Clarke, 1979) and, conversely, that\n inadequate custodial services contribute to school vandalism (Brenton, 1975;\n Goldman, 1959). Principals often prefer security personnel over electronic security\n systems. In large schools, the use of the security personnel is highly recommended\n (NIE, 1977, p. 7). It would seem, however, that the successful custodian is interested\n in the students of that school (e.g., Ertukel, 1974).\n These results, however, cannot be generalized because the methods used are\n unscientific and usually there is no research design (i.e., lack of controls or\n standardized tests or choice of parameters that differ radically between situations).\n In short, the failures or successes of these projects do not bear on the effectiveness\n of the various strategies, but if any inference can be made at all, it is that the\n impoverished role assigned to students and members of the community could\n underlie many project failures.\n The school system. Instead of seeing the social processes of peer group interaction\n as leading to school vandalism, the same basic need for prestige and self-affirmation\n 3 Although this project appears to focus on environmental design, and may conceivably be\n categorized as part of the liberal orientation, the stipulations made explicit by the authors\n reveal that a significant role is played by the protection of the school.\n 273\nThis content downloaded from 128.95.104.66 on Thu, 20 Apr 2017 19:10:37 UTC\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\n ZWIER AND VAUGHAN\n can be usefully employed to fight vandalism (see "Conflict Management Student\n Leadership Program," in Reed & Avis, 1978). Two instances of this strategy were\n reported in "Ways of Fighting Vandalism" (1968) and by Ertukel (1974). The first\n of these described the "Youth Vacation Vigil," which watched over school property\n during the summer vacation months and on the celebratory night of Halloween.\n This program commenced when local police trained high school junior and senior\n students selected because of peer group respect for their ability as students or\n athletes. As "area captains," their task was to visit the various schools in the district\n and to inform the pupils of a planned antivandalism program. The purpose was to\n make more students proud of their school, thus stimulating their sense of respon-\n sibility. The effectiveness of involving respected students as spokespersons for the\n program appeared to be great. Over a 2-year period, vandalism expenditure in\n Akron, Ohio, was cut in half(from $10,000 in 1962 to $5,000 in 1964). The same\n strategy used in conjunction with several others also appeared to be successful at\n the Memorial High School in Madison, Wisconsin, where 97 vandalism incidents\n in 1 year were reduced to 30 in the following year (Olson, 1981; see also Clement,\n 1975, and Ertukel, 1974).\n Another approach that focuses on building protection and student involvement\n is that of a "contingency contract," that is, an agreement between students and\n school officials that the size of the school fund allocation to students decreases as\n the level of vandalism increases during a given year. One such program was\n implemented at Alto Loma (California) Junior High. By reducing the school fund\n for each act of vandalism, the district\'s expenditure of repairing damages due to\n vandalism went from $40,000 one year to $7,000 the next year ("Vandalism: A\n Special Report," 1973). The project was hailed as so successful that it was introduced\n at other schools in the South San Francisco Unified School District (see also\n Fernandez & Cardenas, 1976; Kiernan, 1975). Similar success was reported in\n Liverpool, England, where members of a youth centre received financial support\n in exchange for reducing vandalism (Gladstone, 1978). While this "give-and take"\n exchange philosophy appears fair and promising, it does have drawbacks. Not all\n losses attributed to students are caused by students; some may be due to outsiders.\n Also, a few "bad kids" may spoil the contract by continuing their vandalism; and\n if funds allocated are used up before the budgetary period runs out, the contract is\n rendered useless, because the deterrent value of the program has evaporated (Rubel,\n 1978).\n Finally, in the case of the continual offender, psychological treatment may be\n the best remedy. Indeed, some success has been achieved by psychologists using\n individual and group therapy, including several behavior modification techniques\n (token economy, contingency contracts, group guidance meetings). Brooks (1974)\n and Haney (1973) report success with behavior modification for some persistently\n troublesome adolescents.\n The community at large. The conservative orientation is apparent in the various\n roles assigned to the community in reducing school vandalism. First, there may be\n a concerted effort to enhance community vigilance (e.g., all parents may be asked\n and encouraged to report suspicious behavior). As is often the case, however,\n opposing conclusions are drawn regarding the effectiveness of this method. It was\n reported in a study in the Elk Grove Unified School District (California) that 17\n 274\nThis content downloaded from 128.95.104.66 on Thu, 20 Apr 2017 19:10:37 UTC\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\n ORIENTATIONS IN SCHOOL VANDALISM RESEARCH\n schools participated in a program called "Vandal Watch." The program extended\n the original idea of community vigilance and antivandal patrols by providing cheap\n accommodation for people who would keep watch. Families in mobile homes next\n to the school buildings notified the police of anything suspicious. The 17 schools\n (with a student population of 10,000) were said to have saved the district more\n than $20,000 a year in vandalism-related costs. The program has been seriously\n considered by other school districts in California, New York, Hawaii, and Canada\n (see "Live-in School Sitters," 1974).\n Why, then, do we find in Nottingham, England, a group of policymakers who\n conclude that the consensus is that "anti-vandal patrols by parents/teachers should\n be positively discouraged and that closer collaboration between parents/teachers/\n police through PTA\'s might achieve better results" (Consortium of Local Authori-\n ties Special Programme, 1976, p. 5)?\n A second strategy involving the community, but resorting to punitive measures,\n is that of parent restitution. In 1973 the Los Angeles Juvenile Court sponsored a\n program called the "Prevent School Vandalism Project." This was an intensive\n effort to force all school vandals or their parents to pay for the damages done.\n Much publicity was given to the warning that the parents of the vandals would be\n taken to court and that the courts would actively assist schools in filing proper law\n suits. The program turned out to be a failure. Not only was it estimated that a mere\n 10% of all school vandals in the district were caught but, of these, only one in five\n ever repaid any money to the school system (Sabatino et al., 1978; Tross, 1977).\n Notwithstanding the outcome of this project, 46 American states enacted parent\n liability statutes in 1975, 10 of which specifically dealt with the destruction of\n school property by pupils. It is, of course, possible that these legislators hope that\n such prosecution would have beneficial secondary effects, such as "consciousness-\n raising" (see Grealy, 1974).\n To conclude this section, apprehending and punishing the school vandal does\n not eliminate the source of the problem; dealing with a symptom appears to be\n ineffectual. Thus the Central Policy Review Staff\'s Report suggested that the case\n for punitive measures was "very thin," and that no evidence existed to indicate that\n harsh punishment would deter the vandal (Haydon, 1978). However, parents of\n other pupils and school principals who want to see justice done are not impressed\n by this. They complain about the leniency of courts dealing with juvenile offenders\n and about the inadequate support they feel they are receiving from the courts (Koff,\n 1979; Wilson, 1976). For this reason, a restructuring of the juvenile court system\n may well be in order (cf. "Citizens\' Juvenile Justice Task Force Recommendations,"\n 1981).\n The Liberal Orientation\n Pupils who commit acts of vandalism do so because the school system is\n malfunctioning. First, it may be that the design of the school and the layout of the\n school grounds encourages students to indulge in vandalism. The solution would\n be to modify the physical environment, for example, by making it more durable\n or attractive. Second, the incidence of vandalism may be reduced by allowing\n pupils and the community at large to use the school buildings after hours. This\n could have the dual result of discouraging the pupils from vandalizing occupied\n 275\nThis content downloaded from 128.95.104.66 on Thu, 20 Apr 2017 19:10:37 UTC\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\n ZWIER AND VAUGHAN\n buildings and keeping them off the street at the same time. Third, there may be a\n need for changes in (a) the curriculum (such as its relevance); (b) the way teachers\n cope with potential conflict situations or with teaching in general; or (c) the\n leadership style of the principal.\n Our review of the literature reveals that the liberal orientation has a predilection\n for endorsing the third approach.\n The physical environment. The school setting may increase the likelihood of the\n vandalistic act taking place. Zeisel (1976) even suggests that poor school designs\n (easy access, hidden alcoves, large hard-top surfaces) invite damage. This leads\n some to argue that perhaps more than half of what purportedly is school vandalism\n really is "non-intentional damage caused primarily by bad school designs" ("Van-\n dalism, a Special Report," 1973). So how do we make the school buildings less\n accident-prone?\n As the literature on this subject is much too large to detail in this paper, only\n two of the most frequently discussed variables will be examined: the use of glass\n and the age of the school buildings.\n According to Weiss (1974), a 1968 poll conducted by the journal Nation\'s Schools\n found that 69% of school vandalism costs went toward the replacement of glass.\n Many others have reported similarly high costs due to glass breakage (e.g., Canadian\n Education Association, 1977; O\'Grince & Hodgins, 1974). As exposed glass is\n extremely vulnerable to playful or malicious vandalism, it must be replaced by\n something less breakable. Many schools have found the solution in Lexan, a glass\n substitute. The Canadian Education Association\'s survey of 47 school boards found\n that those school officials who thought that there was a downward trend in the\n incidence of vandalism costs attributed it to this glass substitute.\n Another variable thought to relate to the incidence and cost of vandalism is the\n age of the school building. The evidence for this hypothesis, like for so many others,\n is far from conclusive. Goldman (1961) found that a building\'s age was significantly\n related to damage: Older buildings were vandalized more often. This finding is\n supported by evidence reported by Cohen (1970), Cramer (1978, cited in Howard,\n 1978), and Hevern (1977). Kaiser (1972) and De Buzna (1975), however, did not\n find such a trend. In fact, contrary data from a survey undertaken by the National\n School Public Relations Association pointed to more vandalism in newer schools\n (Wells, 1975).\n Overall, it appears that it is not so much the age of the school building that\n matters, but its appearance (De Buzna, 1975). Several studies, two of which are\n discussed here, critically investigated the effect of this variable.\n Pablant and Baxter\'s (1975) study is often quoted as rigorous in evaluating the\n effect that landscaping and lighting have on the incidence of school vandalism.\n Having matched 32 schools of Houston, Texas, on variables such as neighbourhood,\n income level, ethnic background, school size, and elementary versus secondary\n school buildings, they found that aesthetic quality and level of preservation of\n school property (regardless of age or architecture of the buildings) was negatively\n related to the incidence of school vandalism. Consequently, they suggested that\n little vandalism will occur at schools high in aesthetic quality.\n Earlier, a program developed among Baltimore City Public Schools (Lloyd, 1968)\n produced results congruent with Pablant and Baxter\'s. In this experiment, various\n 276\nThis content downloaded from 128.95.104.66 on Thu, 20 Apr 2017 19:10:37 UTC\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\n ORIENTATIONS IN SCHOOL VANDALISM RESEARCH\n multiunit, relocatable buildings were placed next to the conventional brick-and-\n mortar school building. They were painted in bright colors and had what were\n considered aesthetically pleasing features. After a time it became evident that,\n although the old school buildings were heavily vandalized, the new units received\n little damage.\n One of the foremost theorists in project planning has been Newman. His book\n Defensible Space: Crime Prevention Through Urban Design (1972) has received\n much attention from social scientists interested in preventing or reducing vandalism\n in general (e.g., Mayhew, 1979; Stace, 1978). His basic premise was that people\n must feel that the environment belongs to them and that they can be proud of it.\n This increases their responsibility and their desire to protect the environment.\n However, his specific design suggestions have not always reduced the incidence\n of vandalistic behavior (see Reppetto, 1974; Mawby, 1977a, 1977b; Wilson, 1978,\n cited in Mayhew, 1979). Even where such projects have been successful, the results\n may not have been an outcome of the design adopted. For instance, an action\n project undertaken by the National Association for the Care and Resettlement of\n Offenders (1978) in Britain, originally inspired by Newman\'s theory, is reported to\n have concluded that "the improvement is attributed much less to the \'defensible\n space\' modifications, as to the greatly improved community spirit and improved\n communications between local residents and the local council" (Clarke, 1979, p.\n 141).\n The school system. Research has not clarified whether the school principal should\n adopt a "law-and-order" approach, with a strict adherence to rules, or a humani-\n tarian" attitude, allowing the pupils some say in the educational process. Wint\n (1975) gives examples of the approaches used at two schools. According to the\n testimonials given by the two principals, both styles led to a positive school\n atmosphere and a low incidence of violence and vandalism. So which manner of\n leadership is more desirable?\n An examination of other research clarifies this point. Goldman (1961) correlated\n teachers\' perceptions of their school administration with the incidence of vandalism\n at their schools. Teachers in schools that suffered more vandalism thought that\n their school administration was weak and casual. In contrast, those from relatively\n peaceful schools regarded the administration as strong and democratic. In particular\n "the method and clarity of communication by the principal was a factor in the\n feeling of teacher satisfaction" (cited by Howard, 1978, p. 59).\n However, there is no clear-cut evidence of a correlation between a positive school\n climate and a low incidence of school vandalism: While Howell and Grahlman\n (i977) found a correlation, Kaiser (1972) did not.\n A factor that may eventually be found more important than student input into\n rule formulation is the consistency with which school rules are enforced. A\n Systematic Management Plan for School Discipline by Duke (1977) focused on the\n school as a rule-governed institution, and incorporated six strategies: (a) compiling\n accurate data on the sources and targets of student misdemeanors; (b) rewarding\n students who obey school rules; (c) teaching conflict resolution skills to help make\n students more effective in problem situations; (d) developing and maintaining an\n awareness of the school as a rule-governed institution; (e) establishing a team\n approach involving teachers, parents, and community, as well as students; and (f)\n 277\nThis content downloaded from 128.95.104.66 on Thu, 20 Apr 2017 19:10:37 UTC\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\n ZWIER AND VAUGHAN\n providing inservice teacher education, in acquiring specific skills for handling\n problem children and in continuing to offer new ideas on school discipline. The\n specific effect of each of these measures may be difficult to determine. However,\n the superiority of consistent rewards over consistent punishment, the failure of\n inconsistent patterns of reinforcement, and the importance of learning through\n modeling have all long been established by research into behavior modification\n techniques.\n Teacher apathy (Kiernan, 1975), or a disinterest in their pupils (Cardinelli, 1970),\n a lower degree of identification with the school (Goldman, 1959), a high percentage\n of teacher turnover (Leftwich, 1978), many years of service (De Buzna, 1975), and\n even the older age of the principal (De Buzna, 1974; Leftwich, 1978) have all been\n found to correlate with a high incidence of violence and vandalism in schools.\n Goldman\'s (1959) interview with 367 teachers at 16 high schools in Syracuse,\n New York, is one of the classic studies probing teacher attitudes toward school\n vandalism, Damage occurring at each school was classified on a "damage scale."\n In addition, a questionnaire was administered to 1,170 students. In comparing the\n responses of teachers or students of two or more schools with a similar damage\n rating, Goldman found that teachers in high-damage schools held different attitudes\n from those in low-damage schools. In particular, teachers at high-damage schools\n were more casual, more critical, or less enthusiastic about the school. In answer to\n the question why some schools should suffer more vandalism than others, these\n teachers emphasized the role of the school administration, the age and location of\n the building, and poor teacher control in the classroom. On the other hand, teachers\n from low-damage schools emphasized interpersonal relations as well as the role of\n the school staff, the age and academic achievement of the student, the interest of\n the student in school, and the experience of the teacher.\n Goldman\'s research suggests that reducing vandalism may be contingent on the\n teachers\' ability to identify with the school and to appreciate it as an integral part\n of the community. More recently, Mayer and Butterworth (1981) focused on\n teaching teachers alternative classroom instructional and management techniques,\n arguing that such skills were paramount in reducing school vandalism.\n A frequently cited, successful strategy involving changes in the school curriculum\n is the crime prevention program put into effect in 10 of Little Rock\'s (Arkansas)\n Public Schools (Gibson & Jones, 1978). This program consisted of a 15-hour\n criminal justice course curriculum and of employing specially selected crime\n prevention personnel to visit the various schools. The result was apparently dra-\n matic. In 1 year the number of burglaries decreased almost by half, though follow-\n up figures were not given.\n Duke\'s (1977) review reported promising results suggesting that changes in the\n curriculum affect student behavior patterns. School discipline problems may de-\n crease when the teaching of moral and affective education is offered, when skills\n for coping with specified problems are developed in the pupils, and when pupils\n are helped to understand what is important to them and what their rights and\n responsibilities are.\n The community at large. Lack of parental support and noninvolvement of the\n community at large have often been correlated with vandalism at schools (Steele,\n 1978). Thus many schools encourage parent participation and seek cooperation\n 278\nThis content downloaded from 128.95.104.66 on Thu, 20 Apr 2017 19:10:37 UTC\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\n ORIENTATIONS IN SCHOOL VANDALISM RESEARCH\n from local businesses in setting up community-oriented programs. Sometimes the\n aim is directed at vandalism at a chosen school and sometimes at reducing crime\n and violence in the entire community (Palmer, 1975).\n The liberal orientation encourages community involvement because of the\n imagined effect on the activities of the would-be vandal. Thus, extended recreational\n activities may be provided to keep children meaningfully engaged and off the street.\n Again, the school premises may be used after hours for health and social services\n to deter potential vandals. Further, school advisory councils may be established to\n plan, implement, and evaluate programs.\n Thus, the liberal rationale for community cooperation is primarily to combat\n vandalism without the punitive measures advocated by the conservative approach.\n In contrast, the radical orientation will argue that it is intrinsically wrong to permit\n a rift between school and community, and that the effect of any strategy on the\n incidence of school vandalism is therefore only of secondary importance.\n What evidence is there of the effectiveness of strategies aimed at reducing the\n opportunities for vandalistic behavior? Although school vandals are not necessarily\n violent (NIE, 1975, p. 5), it has often been found that the crime rate and the\n presence or absence of fighting gangs in the neighborhood of the school affect the\n level of violence in the school (e.g., Bayh, 1975).\n Gladstone (1978) reported one of the most thorough investigations of the peer\n group of the English school vandal. Stratified cluster samples were obtained based\n on age, religion, school access (selective or nonselective), and level of deprivation\n of the schools catchment area. The questionnaire covered issues such as use of\n leisure time, parents\' attitudes, the type of groups to which boys belonged and the\n boys\' attitudes toward school, and the boys\' involvement in vandalism, theft, and\n aggressive behavior. The final form of the questionnaire was administered to 605\n adolescent school boys.\n Gladstone\'s evidence suggested that a male student was more likely to become a\n vandal when (a) there is lax parental control, (b) the pupil is a low achiever, (c) he\n dislikes school, and (d) he spends much of his free time in the company of a\n "tough" street gang. There are many difficulties involved in attempts to increase\n parental control, but new policies or new programs instigated at the school and\n aimed at these would-be vandals may be effective. For instance, Bagley (1965, cited\n in Gladstone, 1978) found that cities that spend more of their financial resources\n on leisure facilities for adolescents reported a lower incidence of delinquency.\n American research also confirmed that increasing provision for leisure leads to a\n reduction in delinquent behavior. However, Gladstone concluded,\n By and large, however, reliable evidence is extremely scarce and provides\n little basis for recommending one or another form of leisure provision as a\n remedy for vandalism. But equally the lack of evidence is no reason to dismiss\n the approach. (pp. 38-39)\n In concluding this section, we must mention again the difficulties involved in\n evaluating the effect that extracurricular activities have on the incidence of school\n vandalism. Not only is the solution very diffuse, but most studies report such a\n conglomeration of ways to involve the community that the efficacy of a specific\n 279\nThis content downloaded from 128.95.104.66 on Thu, 20 Apr 2017 19:10:37 UTC\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\n ZWIER AND VAUGHAN\n method cannot be evaluated. (For an "action manual" detailing the collective\n measures that can be taken, see Goodman, 1975.)\n The Radical Orientation\n Vandalism is a normal reaction to debilitating conditions. The anonymity so\n characteristic of large schools and the competitiveness induced by present assess-\n ment procedures are perhaps the most obvious reasons why pupils come to dislike,\n even hate, the school system and all that it symbolizes. Such feelings of malcontent\n and aggression are generally inhibited, but now and then surface as school violence\n and vandalism of school property. The way to reduce such behavior is to note the\n symbolic meaning of the act. According to this view, it is as useless to deter, or\n catch, the individual school vandal as it is to make the cosmetic changes that the\n liberal orientation suggests. Large and impersonal schools lacking in community\n orientation must be abandoned, as must the competitive assessment system. In the\n final analysis, it is this system that is responsible for the low self-image and negative\n attitude of so many students. The radical orientation emphasizes cooperation and\n community involvement.\n The physical environment. The finding that large schools experience more van-\n dalism than small schools appears to be an accepted fact. A Canadian report\n compiled for the Ottawa Board of Education indicated that large schools are more\n likely to be vandalized (Tross, 1977; see also Rubel, 1978), while De Buzna (1975)\n showed that the number of incidents was positively related to the number of\n students enrolled in the school (De Buzna, 1975; Sturm, 1979). Yet correlational\n research does not imply causality. It may be that it is not size per se that makes the\n difference between schools that are vandalized often and schools that are not\n (Lesser, 1978, p. 402). For example, Kingston and Gentry\'s (1978) conclusion\n (cited by Howard, 1978), suggests that lack of student involvement may be\n responsible for much antisocial behavior. In contrast to students in smaller schools,\n those in large high schools are less likely to identify with the school or to participate\n in various school activities, leading to more frequent disciplinary problems.\n There appear to be three main strategies that will decrease the level of student\n anonymity and increase the level of student identification with the school. The first\n is the obvious one of preventing small schools from becoming larger. The second\n is to reorganize the number of enrolled students at a large secondary school into\n separate clusters, which, given time, would develop their own identity. Lesser\n (1978) reported that this strategy may indeed decrease disruption to the system.\n The third solution, often used as part of a larger program, is to somehow encourage\n a feeling of belonging. For instance, by teaching the students at the Walker-Jones\n School (Washington, D.C.) the importance of conservation and aesthetics in\n relation to their school and their community, it was hoped that the students would\n show more pride in being a Walker-Jones student. This occurred, and an increase\n in cooperative efforts at school and community was noted. There were fewer broken\n windows and a decrease in vandalism expenditure (Sabatino et al., 1978; "Taming\n Campus Vandals," 1980; "Ways of Fighting Vandalism," 1968). Rose (1977) listed\n 27 specific suggestions for establishing an atmosphere that combined improved\n self-image with improved school-image.\n 280\nThis content downloaded from 128.95.104.66 on Thu, 20 Apr 2017 19:10:37 UTC\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\n ORIENTATIONS IN SCHOOL VANDALISM RESEARCH\n The school system. Academic failure and a generalized resentment of everything\n that is related to school are often cited as factors in the incidence of school\n vandalism (Block, Covill-Servo, & Rosen, 1978; Cardinelli, 1970; Davis, 1972;\n Frease, 1973; Goldman, 1961; Lunden, 1968; Miller, 1974; Nowakowski, 1966;\n Palmore & Hammond, 1964; Stripling, 1978; Swift & Spivak, 1978; von Kronen-\n berger, 1978). As expected, academic failure is often instrumental in conditioning\n perceptions of low self-esteem among students (Gold, 1978), possibly adding to the\n negative feelings experienced through anonymity (Murillo, 1977).\n A recent study carried out under the auspices of the U.K. Home Office (Glad-\n stone, 1978) found lack of success to be associated with involvement in vandalism:\n "Those boys who saw themselves as successful at school were also much more\n likely to see themselves as good at exams, to intend to stay on at school after 16,\n and to aspire to a white-collar job" (p. 31).\n Congruent with this, changes in the curriculum and in the assessment procedures\n are suggested by Pringle (1973) and by De Buzna (1975). Pringle (1973) reported a\n positive correlation between violent and disruptive behavior on one hand, and a\n curriculum that emphasizes competition rather than individual achievement on\n the other. De Buzna (1975) showed that the incidence of school vandalism is\n inversely related to the number of alternatives the high school student has within a\n program of study. These studies propose that a curriculum with many options and\n a system of assessment that emphasizes individual achievement rather than inter-\n personal competition may help reduce the number of incidents.\n However, academic failure and a negative attitude toward school emerge as\n independently related to the incidence of vandalism. This suggests that, even if all\n students were successful in their work (an outcome requiring that alternative\n learning and assessment processes are adopted-see Barr, 1981; Gold, 1978), it\n would still not guarantee that they would regard the school in a positive light\n (Gladstone, 1978).\n The community at large. The radical orientation argues that the root of school\n vandalism is in poor interaction between school and community. A problem cannot\n be solved by strategies developed within the system that mothered the problem. Its\n source must be approached by increasing community support for, and involvement\n in, the school.\n Research to date indicates that community involvement generally, but not\n always, results in a lowered incidence of school vandalism. Studies specifically\n concerned with this issue were carried out by Daniels (1976), De Buzna (1975),\n Ellison (1975), Macri (1974), Palmer (1975), Pullen (1973), Schrock (1979), Sor-\n rentino (1975), Steele (1978), and van Voorhees, Cwik, and King (1975). (There is\n also a film showing successful student- and community-oriented strategies em-\n ployed by six American communities-see Wales, 1978.) Ellison (1975) and\n Schrock (1979) have reported a zero relationship between community involvement\n in school processes and a reduction in vandalism. The others point to a range of\n successful programs, some of which are discussed below.\n In a large survey organized by the U.S. Community Education Association, 47\n school boards indicated whether they had asked the community for help. Only\n 22% replied "yes," and a great variation in the success of the strategy was reported\n (Steele, 1978).\n 281\nThis content downloaded from 128.95.104.66 on Thu, 20 Apr 2017 19:10:37 UTC\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\n ZWIER AND VAUGHAN\n As Chair of the Senate Subcommittee to Investigate Juvenile Delinquency, Bayh\n (1978) attended numerous hearings and listened to more than 500 testimonies of\n educators, teachers, and concerned citizens. Although a number of suggestions\n were made, he was convinced "that the most important element in the prevention\n of school violence and vandalism is the active involvement of the entire education\n community in local efforts to accomplish this goal" (p. 301).\n Community support and involvement is perhaps best known through the concept\n of community education. Steele (1978) reported a nationwide survey of 1,006\n people employed by local education agencies with community education programs.\n According to Steele, community education consists of a program involving a\n director advised by a council of community residents and delegates from commu-\n nity organizations. This group would initiate research into community needs,\n develop plans to meet these needs, and, following implementation of a project,\n evaluate its effectiveness. Steele further noted that "the critical element identifying\n Community Education is the involvement in decisionmaking of citizens at the\n neighborhood level in determining needs, priorities, programs, and evaluation of\n factors affecting the quality of life in their own communities including the schools"\n (p. 85).\n Sorrentino (1975) was one of the first to report a successful community program\n carried out in the Flint School District (Michigan) over a 25-year period. The\n school district policy involved (a) obtaining the cooperation of local community\n organizations, (b) year-round recreation and enrichment programs, (c) a yearly\n distribution of a handbook describing the rights and responsibilities of students, (d)\n the employment of physical security measures, and (e) the involvement of parents\n in security affairs (see also Koch, 1975; Steele, 1978). Although an increase in\n school vandalism in that district has been noticed over the years, it has apparently\n stayed well below the national average.\n A rigorous test of the effectiveness of community involvement in schools was\n reported by Daniels (1976), who compared 30 matched pairs of community and\n noncommunity schools in Dade County, Florida. On average, he found a 60%\n lower dollar cost arising from vandalism in the community schools, both elementary\n and secondary, whether in inner city, suburban, or rural areas.\n However, not all research has shown that community involvement is effective\n (e.g., Greenberg, 1974). In a study of 18 San Francisco schools, Ellison (1975)\n noted that conversion to community schools as a solution to vandalism was\n favoured by principals whose schools were not yet converted, but was not favoured\n by those that had been converted. It seems that an essential ingredient is a prior\n phase in which residents have asked for such a program.\n The lack of efficacy of (unsolicited) community education was also reported by\n Schrock (1979) in a study in Virginia: There was no significant difference in school\n vandalism rates between community education and noncommunity education\n schools, though there was a suggestion that the former were an improvement. Steele\n (1978) expresses the probable need for commitment by the community:\n There is limited evidence to suggest that there may be less violence, vandalism\n and delinquency in some schools with programs of Community Education,\n but there is not enough information upon which to draw conclusions. If\n 282\nThis content downloaded from 128.95.104.66 on Thu, 20 Apr 2017 19:10:37 UTC\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\n ORIENTATIONS IN SCHOOL VANDALISM RESEARCH\n community support represents students and residents in the development of\n and participation in relevant programs, it is likely that school violence and\n vandalism may be reduced. (p. 84)\n Thus there are several factors that appear to contribute to the success of this\n particular strategy: (a) school officials must really want to involve the community\n (and must not do so simply because they have been told to); (b) the community\n must want to be involved; (c) the pupil must perceive his or her own and his or\n her parents\' involvement as positive. From the literature surveyed, it appears that\n programs with community involvement will work if, and only if, these three\n conditions can be met.\n Implications\n Studies of school vandalism typically ignore the ideological context within which\n both theory and research is founded. Our overview indicates that a whole range of\n strategies may be usefully employed in combating school vandalism. In the absence\n of an articulated theory, however, decisionmakers cannot do so on the basis of\n empirical evidence. Instead, they rely on intuitions and inclinations. If the vandal\n is blamed, "target-hardening" and punitive measures are employed. If the school\n system is faulted, changes are made to rectify its shortcomings. If community\n apathy is responsible, community involvement is encouraged.\n We believe that the failure of any one strategy to solve school vandalism lies in\n the nature of the system from which the phenomenon derives and in the diversity\n of approaches used to investigate it.\n We see the school as an open system within society. Innumerable variables,\n outside and inside the system, influence it. These include directives from govern-\n mental institutions; the legal system; the physical surrounding and design of the\n school buildings and grounds; the quality of the rapport among principal, teachers,\n students, and parents; the expertise of the teachers; the size of the school; the\n curriculum and specific assessment procedures in use; and the type of burglar alarm\n system in operation. It must be obvious that even if such variables could be isolated\n and their influence properly determined, their relative importance in the system\n would most likely change from school to school and from culture to culture.\n Because the result of a successful strategy may be explained with reference to the\n effect of a single variable, a group of variables, or even an interaction among several\n variables, there is no guarantee that success at one school will translate to another.\n In fact, a beneficial effect may even be explained by the "Hawthorne effect": Pupils\n will apply themselves more because they feel that teachers are beginning to show\n interest in them or because they are aware of the very act of participating in\n something new and special (Greenberg, 1974). Even studies that use a rigorous\n experimental design often omit reference to this possibility (Mayer & Butterworth,\n 1981). Moreover, the usual tendency to incorporate more than one method or\n program makes it even more difficult to understand which component may have\n been successful. The complexity of the open system and the diversity of the well-\n meaning but uncontrolled strategies adopted by desperate principals and school\n committees make it impossible to generalize from the findings at any one school.\n On the other hand, more comprehensive studies that, for the sake of external\n 283\nThis content downloaded from 128.95.104.66 on Thu, 20 Apr 2017 19:10:37 UTC\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\n ZWIER AND VAUGHAN\n validity, sample a large number of schools also have their drawbacks. The larger\n the data base, the more likely individual differences are excluded by the statistical\n process. Such results are bland. School vandalism occurs where students can ransack\n the school and get away with it; where students, teachers, and the community at\n large are apathetic; where students have come to view themselves as failures within\n the system; where schools are too large, too impersonal, or too ugly to inspire\n feelings of belonging or pride.\n This generalized picture makes sense, so much so that one imagines that the lay\n person could construct the same picture by intuition. Thus the results of large,\n multivariate studies appear to be no more than an abstraction, a modal school, not\n very often found in real communities.\n Our modal problem school also suggests its opposite, one with a good, positive,\n and constructive climate. How is this climate assessed? Is it based on expressive\n behaviors in pupils, good teacher-pupil rapport, even tidy buildings and grounds\n that are not vandalized? In other words, it is important to know whether climate\n influences vandalism, or whether (in research) it is an inference based partly on the\n relative occurrence of vandalism. Quite apart from this confusion in causality, there\n is another in a semantic and conceptual sense. Terms like climate, rapport, and\n incidence of vandalism probably overlap in the minds of many observers so that a\n good climate implies low vandalism and vice versa, by definition.\n So how can the social sciences contribute to an understanding of the causes of\n school vandalism? If it is indeed the case that (a) both its cause and the efficacy of\n any strategy employed vary from school to school, (b) extensive studies are bound\n to arrive at trite conclusions, and (c) the decision to use a given strategy is derived\n from an implicit ideology, what then should be the task of the social scientist? We\n think there are two options: (a) to continue the business of research as usual, in the\n hope that the tremendous increase in the number of projects, studies, and experi-\n ments anticipated in the next few decades will finally result in some comprehensive\n analysis of the real causes of school vandalism and of the best strategies in combating\n it; or (b) to replace this unrealistic set of expectations with an epistemological stance\n that accepts an ideological basis for school vandalism research.\n Traditionally, the researcher has sought to establish that school vandalism is\n caused by one major or several minor variables. Hypotheses are set up and tested\n for their veracity in the field. We might hypothesize that as school climate becomes\n more negative incidence of school vandalism increases. One investigator may find\n this correlation and infer that such a climate breeds vandalism. Another may report\n no relationship, leading to contradiction in the research literature, as has occurred\n in the case of Kaiser (1972) and Howell and Grahlman (1977). In a case like this,\n the usual reaction is that the evidence is ambiguous and that further research is\n needed.\n An important assumption of traditional social science research, then, is that one\n can determine whether two or more variables are related. This is how social science\n progresses-or is it progress? Despite the multitude of studies of school vandalism,\n we do not seem much closer to dealing with the problem. Its incidence has been\n correlated with numerous variables, and various strategies have been reported as\n successful. Against this, many other studies show contrary findings or report that\n the strategies do not work.\n 284\nThis content downloaded from 128.95.104.66 on Thu, 20 Apr 2017 19:10:37 UTC\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\n ORIENTATIONS IN SCHOOL VANDALISM RESEARCH\n At this juncture, a better purpose would be served by reconceptualizing the social\n science process. If we suspend the belief that the "real world" operates independently\n of our inquiry into it, we may understand that different, even contradictory,\n explanations of a phenomenon can be true according to conditions pertaining to\n each inquiry. This is a difficult point to grasp. The traditional social science\n approach has held that some theories are true and others false and that by testing\n derivable hypotheses we can establish which theories are correct. On the other\n hand, a recent view espoused by McGuire (1980) holds that each of several\n competing theories may be defensible and that fruitful empirical tests are those\n designed to reveal the limiting conditions of each theory. This means that our\n earlier hypothesis that a negative school climate is correlated with a high incidence\n of vandalism would give way to hypotheses such as, Under what conditions is a\n negative school climate correlated with a high incidence of vandalism? and, Under\n what conditions is a negative school climate not correlated with a high incidence\n of vandalism?\n However, to admit "conditional" hypotheses leads us to consider if each school\n studied is a unique case. For the moment, we may be forced to admit this very\n point and accept that practical research is one-school-at-a-time research. To do so\n raises another problem: If we cannot transfer knowledge from one situation (school)\n to another, we cannot correlate variations in conditions with the incidence of\n school vandalism across situations. Because scientific investigation demands some\n kind of variation to establish a relationship, we must seek this within a situation.\n This implies that research can discover only which variable(s) covaries with the\n incidence of school vandalism by manipulating selected variables at a particular\n school and observing the consequences. This manoeuvre amounts to introducing\n change within the system.\n What are the practical consequences for social science research? Because we\n should only assume for now that findings are school-specific and, importantly,\n because the research exercise is inextricably bound up with the ideological orienta-\n tion of the investigator, the role of the social scientist must change. Instead of trying\n to identify "real" causes, the social scientist should monitor conditions pertaining\n to a particular system, the school, and by doing so hope to obtain knowledge of\n the system itself. The most effective way of doing this is to observe the effects of\n change introduced into the system.\n Consequently, the traditional, static approach of social science research must\n make way for a dynamic one. The alternative to research as usual involves a radical\n change of course toward action research, that is, research that is aimed at changing\n existing conditions and carried out directly by those involved. Action research\n accepts that the social scientist plays an active role in the conduct of scientific\n research. It does not regard the investigator as a passive observer whose sole intent\n is to establish real causes. Instead, it assumes that (a) researchers are themselves\n active participants in the situations researched and that the researcher-situation\n relationship deserves to be studied; (b) the framework and variables of studies\n themselves change in the course of study; and (c) an important way of testing the\n validity and significance of social knowledge is to feed data back into the setting\n researched, studying how this feedback influences further action (Torbert, 1981, p.\n 437). Action research thus appreciates that the social scientist is an active participant\n 285\nThis content downloaded from 128.95.104.66 on Thu, 20 Apr 2017 19:10:37 UTC\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\n ZWIER AND VAUGHAN\n whose task is not merely to systematize that which exists, but also to invent and\n transform that which does not exist as yet (see Moscovici, 1972).\n Although action research has not (as far as we are aware) been carried out on\n school vandalism, many examples of this new epistemology (also referred to as\n participatory, endogenous, or dialectical research with slight changes in emphasis)\n can be found in Reason and Rowan (1981). This volume shows how action research\n has been applied to a voluntary desegregation program for elementary and middle\n school classes in the United States, to a group dynamics context, to a factory\n setting, to a prison environment, to rural settings in third world countries, and to\n the Norwegian banking system. The main emphasis of these studies is on the\n benefit for the subjects of participating in the research; the research is carried out\n with them, rather than on them.\n Action research abandons the attempt to uncover an objective reality. In the case\n of school vandalism, we would start by assuming that those involved in the school\n system are primarily responsible for deciding on a course of action. To begin with,\n an action committee would need to be formed. Ideally it should consist of the\n school principal, several teacher representatives, parents, and students. Such a\n committee must be distinguished on two grounds from established PTA\'s, school\n committees, or community advisory councils because it involves the student as a\n decisionmaker and the social scientist as a monitor. Consider the role of each.\n From the viewpoint of the student, only a few acts of vandalism (usually arson)\n are so serious that they disrupt the educational process. Furthermore, only a\n relatively small amount of all vandalism can be attributed to individuals who are\n fundamentally antisocial. Many more vandalistic acts are committed for a specific\n reason. As we noted at the outset, the term vandalism should be reserved for acts\n that are intentional and hostility-directed. Such acts are meaningful, they commu-\n nicate a feeling or thought on the part of the vandal, and the target is often\n deliberately chosen. (As a meaningful mode of communication, school vandalism\n is hard to beat: No other means is so direct, so anonymous, or provides one with\n such instantaneous results!) A reduction in the amount of school vandalism appears\n possible only if other, more acceptable channels and modes of communication are\n adopted. By involving the student at an early point in the decisionmaking process,\n we open channels through which grievances can be expressed and acted upon.\n School vandalism is not a problem to be solved by school authorities, but is a\n breakdown in meaningful communication. Through their representatives, constit-\n uent groups can take their share of responsibility and decide together which\n strategies to follow.\n The role of the social scientist as monitor is threefold: (a) to acquire and supply\n to the group as much information as possible that is specific to the school system,\n this information serving as a baseline; (b) to report in detail on any strategy decided\n on by the group, taking particular account of the expectations and beliefs of the\n persons involved, this strategy constituting the treatment of the problem; (c) to\n provide a fully documented description of the result, which itself completes an\n analogy with the clinical situation.\n The role of the social scientist as monitor, therefore, is directed to the changes\n implemented by the action committee. The social scientist is no longer merely\n 286\nThis content downloaded from 128.95.104.66 on Thu, 20 Apr 2017 19:10:37 UTC\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\n ORIENTATIONS IN SCHOOL VANDALISM RESEARCH\n giving an "expert opinion" on contemplated action, but is purposefully involved\n in that action, and is responsible for the analysis of its impact.\n Thus each action committee offers hypotheses for the occurrence of vandalism\n at that school. It is these tentative reasons (e.g., an authoritarian headmaster, a\n particularly vulnerable building, or a small group of ruffians) that must be trans-\n formed into appropriate action for that situation (e.g., modification of the leadership\n style, an upgrading of the building, or the development of a program that would\n occupy the boys more productively).\n Finally, we stress again that the knowledge generated by this process is specific\n to the situation in which it is acquired. The extent to which an implemented\n strategy succeeds may suggest some understanding of the probable reasons why\n vandalism occurs at the school. We hold that the "hit-and-run" studies so typical\n of social science should make way for the continuous assessment implied by action\n research. It is evident that cooperation in antivandalism strategies and, more\n generally, sustained commitment to participation in the organization of the school\n system, will greatly increase the likelihood of success in this assignment.\n References\n Arson, how to defend against the most destructive school crime.

aS'Vandalism: Environmental and Social Factors\n\n\n\n\nVandalism: Environmental and Social Factors\nGregory Brown Ann Sloan Devlin\nTo explore the relationship between vandalism,\ncollege residence hall size, and a\nnumber of social factors, 688 college\nstudents completed the Core Alcohol and\nDrug Survey (Presley, Meilman, & Lyerla,\n1994), the University Residence Environment\nScale (Moos, 1988), and answered\nquestions about their television habits and\nathletic participation. Vandalism costs came\nfrom college repair records. Larger residence\nhalls, those with more TV viewing,\nmore freshmen, and less student involvement\nwere likely to have higher vandalism costs.\nAlthough it is commonly asserted that vandalism\nhas its roots in aggression (DeMore,\nFisher, & Baron, 1988), the factors that\ninfluence aggression, and in turn vandalism,\nare numerous. These factors include the use\nof drugs and alcohol, gender, the influence\nof the architectural environment, and other\ncontextual factors. Vandalism involves acts\nthat are intentional, destructive, and affect\nproperty that is owned (Goldstein, 1996;\nMoser, 1992). Although purposeful destruction\nto schools, parks, public housing, and\ntransportation systems receives most of the\npress, college campuses are also susceptible\nto vandalism (DeMore et al.).\nTheoretically, vandalism involves a\nconstellation of factors. Early theories\nstressing instinct (e.g., Freud, 1920; Lorenz,\n1966) have been replaced by those that\nacknowledge the role of external stimulation\nin eliciting aggression (Berkowitz, 1993;\nBuss & Shackelford, 1997). The move has\nGregory Brown is a graduate of Connecticut College. Ann Sloan Devlin is Professor of Psychology at\nConnecticut College.\nbeen to integrate biological, sociological,\nand psychological explanations of aggression\n(Brennan & Raine, 1997).\nBuilding upon such explanations, Fisher\nand Baron (1982) proposed an integrative\napproach concerning vandalism in a comprehensive\ntheory of perceived inequity. In\nthis model, the goal of vandalism is to create\nequity for those who perceive that they are\ntreated unfairly. In an attempt to apply this\ntheory, DeMore et al. (1988) studied vandalism\nin university residence halls. They\nmeasured perceived equity and control\nthrough the use of questionnaires, and then\nhad students self-report whether or not they\nhad vandalized the residence halls. Results\nsupported the idea that vandalism was\ninfluenced by an interaction between perceived\ninequity and perceived control. Men\nwere more likely to engage in vandalism than\nwomen and also reported significantly lower\nlevels of equity and control than did women.\nIn a related finding in high-rise residence\nhalls at the University of Massachusetts,\nPropst and Propst (1973) demonstrated that\nthe more control students had over their\nrooms and use of floor space in terms of the\nflexibility of their furnishings, the less\nvandalism occurred.\nThese findings generally support the\nequity-control theory of vandalism. Yet\nDeMore et al. (1988) stated that other factors\nmight influence students to engage in\nvandalism. Gender was also shown to be a\nfactor in the DeMore et al. (1988) study. The\nauthors also recognize that the environment\nJULY/AUGUST 2003 X VOL 44 NO 4 503\nVandalism\nand other contextual and social factors may\ncontribute to vandalism. Furthermore, if\nvandalism and aggression are related, as has\nbeen argued, then stimuli that affect aggression\nin certain circumstances could also\naffect the likelihood that vandalism will\noccur. Thus, vandalism might also be\ninfluenced by the consumption of drugs and\nalcohol, exposure to television, and other\nsocial factors.\nAlcohol, Other Drugs, and\nAggression\nFew studies have actually sought to link\nalcohol consumption with vandalism per se\n(Norlander, Nordmarker, & Archer, 1998).\nDespite the limited research, Goldstein\n(1996) has shown that the consumption of\nalcohol has been a frequent precursor to\nvandalism. Korytnyk and Perkins (1983)\ndemonstrated that young men (introductory\npsychology students) who had consumed\nalcohol drew more graffiti than those who\nhad not, regardless of their belief about\nwhether they had consumed a drink with\nalcohol. In Hetherington and Keene\xe2\x80\x99s (1985)\nresearch at a large Midwestern university,\nstudents were classified into four groups\nbased on their pattern of consumption of\nalcohol: Abusers (more than four drinks at\na time, 2 to 3 times per wk), Weekenders\n(more than four drinks at a time, but once\nper week), Users (three or fewer drinks, 2\nto 3 times per week), or Socials (three or\nfewer drinks, once a month or less). Related\nto the topic of vandalism, 40% of those in\nthe Abuser group reported having damaged\nproperty following drinking. This level was\nalmost twice that of the Weekender or User\ngroups. Independent of group status, men\nwere more likely to get into fights and\ndamage property. Further, younger students\nwere more likely to drink more and men\nwere more likely to drink more often.\nBowles (1982) noted similar trends at the\nUniversity of Tennessee, Knoxville: more\nmen than women, more freshmen than\nupperclassmen, and more students who had\nbeen drinking than not were likely to be\ninvolved in acts of vandalism. West, Drummond,\nand Eames (1990) found similar\nresults with a sample of British college\nstudents (more men drinking, more men\ninvolved in vandalism after drinking).\nFurther, in a study of violence in residence\nhalls across 12 institutions, the reports of\nresident assistants indicated that 71% of\nthe violent events they experienced were\ndeemed alcohol related (Palmer, 1996;\nPalmer & Devine, 2000). Research has also\nindicated that students who were members\nof fraternities and sororities were more apt\nto consume and abuse alcohol and be involved\nin alcohol-related vandalism than\nwere students living in on-campus university\nhousing or off-campus nonuniversity housing\n(Globetti, Stem, & Marasco, 1988).\nEnvironmental Factors\nAlthough alcohol and drug use have been\nlinked to aggression in countless studies,\nmany other factors, such as environmental\ncues, have been shown to influence aggression.\nSometimes the very environment in\nwhich a person finds himself or herself can\ninfluence behavior. In this regard, Goldstein\n(1994) has discussed what he calls the\nphysical ecology of aggression. When\npeople live as closely together as they do in\nhomes (or apartments or residence halls not\ngoverned by familial structure), contact can\nlead to aggression through actual or perceived\noffenses (Goldstein, 1994). When the\nlocale is part of a larger institution such as\na school, there are even more possibilities\nfor aggression. For example, school size and\n504 Journal of College Student Development\nBrown & Devlin\nclass size are positively correlated with\naggressive acts (Feldhusen, 1978; Goldstein,\n1994).\nCrowding has also been shown to\ninfluence aggressive behavior, whether in\nhomes or in schools, with a significant\nnumber of aggressive acts occurring in more\ncrowded areas such as stairwells, hallways,\nand cafeterias (Goldstein, 1994). School\nviolence also seems to occur in schools with\noutdated facilities and equipment and poor\nfaculty morale (Greenberg as cited in\nGoldstein, 1994).\nThe fact that close quarters seem to be\nrelated to aggression has been studied in\nsome depth. It has been found that such\ncrowding effects are related to the personal\nspace requirements of individuals and even\nsuch things as the architectural arrangement\nof the residence hall (i.e., rooms off corridors\nvs. suites) (Baum, Harpin, & Valins, 1975).\nBaum et al. found that the degree of perceived\ncrowding was higher for those living\nin standard college residence halls, due in\npart to their corridor-based construction and\nthe hierarchical social structure that such an\nenvironment fosters, than for those living in\nsuites. Similarly, Zaff and Devlin (1998)\nfound that the elderly reported a greater level\nof conflict in high-rise housing (with doubleloaded\ncorridors) than in one-story garden\napartments.\nThe physical environment can also affect\nmuch less tangible aspects of behavior such\nas one\xe2\x80\x99s sense of community (Riger &\nLavrakas, 1981). The role of community\nitself is also an important factor, as it\nprovides a support network that can help to\nreduce perceived threats. Community can\nadd to one\xe2\x80\x99s perception of control, which in\nturn can help to curtail aggression and\nvandalism (Goldstein, 1994). Social interaction\nhas been shown to contribute to a\nsense of community (McMillan & Chavis,\n1986; Moos, 1976; Unger & Wandersman,\n1982, 1983, 1985) as well as to increase selfesteem\n(Goldstein, 1994).\nThe Media, Other Social and Developmental\nFactors, and Aggression\nSeveral other factors have been correlated\nwith aggression. One of the most well\nresearched has to do with the relationship\nbetween aggression and violence in the\nmedia (Huston et al., 1992). Countless\nstudies have documented that witnessing\naggressive models, whether live or recorded,\ncan increase aggressive responses in children\nand adults (Liebert & Sprafkin, 1988).\nBeyond media violence, other social factors\nhave been shown to increase aggressive\nbehavior. Group dynamics have been shown\nto influence behavior, and groups perpetrate\nmost acts of vandalism (Levine & Kozak,\n1979; Tobias, 1977). Fraternities and athletic\nteams have been studied in the past, due to\nthe close-knit features of each of these\ngroups, to discover the relationship between\ngroup dynamics and aggression. Both have\nbeen found to be groups in which aggression\nand aggressive acts have been encouraged,\naccepted, and nourished (Hirschorn, 1988;\nKoss & Gaines, 1993), although aggression\nhas been found to exist in fairly equal\nproportions in universities and colleges\nwhere such institutions do not exist (Koss,\nGidycz, & Wisniewski, 1987).\nAnother factor is gender. It is generally\naccepted that most vandalism is committed\nby men (Arluke, Kutakoff, & Levin, 1987;\nDeMore et al., 1988; Otta, 1993; Schreer &\nStrichartz, 1997; Ward, 1973). DeMore et al.\nexplained the greater incidence of vandalism\nin men as being created from a greater sense\nof perceived inequity.\nTheories related to college student\nJULY/AUGUST 2003 X VOL 44 NO 4 505\nVandalism\ndevelopment may also offer an explanation\nfor some of the findings. In research on the\npersonality development of students during\ncollege (Chickering, 1974; Chickering,\nMcDowell, & Campagna, 1969), many\nstudent characteristics are reported to\nchange. Of particular note is the fact that\nimpulse expression increases, and that the\npattern of changes across dimensions is\ngenerally in the same direction for both men\nand women. Further, one of the tasks of\ncollege students has been managing emotions\n(Chickering, 1969). Chickering (1969)\ncommented that aggression and sex are\namong the emotions not mastered by the end\nof high school, and that college offers the\nopportunity to improve judgment and\nsharpen cognitive processes. In Chickering\xe2\x80\x99s\nview, college residence halls \xe2\x80\x9cprovide a\nsignificant context for student development\xe2\x80\x9d\n(1969, p. 221), and the design and regulation\nof residence halls can either contribute to or\nrestrict the exchange of ideas. In particular,\nChickering encouraged lounge spaces that\nare centrally rather than peripherally located,\nand the design of spaces that are broken up\nrather than uniform, to allow the opportunity\nfor small discussion groups. He encouraged\nthe mix of \xe2\x80\x9cpersons of diverse backgrounds,\ndiffering interests, and differing values\xe2\x80\x9d\n(1969, p. 225) in housing. Supporting\nChickering\xe2\x80\x99s interest in a mixture of students,\nthere is no clear mandate for housing\nfreshmen together (Ballou, 1986; Cade,\n1979; Shelhas, 1977), at least in terms of the\nimpact of this arrangement on academic\nperformance (Ballou, 1985).\nColleges are obviously places where the\nopportunity for vandalism exists, where there\nis peer pressure, alcohol, and drug use, media\nexposure, residence hall living, and athletic\nparticipation. Although some research\nindicates that enforcement of alcohol and\ndrug policies can reduce vandalism at\ncolleges (Lively, 1998), alcohol arrests at\ncolleges are on the rise, up 25% in 1998\n(Nicklin, 2000), whether through tougher\nenforcement or increased use. Colleges thus\nprovide a fertile environment in which\nto study the factors that are related to\nvandalism.\nThe Study\nThe goal of this study was to examine\nvandalism as it relates to many aspects of\nstudent life on the campus of a small liberal\narts college. Unlike previous studies on\nvandalism, several factors such as alcohol\nand drug consumption, exposure to television,\nstudents\xe2\x80\x99 influence and involvement\nin their residence halls, residence hall size,\nathletic team membership, and gender, were\ninvestigated. Vandalism was operationalized\nas the cost of repair to acts deemed \xe2\x80\x9cvandalism\xe2\x80\x9d\nin records kept by the physical plant\ndepartment of a small liberal arts college.\nThe following hypotheses were formulated:\n1. Residence halls with fewer students\nwould have lower vandalism costs.\n2. Residence halls with higher levels of\nstudent influence and involvement\nwould have lower vandalism costs.\n3. Residence halls in which there were\nhigher alcohol and drug consumption,\ngreater exposure to television, and\ngreater membership on athletic teams\nwould have higher vandalism costs.\n4. Vandalism costs would be higher in\nresidence halls with greater proportions\nof men than women.\nPrevious studies on vandalism have\nsought to find relationships between one or\ntwo variables and vandalism, however we\n506 Journal of College Student Development\nBrown & Devlin\nsought to gain a more comprehensive picture\nof vandalism as it exists on a college campus.\nFurthermore, because vandalism was being\ninvestigated in terms of residence hall\ncharacteristics and profiles, this research\nmay be helpful in modifying existing\nhousing criteria in a manner that may reduce\nvandalism.\nMETHOD\nParticipants\nParticipants were 1,088 students at a small\nliberal arts college in the Northeastern\nUnited States. At the time of this study, 1,514\nstudents resided on campus. Of these 1,088\nparticipants, the data from 400 were eliminated\ndue to incomplete questionnaires,\nyielding an N of 688 for the primary analysis.\nSetting\nThe college has 22 residence halls (21 in use\nat the time of this study), most of which are\nmixed class (freshmen plus upperclassmen)\nand coed. There are no fraternities and\nsororities, and only about 30 students\nannually (almost all seniors) live off campus.\nStudents are governed by an academic and\nsocial honor code and share in the governance\nof the college (i.e., students have\nvoting members on the college committee\nthat sets priorities and makes budget recommendations).\nMaterials\nWe used the Core Alcohol and Drug Survey\n(Presley, Meilman, & Lyerla, 1994) to assess\ndrug and alcohol consumption. This questionnaire\nwas developed by the Core Institute\nat Southern Illinois University, and the\nauthors reported the reliability of selected\nquestions from .64 to .90 (Presley, Meilman,\n& Lyerla, 1993). From the 39 questions\n(many involving stems) in this survey, we\nanalyzed responses from the two questions:\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink back over the last 2 weeks. How\nmany times have you had five or more drinks\nat a sitting?\xe2\x80\x9d (none, once, twice, 3 to 5 times,\n6 to 9 times, 10 or more times). The second\nquestion (involving 12 substances) had the\nstem: \xe2\x80\x9cDuring the past 30 days on how many\ndays did you have\xe2\x80\x9d (tobacco, alcohol,\nmarijuana, cocaine, amphetamines, sedatives,\nhallucinogens, opiates, inhalants,\ndesigner drugs, steroids, other illegal drugs)?\nThis question thus produced 12 separate\nresponses for each participant. For each\nsubstance, the following response categories\nwere used: 0 days, 1 to 2 days, 3 to 5 days,\n6 to 9 days, 10 to 19 days, 20 to 29 days, all\n30 days. For purposes of analysis, the\nresponses to the alcohol and drug questions\nwere summed to produce a composite score,\nand divided by the number of questions. This\nscore is hereafter referred to as the composite\ndrug use score. Higher scores indicate more\nfrequent substance use.\nThe University Residence Environment\nScale Form S (URES) (Moos, 1988; Moos\n& Gerst, 1974) was used to measure the\nsocial climate of each residence hall. Form\nS of the URES is a 40-item questionnaire\nthat is divided into 10 subscales that measure\nInvolvement, Emotional Support, Independence,\nTraditional Social Orientation,\nCompetition, Academic Achievement, Intellectuality,\nOrder and Organization, Student\nInfluence, and Innovation. These subscales\nare then grouped according to dimensions.\nThe Involvement and Emotional Support\nsubscales constitute the Relationship dimension,\nwhich measures the level of interpersonal\nsupport, feelings of friendship, and\nstudent involvement, as well as the extent\nof staff support to students. The Personal\nGrowth or Goal Orientation dimension is\nJULY/AUGUST 2003 X VOL 44 NO 4 507\nVandalism\ndesigned to measure the emphasis on personal\nand social maturation including\ndifferent aspects of academic growth. It is\ncomprised of the Independence, Traditional\nSocial Orientation, Competition, Academic\nAchievement, and Intellectuality subscales.\nFinally, the System Maintenance and Change\ndimension, which is made up of the Order\nand Organization, Student Influence, and\nInnovation subscales, assesses the influence\nof students in running their residence hall,\nthe extent to which change is accepted, and\nthe degree to which the residence hall runs\nin an organized manner. Form S was selected\nbecause it was designed for use where living\ngroups are the unit of study. Results were\nanalyzed using the three dimensions: Relationship\n(R); Personal Growth (PG); System\nMaintenance and Change (SMC). Higher\nscores indicate a greater degree of the\ndimension. Scores for the R dimension range\nfrom 0 to 8; for PG they range from 0 to 20;\nfor SMC they range from 0 to 12. Moos\n(1988) reported that the intraclass correlations\nbetween Form S and Form R (the\nlonger Real Form) are all at least .86,\nindicating that the results of Form S are\nsimilar to those of Form R. The alphas for\nForm R for the 10 subscales range from .77\nto .88, with a mean of .82 (Moos, 1988).\nA third, short, researcher-designed\nquestionnaire was created to determine the\nlevels of participation in athletics (\xe2\x80\x9cDo you\nparticipate in a varsity or club sport this\nsemester?\xe2\x80\x9d), coded yes or no, and media\nexposure (\xe2\x80\x9cOn average, how much TV do\nyou watch per day?\xe2\x80\x9d). The television\nresponse choices were: 0 hours, 1 to 2 hours,\n3 to 5 hours, or more than 5 hours per day.\nVandalism was measured by residence hall\ndamage reports for the Fall 1999 semester\nthat were made available at the beginning\nof the Spring 2000 semester. These reports\ncontained just those events that were deemed\nvandalism by the Campus Safety Office, and\nwere subsequently broken down according\nto the residence hall in which the incident\noccurred. Such incidents as graffiti, holes in\nwalls, broken windows, and torn-down exit\nsigns were all considered acts of vandalism\nunless such incidents were considered\naccidental or fight-related, as this damage\nis not intentional, and therefore does not fit\nthe model of perceived equity and perceived\ncontrol. Each residence hall\xe2\x80\x99s extent of\nvandalism was then determined by the dollar\nvalue at which each incident was repaired,\nsummed across incidents. These figures were\nrounded to the nearest dollar. To make sure\nthat the dollar cost was a reasonable estimate\nof the extent of dorm vandalism, a correlation\nwas computed between the dollar\ncost of vandalism for each dorm and the\nnumber of incidents of vandalism in that\ndorm. It was significant, r(21) = .902,\np < .001, suggesting that the dollar estimate\nis a reasonable index.\nGender and class year breakdowns for\neach residence hall (and hence for all\nstudents) were obtained through the Office\nof Student Life and were also available\nthrough the Core data questionnaires for\nthose students who completed the survey.\nProcedure\nThis study was conducted in conjunction\nwith the Office of Student Life, which took\nresponsibility for the distribution of questionnaires\ninvolved in this study. The three\nquestionnaires were distributed at residence\nhall meetings following Thanksgiving break\nin the Fall 1999 semester. Students were\nstrongly encouraged to attend these meetings,\nbut attendance was not mandatory. A\nfourth questionnaire not associated with this\nstudy was also distributed at this time.\n508 Journal of College Student Development\nBrown & Devlin\nRESULTS\nResidence Hall Groupings\nTo examine the relationship between residence\nhall size and vandalism, we used\nquartiles to establish size categories. Category\nSize 1 consisted of five residence halls\nhousing between 12 and 46 students. Of\nthese five residences, four were on the\nperimeter of the campus and were of varying\narchitecture, whereas one was more centrally\nlocated on campus and was constructed of\ntraditional classical architecture. Category\nSize 2 had six residence halls housing from\n57 to 78 students. All six were on campus;\nfive of the six were traditional classical\narchitecture; the sixth was part of an\ninterconnected complex on the north end of\nthe campus. Category Size 3 had five\nresidence halls housing from 82 to 99\nstudents. Two of these were of traditional\nclassical architecture on campus; three of\nthese were part of the interconnected\ncomplex at the north end of campus. Category\nSize 4 was five residence halls housing\nfrom 104 to 115 students. Four of these were\ntraditional classical architecture; the fifth\nwas one of the interconnected dorms on the\nnorth end of campus.\nVandalism Costs and Other\nDependent Variables\nWe conducted a MANOVA to test the effects\nof residence hall size, gender, and athletic\nparticipation on the costs of vandalism, the\nthree URES dimensions, television viewing\nhabits, and the composite drug use score as\ndependent variables. To avoid the possibility\nof 4-way interaction effects, we conducted\na second MANOVA using class year, gender,\nand residence hall size as the quasi-independent\nvariables (with the same dependent\nvariables). The sample size for this analysis\ndiffered by one (N = 687) from the other\nanalysis because one participant omitted the\nclass year data. These results will be reported\nafter the first analysis.\nThe first analysis revealed a multivariate\neffect for gender, Wilks\xe2\x80\x99s Lambda = .949,\nF(6, 667) = 5.98, p = .000, and a multivariate\neffect for size, Wilks\xe2\x80\x99s Lambda = .374,\nF(18, 1887.05) = 43.56, p = .000. There was\nalso a multivariate interaction effect for\ngender and residence hall size, Wilks\xe2\x80\x99s\nLambda = .955, F(18, 1887.05) = 1.72,\np = .031, and a three-way interaction between\nsize, gender, and athletic status,\nWilks\xe2\x80\x99s Lambda = .958, F(18, 1887.05) =\n1.62, p = .048.\nFor gender, univariate effects indicated\nsignificant differences for cost, F(1, 672) =\n3.95, p = .047; television, F(1, 672) = 5.23,\np = .023, the URES SMC dimension,\nF(1, 672) = 8.71, p = .003, and the drug use\nmeasure, F(1, 672) = 16.92, p = .000.\nOverall, vandalism costs were lower for\nwomen (M = 7.48, SD = 5.77, n = 451) than\nfor men (M = 7.89, SD = 5.86, n = 237). Men\n(M = 2.03, SD = 0.82, n = 237) reported\nwatching significantly more television than\ndid women (M = 1.86, SD = 0.80, n = 451).\nMen were also significantly higher on the\ndrug use measure (M = 1.49, SD = 0.53) than\nwere women (M = 1.37, SD = 0.36). Women\nwere higher on the URES SMC dimension\n(M = 8.28, SD = 2.11) than were men\n(M = 7.70, SD = 2.19).\nFor residence hall size, univariate\nanalyses indicated a significant effect for\ncost, F(3, 672) = 326.71, p = .000; television\nviewing, F(3, 672) = 3.90, p = .009, the\nURES R dimension, F(3, 672) = 4.32,\np = .005, the URES SMC dimension,\nF(3, 672) = 5.02, p = .002, and drug use,\nF(3, 672) = 12.14, p = .000. For the vandalism\ncost variable, Tukey post hoc tests\nJULY/AUGUST 2003 X VOL 44 NO 4 509\nVandalism\nindicated that Size 1 residence halls had\nsignificantly lower costs than Size 2 (p =\n.000), Size 3 (p = .000), and Size 4 (p = .000)\nresidence halls; Size 2 residence halls had\nsignificantly lower costs than both Size 3\n(p = .000) and Size 4 (p = .000) residence\nhalls; and Size 3 residence halls had significantly\nlower costs than Size 4 residence\nhalls (p = .000).\nFor the television viewing variable,\nTukey post hoc tests indicated that residents\nin Size 1 residence halls reported watching\nsignificantly less television than either those\nin Size 3 residence halls (p = .015) or Size\n4 residence halls (p = .010). For the URES\nR dimension, Tukey post hoc tests indicated\nthat Size 1 residence halls had significantly\nhigher scores than Size 2 (p = .002), Size 3\n(p = .000) and Size 4 (p = .000) residence\nhalls. On the URES SMC dimension, Size 1\nresidence halls had significantly higher\nscores than Size 4 residence halls (p = .015),\nand Size 2 residence halls had significantly\nhigher scores than Size 3 residence halls\n(p = .008) and Size 4 residence halls\n(p = .000).\nFor the composite drug use measure,\nTukey post hoc tests indicated that Size 1\nresidence halls had significantly more use\nthan Size 2 residence halls (p = .000) and\nthat Size 2 residence halls had significantly\nless use than Size 3 residence halls (p = .000)\nand Size 4 residence halls (p = .000) (see\nTable 1 for the means and standard deviations\nrelated to size).\nInteraction effects. There were two\ninteraction effects related to gender and size,\none on the URES PG dimension, the other\non the URES SMC dimension. Simple\neffects follow-up tests for the PG dimension\nindicated significant differences between\nmen and women in residence hall Sizes 1\n(p < .05) and 2 (p < .01), but not for 3 and\n4. In Size 1 residence halls, men (M = 11.23,\nSD = 3.10, n = 26) had significantly higher\nscores than did women (M = 10.08, SD =\n2.64, n = 49), whereas in Size 2 residence\nhalls women (M = 11.04, SD = 2.64, n =\n122) had significantly higher scores than did\nmen (M = 9.97, SD = 3.09, n = 70).

The\nunivariate interaction effect between residence\nhall size and class year involved the\ncomposite drug use measure, F(9, 655)\n= 4.27, p = .000. Simple effects follow-up\ntests indicated that in Size 1 residence halls,\nsophomores had significantly greater use\n(M = 1.93, SD = 1.26, n = 16) than freshmen\n(M = 1.31, SD = 0.28, n = 6), Juniors\n(M = 1.50, SD = 0.46, n = 15) or seniors\n(M = 1.42, SD = 0.39, n = 38), all p < .01. In\nsize 2 residence halls, it was freshmen who\nhad significantly greater use (M = 1.30,\nSD = 0.37, n = 73) than sophomores\n(M = 1.19, SD = 0.31, n = 50), p < .05. In\nSize 3 residence halls, sophomores had\nsignificantly less use (M = 1.40, SD = 0.38,\nn = 65) than either juniors (M = 1.52,\nSD = 0.47, n = 41) or seniors (M = 1.54,\nSD = 0.46, n = 25), p < .05. Finally, in Size\n4 residence halls, sophomores (M = 1.50,\nSD = 0.36, n = 44) and seniors (M = 1.55,\nSD = 0.33, n = 46) had significantly greater\nuse than freshmen (M = 1.39, SD = 0.39,\nn = 97).\nCorrelations were also conducted relating\ncost to television viewing, the composite\ndrug use score, number of students in a\nresidence hall, and the three URES dimensions.\nThe costs of vandalism were significantly\nrelated to the composite drug total,\nr(988) = .091, p = .004, to television viewing,\nr(807) = .096, p = .006, to the URES R\ndimension, r(807) = \xe2\x80\x93.109, p = .002, to the\nURES SMC dimension, r(807) = \xe2\x80\x93.123,\np = .000, and to the number of students in\nthe dorm, r(21) = .770, p = .000.\nFinally, using campus-wide data\n(N = 1,514), a number of chi-squares were\nconducted to determine the distribution of\ngender and class year across residence hall\nsize. The chi-squared analysis for gender was\nnot significant, \xcf\x872\n(3, N = 1,514) = 4.06,\np = .255, indicating that the proportion of\nmen to women (about 45% to 55%) did not\ndiffer across residence hall sizes. In terms\nof class years, the campus-wide data revealed\na difference across residence hall size,\n\xcf\x872\n(9, N = 1,514) = 93.78, p = .000. The\ndifference appeared to be in the distribution\nof freshmen in Size 1 residence halls. There,\nfreshmen comprised only 8.3% of the\nresidents, whereas seniors comprised 45.8%.\nIn Size 2, 3, and 4 residence halls, freshmen\ncomprised approximately 30% to 40%,\nwhereas seniors comprised approximately\n15% to 25%. These analyses using campuswide\ndata paralleled those using collected\ndata, one indication that the sample was\nrepresentative.\nOnly collected data were available to\nexamine the relationship between athletic\nparticipation and residence hall size. A\nchi-squared analysis was significant,\n\xcf\x872\n(3, N = 807) = 17.48, p = .001. The difference\nagain appeared in the Size 1 residence\nhalls, where athletes comprised only 18.9%\nof the population. In the other residence hall\nsizes, the proportion of athletes to nonathletes\nwas about 35-45% athletes to\n55-65% nonathletes.\n512 Journal of College Student Development\nBrown & Devlin\nDISCUSSION\nThe results of this study suggest that\nresidence hall size, residence hall composition,\nstudent involvement and influence,\nand television-viewing time may be related\nto the occurrence of residence hall vandalism.\nThe significant positive correlation\nbetween the number of students in a residence\nhall and vandalism costs suggests that\nsize does, in fact, matter. Although residence\nhall size explains a significant portion of the\nvariance (59%), it cannot be the sole\nexplanation. Thus, other factors may help to\nexplain the occurrence of vandalism.\nAs hypothesized, another important\ncomponent may be the quality of student\ninvolvement and influence within a residence\nhall. Residence halls did differ in\nterms of the URES R dimension, which\nincludes the Involvement and Emotional\nSupport subscales, and the SMC dimension,\nwhich assesses the degree to which students\nhave a role in running the residence hall. The\nR dimension measures the level of interpersonal\nsupport, feelings of friendship, and\nstudent involvement in a residence hall.\nStudents in Size 1 residence halls had the\nhighest R scores, significantly higher than\nthose for students in the other residence hall\nsizes. Thus, higher levels of social support\nmay be related to lower levels of vandalism.\nA somewhat similar pattern emerged for the\nSMC dimension in terms of students in\nsmaller residence halls having higher (more\npositive) scores. Students in Size 1 residence\nhalls had higher scores than those in Size 4\nresidence halls, and those in Size 2 residence\nhalls were higher on this dimension than\nthose in both Size 3 and Size 4 residence\nhalls. These findings support the model of\nFisher and Baron (1982) in that having a\nvoice in running the residence hall may be\nrelated to levels of perceived equity and\ncontrol. The finding that smaller residence\nhalls had more involvement and emotional\nsupport is also related to the work of Oscar\nNewman (1973). Newman showed that when\nfewer people live together and share common\nentrances in public housing, they are\nmore likely to get to know each other and\nto exert territorial prerogatives over their\nshared space. Essentially, they are more\nlikely to protect that space against such\nactions as vandalism.\nAs hypothesized, the amount of television\nwatched also may be related to\nvandalism. The role of television viewing\nsuggests a different approach to student life\nin Size 1 residence halls, where there was\nless television viewing (between 0 and 1 to\n2 hours per day) than in Size 3 and Size 4\nresidence halls, where students reported\nwatching 1 to 2 hours per day. Students in\nSize 2 residence halls fell between, not\nsignificantly different in reported use\nbetween either Size 1 or Sizes 3 and 4. One\npossible explanation for the lower level of\ntelevision viewing in Size 1 residence halls\nmay relate to the greater percentage of\nseniors in these halls. During their senior\nyear, many students face significant challenges,\nincluding demanding academic\nprojects (e.g., thesis work and individual\nstudies) as well as graduate school applications\nor job searches. Less time may be left\nfor relaxation.\nIn contrast to the stated hypotheses, there\nwas no a clear-cut relationship between\nresidence hall vandalism costs and the\ncomposite drug use measure. On the composite\ndrug use score, students in Size 2\nresidence halls had the least frequent use,\nsignificantly less than those in Size 1.\nStudents in Size 2 halls also had significantly\nless frequent use than those in Size 3 and\nSize 4 halls. Although the costs of vandalism\nJULY/AUGUST 2003 X VOL 44 NO 4 513\nVandalism\nwere significantly correlated to the composite\ndrug use score and to the number of\nstudents in the residence hall, the residents\nin the smallest residence halls (Size 1) may\nhave felt a freedom to engage in more drug\nuse on the perimeter of campus (where 4 of\nthe 5 Size 1 residence halls were located).\nOne might be tempted to assume that seniors\n(secure in their identities and engaging in\nresponsible use) were responsible for this\ngreater use, but an interaction effect between\nresidence hall size and class year on the drug\nuse dimension indicated that in Size 1\nresidence halls, sophomores reported significantly\nhigher use than freshmen, juniors,\nand seniors. Thus, although Size 1 residence\nhalls had the lowest vandalism costs, the\nbehavior of sophomores in that setting might\nraise concerns about the distribution of class\nyears in housing that is more peripherally\nlocated.\nBefore reaching any conclusions about\nthe role of residence hall size in the costs of\nvandalism, it is important to consider the\ndistributions of men and women, athletes,\nand class year across the residence hall sizes.\nThe chi-squared analysis from collected data\nindicated that Size 1 residence halls differed\nin the proportion of athletes to nonathletes\nin comparison to the other three residence\nhall sizes, where the proportions were\napproximately 35-45% athlete to 55-65%\nnonathlete. In the Size 1 residence halls, less\nthan 20% of the students were athletes. This\nwas also the residence hall grouping with the\nlowest vandalism costs. This finding could\nbe explained by the peer-group influence\ntheory proposed by Levine and Kozak\n(1979) and Tobias (1977), with more vandalism\nin residence halls where there are more\nathletes, mirroring the findings in other\nstudies in this area (Hirschorn, 1988; Koss\n& Gaines, 1993); however, Size 2 residence\nhalls, which also have relatively low vandalism\ncosts (relative to Size 3 and 4 halls), did\nnot differ substantially from Sizes 3 and 4\nwith regard to the proportion of athletes. This\nfinding calls into question the role of athletic\nteam membership in the occurrence of\nvandalism. From the multivariate analysis,\nthere was only one result involving athletic\nteam membership, a three-way interaction\nwith residence hall size, gender, and athletic\nstatus. This interaction indicated that in Size\n2 and 3 residence halls, the PG scores of men\nwho were athletes were significantly higher\nthan those of men who were not, whereas\nno such differences occurred for women. The\nimplication of this finding as it relates to\nvandalism is not clear, especially because\nthere were no such differences in Size 4\nresidence halls, which had the highest\nvandalism costs. The role of athletic team\nparticipation in the occurrence of college\nvandalism merits further examination.\nAnother hypothesis was related to\ngender ratios in the residence halls. Of the\n1,514 students on campus, 43.9% were men.\nThe chi-squared analysis of the campus-wide\ndata indicated no significant difference in\nthe proportions of men to women across\nresidence halls; the proportion of men\n(~45.0%) to women (~55.0%) was similar\nacross sizes and reflects the proportions in\nthe college as a whole. Thus, the hypothesis\nthat vandalism costs would be higher in\nresidence halls with greater proportions of\nmen than women could not be evaluated.\nHowever, across residence halls, gender was\nrelated to the costs of vandalism. Even with\nthe preponderance of women on the campus,\nmen were still associated with slightly higher\nvandalism costs, which mirrors the finding\nin the literature that men are more likely to\nbe involved in vandalism (DeMore et al.,\n1988; Ward, 1973). Men also watched more\n514 Journal of College Student Development\nBrown & Devlin\ntelevision and reported more frequent drug\nuse. It may be appropriate to try to keep the\nproportions of men to women similar across\ncampus residence halls.\nAlthough no specific hypothesis regarding\nvandalism and the ratio of upperclassmen\nto underclassmen within residence halls was\npostulated, the data indicate that class\ndistribution may contribute to vandalism.\nFreshmen were associated with significantly\nhigher vandalism costs than were the other\nthree classes, and freshmen are underrepresented\nin Size 1 residence halls, the\nhalls with the lowest vandalism costs. Some\nof the differences in vandalism may arise\nfrom issues of maturity as Chickering (1969)\nhas suggested. Freshmen students may be\nmore likely to vandalize than upperclassmen.\nOther research has indicated that in residence\nhalls for freshmen, the first quarter of the\nschool year is a particularly difficult time in\nterms of alcohol use and subsequent sanctions.\nDuring this period, resident assistants\nand the students come to understand both the\nrules and the sanctions regarding underage\ndrinking (Rubington, 1991).\nIt is also possible that freshmen have\nmore of their academic life dictated, with a\nhost of requirements to fulfill, whereas\nupperclassmen have more control over their\nacademic choices, which may give them\nhigher levels of perceived control. The issue\nof control is also seen in the strong correlation\nbetween the number of residents in\nthe residence halls and vandalism costs: the\nmore students, the less likely the perceived\ncontrol. This finding suggests a relationship\nbetween social density and vandalism and\nis supported by Goldstein\xe2\x80\x99s (1994) work.\nAn argument can be made that students\nin Size 1 residence halls are self-selected,\nand may have been individuals unlikely to\nperpetrate vandalism under any circumstances.\nFor that reason, it is instructive to\nlook more closely at the differences and\nsimilarities between Size 1 residence halls,\nwhich have a greater degree of self-selection,\nand Size 2 residence halls, which have less\nself-selection. In particular, although the\nvandalism costs were somewhat higher in\nSize 2 residence halls, substantially lower\nvandalism costs occurred there than in either\nSize 3 or Size 4 residence halls. It might be\nargued that Size 2 residence halls provide a\nreasonable model to emulate, simply because\nmost colleges could not afford to provide\nenough small residence halls (fewer than 50\nstudents) for an entire campus.\nRecommendations\nThe findings of this study point to the\nimportance of residence hall size as a\npredictor of vandalism. Smaller residence\nhalls are less likely to produce vandalism.\nAlthough some variables are beyond control\nbecause they are not known in advance (e.g.,\nthe number of athletes), it is possible to\nmanage the distribution of gender and class\nyears across residence halls. The residence\nhalls should be as balanced as possible in\nterms of class year and gender, avoiding\nsituations where freshmen are more heavily\nrepresented than upperclassmen in mixed\nclass residence halls. It is also possible to\nhouse students in smaller residence halls (or\nto create smaller \xe2\x80\x9chouses\xe2\x80\x9d within larger\nresidence halls), to use programming to\nencourage less TV viewing and alcohol and\ndrug use, and to create environments that\nemphasize the opportunity for students to get\nto know one another and to exchange ideas\nwith people of varying backgrounds and\nopinions, in an effort to foster emotional\nmaturity. To the extent possible, it is also\nsuggested that athletes be distributed across\nresidence halls rather than concentrated in\nJULY/AUGUST 2003 X VOL 44 NO 4 515\nVandalism\nspecial housing.\nFuture researchers should examine the\nURES dimensions in relation to an actual\nmeasure of perceived control. Such a\nmeasure would relate residence hall characteristics\nand social variables with perceived\ncontrol. Additionally, the use of a self-report\nmeasure of vandalism, which could be\nrelated to the verifiable damage charges from\nphysical plant records, would be informative.\nAlthough the use of verifiable costs establishes\nsome objectivity, ideally, both objective\nand subjective measures could be used.\nCorrespondence concerning this article should be\naddressed to Ann Sloan Devlin, Department of\nPsychology, Box 5448, Connecticut College, 270\nMohegan Avenue, New London, CT 06320;\nasdev@conncoll.edu\nREFERENCES\nArluke, A., Kutakoff, L., & Levin, J.

aS'VIOLENCE AND VANDALISM IN OUR SCHOOLS\n\n 180 JOURNAL OF THOUGHT\n EDITORIAL\n VIOLENCE AND VANDALISM IN OUR SCHOOLS\n In 1974 Senator Birch Bayh headed a committee to investigate juve-\n nile delinquency. The committee surveyed 7^7 school districts en-\n rolling approximately half of the nation\' s school children. The survey\n revealed that over 100 students were murdered on school grounds in\n 1973, and vandalism ran over S00 million dollars. Recent NEA Teacher\n Opinion Polls indicate ^0, 000 to 60, 000 teachers are physically as-\n saulted every school year. 2 Although recognizing the gravity of the\n situation professional educators disagree on the best approach to\n reducing the scope of the problem. For example, the November issue\n of Phi Delta Kappa presented two ends of a continuum in responding\n to the violence and vandalism in our schools. Joseph Wint advocated\n the side of law and order emphasizing discipline and reported that\n this led to increased SAT scores and an end to violence at Wyandanch\n High School in Long Island. ^ Dennis Van Avery stressed a humanitarian\n approach to permit growth of trust, caring, feeling and sharing. 4\n He reported promising results. The problem of destruction and vio-\n lence is pressing. It requires educators best efforts at analysis.\n This study will explore two facets of the problem and suggest a\n tentative response to the growing problem of violence and vandalism.\n First, responsibility as a dimension of both autonomy and maturity\n will be explored. Second, emerging attention to and concern for\n solipsism will be analyzed. Third, there will be a tentative response\n to alleviate the increasingly destructive action of students.\n The act of vandalism or violence is assumed to be willful or mali-\n cious destruction of public or private property. The intent is to de-\n face or destroy. The issue is by no means new to our time. Marcus\n Aurelius noted that men suffer from one another, and perhaps the\n largest part of human suffering comes to man from those who he\n calls his brothers. He further indicated that every man should live\n in such a way as to discharge his duty and to trouble himself about\n nothing else. 5 The Classical- Christian tradition focused on respon-\n sibility, duty, and authority as the bedrock of certainty for social\n order. Administrative theorists have long used the Weberian model\n of Theory X as a symbol of traditional lines of authority and respon-\n sibility, with focus not on freedom but on uniformity of organiza-\n tional purpose. All these responses to human behavior were designed\n to protect and preserve the existing order. In the last decade there\nThis content downloaded from 128.95.104.66 on Thu, 20 Apr 2017 19:25:33 UTC\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\n JOURNAL OF THOUGHT 181\n has been a generalized revolt against authority and tradition, that\n Robert Nisbet feels is as great as any since the Roman Empire. 6\n Societies throughout history have sought to balance freedom and\n authority; rights and responsibility; immediacy and continuity with\n the weight of evidence on the side of external constraint providing\n parameters for individual acts. Fascism, Communism, Nazism, were\n forms of monism seeking to provide social order, not individual free-\n dom, as an answer to the age-old dilemma of rights and responsibili-\n ties. Western democracies were in a sense a social democratic ex-\n periment focusing on individual freedoms in choice and decision making.\n Educational systems in democracies sought to balance individual rights\n and responsibilities. A view of the nature of man which entailed a\n positive and optimistic expectation that individuals would and could\n perceive consequences of actions for the social good and act accord-\n ingly. Part of Western Democratic belief in such a potential for\n man can rightly be laid at the door of a religious tradition. The po-\n tential and possibility of individual acts done in line with regard for\n consequences is deeply embedded in faith.\n Admittedly, the unity of freedom and order, which lies hidden\n in the depths of the divine, remains impenetrable for the\n patchwork of our knowledge. We must be content to contem-\n plate the growth of freedom out of subordination - a fulfill-\n ment ultimately incomprehensible, yet still actualized from\n time to time . ^\n Man\'s unique capacity to communicate, to utilize hands and feet\n directed by a potentially rational mind never assures that these unique\n gifts cannot become weapons of destruction. Thus, the rise and fall\n of civilizations.\n Thomas Jefferson saw schools as the route to an enlightened and\n responsible citizenry to protect the republic from ignorance under\n whatever banner it operates.\n Whereas . . . experience hath shown, that . . . those en-\n trusted with power have, in time, and by slow operations,\n pre ver ted it into tyranny; and it is believed that the most\n effectual means of preventing this, would be to illuminate,\n as far as practicable, the minds of the people at large. ...\n This statement is an article of faith in the role and function of\n schools to protect and preserve an open society. He further notes\n the limits of freedom.\n The rights of conscience we never submitted, we could not\n submit. We are answerable for them to our God. The legitiThis\ncontent downloaded from 128.95.104.66 on Thu, 20 Apr 2017 19:25:33 UTC\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\n 182 JOURNAL OF THOUGHT\n mate powers of government extend to such acts only as are\n injurious to others. 9\n School authority represented by administrators and teachers was\n viewed historically as an obligation and duty to use whatever power\n available to minimize willful and malicious destruction and maximize\n responsible action. Vandals by their acts reject the authority repre-\n sented in and by the school. If this rejection rests in part on the be-\n lief that schools are not based on popular mandate, Slote notes: (1)\n Egalitarian ideas about institutional organization can be profoundly\n destructive when applied to higher education. Democracy does not\n require hostility to all forms of authority not resting on a popular\n mandate. (2) The student is or ought to be in a position of seeking\n to acquire some definable species of intellectual or practical compe-\n tence through an organized course of instruction. (3) On completion\n of this instruction the students\' achievement is certified by those\n who have supervised him through the school. (4) Students enter into\n an implicit contract with faculty and administration authorizing them\n to apply various kinds of pressures to encourage individual growth.\n (5) There is an implicit contract like that in the field of patient-\n doctor relation. In medicine self-determination involves the right\n to decide whether to seek medical care at all and if so to decide what\n kind of care to seek and from whom. It cannot involve the right to\n decide how a doctor is to treat a case since he was sought for com-\n petency the patient did not have. 10 Thus, school authorities are to\n represent a balance between freedom and order and to preserve con-\n servative functions of the school. One might argue that compulsory\n education takes away the student\'s right to choose not to attend\n school and thus vandalism is a rejection of forced schooling. Com-\n pulsory education implies a social contract between student and the\n society. It is not to be viewed as a threat but as an opportunity pro-\n vided at public expense for future participating citizens to gain a\n larger parameter of elevating vision. As Jefferson noted, the twin\n evil of bigotry and persecution could be avoided in the United States\n by a vigorous policy of enlightenment. "To penetrate and dissipate\n these clouds of darkness, the general mind must be strengthened by\n education. Thus, public education is a gift of a society to its\n youth .\n Vandalism implies a lack of purpose and an unwillingness to take\n responsibility for participation in society\'s best efforts to provide\n an enlightened citizenry. Individual responsibility for an act involves\n recognition of the consequences of that act on, toward, and for soThis\ncontent downloaded from 128.95.104.66 on Thu, 20 Apr 2017 19:25:33 UTC\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\n JOURNAL OF THOUGHT 183\n ciety. Recognition of consequences of an action infers autonomy and\n maturity. The autonomy of an individual is reflected in the ability\n to gain a sense of "ontological self -direction" which is the basis for\n developing a sense of human totality. It is this self-direction that\n provides an individual with the moral strength to act responsibly\n whether or not there is an authority figure in the school building.\n Acts of vandalism far too often reflect a dichotomy between respon-\n sibility for a given act and responsibility to others for that act. The\n vandal reflects a crisis in attitudes toward human beings, towards\n what we are, and to the facilities that represent social gifts to\n youths. The act of vandalism for whatever intent or lack of intent\n is a symbol of social decay, conflicting values, aimlessness and a\n protest against a system. A first response to vandalism is the de-\n velopment of \xc3\xa1sense of responsibility for individual acts. A religious\n sense of ontological self direction provides a base for autonomy and\n maturity in analyzing social consequences of action. A key perhaps\n that might be found in a religious sense is \xc3\xa1sense of purpose inhuman\n existence. Such purpose might well provide a bridge between the\n various stages of development set forth by Piaget and Kohlberg. The\n bridge could provide the transition from moral heteronomy to moral\n autonomy. ^\n A pragmatic sense of self direction entailing disciplined action in\n light of consequences of a given act was noted by Dewey. Dewey was\n careful to seek combining effective release of intelligence with per-\n sonal experience in the democratic way of living.\n I have done so purposely because democracy is so often and so\n naturally associated in our minds with freedom of action, for-\n getting the importance of freed intelligence which is necessary\n to direct and to warrant freedom of action. Unless freedom\n of individual action has intelligence and informed conviction\n back of it, its manifestation is almost sure to result in con-\n fusion and disorder. The democratic idea of freedom is not\n the right of each individual to do as he pleases, even if it be\n qualified by adding "provided he does not interfere with the\n same freedom on the part of others.\n The concept of moral autonomy is inherent in process of growth\n through disciplined inquiry in light of individuals attention to the\n quality of experience. Such focus on quality underlines skill, ability\n and capacity to balance freedom and authority. Vandalism might well\n be the result of what Dewey referred to as the "lost individual", or\n one who has lost loyalties which once held individuals by giving them\nThis content downloaded from 128.95.104.66 on Thu, 20 Apr 2017 19:25:33 UTC\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\n 184 JOURNAL OF THOUGHT\n support, direction and unity of outlook on life. ^ Whether this loyalty\n is found through a religious sense or a common faith in the potential\n for individuals to act responsibly, the role of school authority whether\n reflected by administrator or teacher, is to channel individual search\n toward moral autonomy and maturity. No one blends religious sense\n and common faith better than Whitehead:\n What I am now insisting is that the principle of progress is\n from within; the discovery is made by ourselves, the disci-\n pline is self -discipline, and the fruition is the outcome of our\n own initiative. . . . The ultimate motive power, alike in\n science, in morality, and in religion, is the sense of value,\n the sense of importance. It takes the various forms of won-\n der, of curiosity, of reverence, or worship, of tumultuous\n desire for merging personality in something beyond itself. 16\n Thus,* is set the route for emerging out of immediacy and into a\n sense of meaning, purpose and value in human existence.\n Current emphasis on value clarification games focus on self esteem,\n empathy, warmth, rapport, communication, self exploration and\n analysis. These concerns are important in developing affective do-\n main learnings and understandings. Yet, the danger lies in a sense of\n overemphasis, overfocus, on self rather than on others. Passionate\n intensity of the moment, immediacy, feeling, self gratification - all\n work to the detriment of a sense of responsibility for the other in\n space and time. There tends to be a lack of awareness to the long-\n term consequences of a given act. A rock thrown through a window\n is a destructive, violent act based on immediate gratification, not\n on the longterm consequences. An integrative, holistic concept of\n response and participation is lacking. There is lack of understanding\n of the role of the individual as a model maker through and in his human\n participation. 17 There is further a lack of perception of man as a\n "world -shaper. "1\xc2\xae The challenge of solipsism is its sense of aliena-\n tion, isolation and separation of act and consequence. Acts of van-\n dalism are not separated from consequences. Such acts result in\n increased social burdens whether through more restrictive agents or\n increased forms of security. No man is an island. We cannot act in\n isolation and without social consequences. Nor can duty or responsi-\n bility be separated from freedom and rights. They are interrelated\n terms. A student has a right to attend schools which have not been\n vandalized. A teacher has a right to work in a classroom which has\n not been vandalized. Thus, vandals take away the rights of others.\n The balance between rights and responsibilities requires a careful\nThis content downloaded from 128.95.104.66 on Thu, 20 Apr 2017 19:25:33 UTC\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\n JOURNAL OF THOUGHT I85\n analysis of the danger of excesses of solipsism. Social orders may\n be endangered with a wave of immediacy disrespecting rights of\n others and failing to understand the consequences of acts.\n Perhaps part of the problem of overemphasis on self and immediacy\n grows out of current acceptance of a narrow focus of humanism.\n Maslow for example refers to the good life of the self-actualizing\n person. He notes self -actualizing people are gratified sufficiently\n in all their needs. Maslow speaks of forces within the individual as\n found in sentences such as I need to . . . "This we may call \'inner\n requiredness1 and it is felt as a kind of self-indulgence rather than\n as a duty.""^ Carl Rogers refers to valuing in the mature person as\n openness of the individual to experiences within himself .20 The con-\n cept of ontological self-discipline is not always clear in such state-\n ments. The commitments of religious and philosophical ought are\n missing. This is not to deny the importance of self analysis, explora-\n tion and satisfaction, but to suggest overemphasis and focus on needs\n and underemphasis on duty neglects the reciprocal relationships be-\n tween authority and justice; freedom and control necessary to any\n society. It is the main business of the family and the school, Dewey\n notes, to influence directly the formation and growth of attitudes\n and dispositions emotional, intellectual and moral. 21 This is a call\n to disciplined action in light of social consequences therefrom. Sidney\n Hook finds of skepticism and indifference toward lawful acts:\n To be law abiding in some circles is to be "a square". . . .\n Therefore, our goal must now be to build up and strengthen\n a mood of respect for the law, for civil obedience to laws. . .\n To have the positive law on the side of right and justice is to\n have a powerful weapon that makes for voluntary compli-\n ance. . . . 22\n Democratic societies require sharing, consensus and respect for\n self and other. Willful and malicious destruction of public school\n property requires rethinking theories of individualism to develop new\n coping strategies. If such rethinking requires us to look to religious\n commitments and common faith in disciplined inquiry of history, we\n should not tarry of fear of being called traditionalists. Stressing\n balance between the dimensions of actions in light of requirements\n for organized society merely reflects reciprocity between freedom\n and justice. Order in action reflects to a degree order in thought.\n Ontological self-direction and purpose enables individual and social\n stability, continuity and disciplined change. As C.I. Lewis notes:\nThis content downloaded from 128.95.104.66 on Thu, 20 Apr 2017 19:25:33 UTC\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\n 186 JOURNAL OF THOUGHT\n The mind will always be capable of discovering that order\n which is a requisite to knowledge, because a mind such as\n ours, set down in any chaos tkat can be conjured up, would\n proceed to elicit significance by abstraction, analysis and\n organization, to introduce order by conceptual classification\n and categorical delimitation of the real, and would through\n learning from accumulated experience, anticipate the future\n in ways which increasingly satisfy its practical intent. 23\n There are no easy answers to vandalism. However, tentative pro-\n visional suggestions to lessen if not eliminate the most glaring, costly\n abuses will be attempted. Increased participation in decision making\n processes where feasible and possible would gain \xc3\xa1sense of belonging\n and purpose among students. Specific educational aims in operation\n demonstrate how specific schools have dealt with vandalism. Sunny-\n vale Scho\xc3\xb3l District in California initiated a number of community\n projects which led to a sense of belonging to a group with a purpose,\n a sense of identity and responsibility. In time a total community\n approach to engaging youth in a variety of activities from field trips,\n dancing, recreational activities, gardening and landscape clean up\n projects developed \xc3\xa1sense of autonomy and ontological self discipline\n which greatly reduced school vandalism. Students were engaged in\n planning activities during and after school both in respect to their\n own projects and in respect to student- faculty-administration deci-\n sions. 24 As Dewey noted, "Absence of participation tends to produce\n lack of interest and concern on the part of those shut out. "2^ Stu-\n dents and teachers should have the opportunity to participate in the\n formation of aims, methods of materials, even rules of the school\n of which he is a part. 26 Dewey reinforced his belief in the positive\n effects of participation in decisionmaking by noting "habitual exclu-\n sion has the effect of reducing a sense of responsibility for what is\n done and its consequences. "27\n The delicate and difficult task of developing character and\n good judgment in the young needs every stimulus and inspira-\n tion possible. It is impossible that the work should not be\n better done when teachers have that understanding of what\n they are doing that comes from having shared in forming its\n guiding ideas. 28\n The administrative role in maintaining an organizational climate\n conducive to positive discipline inquiry and maturity in care for school\n facilities is clearly pointed out by Dewey:\n The administrator will conceive adult education to be a necesThis\ncontent downloaded from 128.95.104.66 on Thu, 20 Apr 2017 19:25:33 UTC\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\n JOURNAL OF THOUGHT 187\n sary part of his job ... in the sense that only as the public\n is brought to understand the needs and possibilities of the\n creative education of the young, can such education be vitally\n effective. He will realize that public education is essentially\n education of the public; directly, through teachers and stu-\n dents in the school; indirectly, through communicating to\n others his own ideals and standards, inspiring others with the\n enthusiasm of himself and his staff for the function of in-\n telligence in the transformation of society. 29\n The function of intelligence refers to self direction, autonomy and\n standards of conduct generally accepted by the social order. Thus,\n quality of action is viewed in terms of social consequences of these\n acts. In 1931, John Dewey noted that thinking takes place in a scale\n of degrees of distance from the urgencies of an immediate situation\n in which something has to be done.^O\n He further noted that the first, if most limited consideration, is\n the range and vitality of the experience of the thinker himself, that\n is, his most direct personal experience . . . which may be personal,\n curtailed, one-sided, distorted. The remedy, however, is not isola-\n tion, alienation from society but rather increased acquaintance with\n the experience of others both contemporary and historical Surely,\n this is a route to assisting in decreasing if not eliminating the under-\n lying causes of vandalism under whatever banner it flies. As youth\n are brought into varied activities in decision making and projects in-\n volvement with others, they will gain not only a sense of personal\n worth and value but of self, directed, purposeful discipline. Such\n involvement will eliminate or lessen frustration, alienation, isola-\n tion, and a lack of relationship with institutional purposes.\n We have explored responsibility and solipsism with a provisional\n analysis of educational aims that might respond to the underlying\n causes of vandalism. In conclusion, Dewey in Human Nature and Con-\n duct relates the primary themes of this paper:\n Liability is the beginning of responsibility. We are held ac-\n countable by others for the consequences of our acts. They\n visit their like and dislike of these consequences upon us. In\n vain do we claim that these are not ours; that they are pro-\n ducts of ignorance not design, or are incidents in the execu-\n tion of a most laudable scheme. Their authorship is imputed\n to us. We are disapproved, and disapproval is not an inner\n state of mind but a most definite act.

We intend that you shall deliberate before you\n do it again, and that if possible your deliberation shall pre-\n vent a repetition of this act we object to. . . . The individual\n is held accountable for what he has done in order that he may\n be responsive in what he is going to do. Gradually persons\n learn by dramatic imitation to hold themselves accountable,\n and liability becomes a voluntary deliberate acknowledgement\n that deeds are our own, that their consequences come from\n us. 32\n REFERENCES\n \xe2\x96\xa0\'\xe2\x96\xa0Willard McGuire, "What Can We Do About Violence?"
